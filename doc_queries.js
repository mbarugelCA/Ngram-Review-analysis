docs =  ["I am a Comcast business class subscriber. I used the business line for a home office in Chicago. Comcast constantly goes down. I would say that at least twice a month for the past 10 months, there is always a problem affecting the area. Since the line is leased, cancellation comes with a hearty price. \r\n\r\nWhen contacting Comcast it is the same story. The best one was that their DNS was down. I found this an odd reason, considering that I run a local DNS which doesn't even use the Comcast DNS. I suppose, point and click problem solver 2.0 doesn't take this into account because if their DNS doesn't work, nothing does?", "I have had numerous issues with Comcast. My internet speed occasionally slows down to a crawl. They have sent techs out to my house but they said there was no problem with my internet speed. I have tried my wife's laptop to be sure it was not my computer and it is not.They always give me the brush off. I am computer literate and have more savvy than most of their employees.", "They installed on time. They didn't tell me that I'd need to pay $5 more per month for their static IP address. It worked OK for 2 weeks but I started having outages. On the 2nd tech visit, the modem was replaced. After 3 more random outages, I began to really track the problem. The outages are random and the time down is random. If I power the modem off and on, I can usually restore service. If I call, the tech at the other end can \"bing\" the modem at a higher signal and the modem starts working. After doing more research on this issue, it appears that in my area, they've sold too many users for the available cable. As such, users get bumped periodically. This is a business line.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I can get out of my contract since it's now 45 days since installation. When it's up, it works as described. It just isn't up 24 hours per day as described and it's a pain to have to turn off and on the modem all the time, especially since I know I'm probably bumping someone else off.", "Hope 1 Star means very poor service.\r\n\r\nI made a payment on 8/10/2011, which was applied to my closed residential account and not my current business account with Comcast. Since that time, my business services have been disconnected 4 times for non-payment.\r\n\r\nEach time I contacted Comcast I was told that the payment would be credited to my business account, but it has not. As of today, I was informed that their practice is to issue a check within six weeks. I was assured that someone from Comcast would contact me to inform of the status of account. However, these were false statements because my service being interrupted is the only indication that the issue has not been resolve. (On several occasions I have contacted Comcast to see if the issue is resolved. At the time I was told that it would be noted on my account).\r\n", "We left Comcast for another internet service provider. The big issue was not the internet service but, instead, issues with the administrative side of Comcast (difficulties with bill pay, the website, customer service, etc). I did not expect that the more serious problems would begin after ending the service.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, I have been billed for \"equipment\" that we did not have, because we already owned the necessary equipment and chose to use our own. After terminating the service, they began billing me for the equipment. Over the years, I spoke with many Comcast customer service people and collection agency reps. Each time, I ended the conversation believing that something had been resolved. In one of those conversations, I was asked about the equipment I had in my possession. I provided the manufacturer and model, and was told that Comcast had never carried that equipment. Finally, I thought, as usual, that the problem was resolved, but no. Inevitably, I would hear from another collection agency about payment for equipment.\r\n\r\nAbout three to four weeks ago, I was told, with sarcasm, that Comcast would run the serial numbers in their inventory to see if they had the equipment, and I would receive a letter as to the findings in 10 days. The customer service rep made no attempt to hide his belief that I was lying about having the equipment. I couldn't help wondering why it took three years for someone to even make the offer. I had little faith in their inventory, because the company had proved themselves to be incompetent, but my only other options were to pay for equipment I never had or file a lawsuit. I checked the mail today, and there was no communication from Comcast. I braced myself for yet another phone call from their customer service.\r\n\r\nThe customer service rep checked the account and told me that they had received my equipment. I really had to hold back when I told him that they didn't receive anything from me, because I never had the equipment. Apparently, the equipment was found in their inventory. I wanted to know why I didn't receive a letter. I told him that, after all this time and being led to believe that the problem was resolved so many times, I wanted something in writing. He couldn't send a letter, so he called another department. The second department conveyed they could not issue a letter. Instead I would have to go down to an office to get a letter. That would be a half-hour drive (one way) for me and standing in line for an eternity, and honestly, I don't believe anything would come of it. I would lose at least half a day. Since the mistake was not mine and I have been put through hell over this, I believe they owe me something, and for God's sake, all I'm asking for is a letter. So, even after resolving an issue, the company is absolutely impossible to deal with. Fixing mistakes is almost completely in the hands of the customer. Now, I have to wonder how long it will take to get this off my credit record.", "I am a new customer at Comcast and a technician came to my home to install my internet service.  \r\n\r\nIn testing the modem, the technician said that he had no signal and needed to access my wiring in my backyard.  Once he left and my internet was up and running, my DirectTV no longer worked.  I called DirectTV and they troubleshoot everything they could.  They came to the conclusion that whatever wiring job the Comcast technician did had screwed up my DirectTV connection.  \r\n\r\nI called Comcast at least ten times this week and nothing.  I was told that a technician would come out to fix the wiring in my backyard and that I did not have to be home.  But when I got home that night, there was a note on my door that said, \"Sorry we missed you.  Please call back to reschedule.\"  What an idiot. The technician came but did nothing! \r\n\r\nI have called back today and got a real attitude from Curtis ** who said that he was a supervisor.  He didn't even care that I was inconvenienced by Comcast and I am now going on a week without a TV.  \r\n\r\nI don't know how this company is still in business.  The employees have no customer service skills and the company itself provides substandard service.  I have filed a complaint with the FCC and BBB this morning and now I'm going to write my congressman and the local TV stations.  I have names of everyone I spoke with and will mention them all.  After they come and fix my issue, I'm switching to Cox Cable.", "My husband and I got a DVR in April 2011.  We were told that we would need to put a $100 deposit on DVR.  I told them that was fine.  Well, I had to return the DVR.  I asked them if I could use the deposit for last month's bill and they said no problem.  I got a call from them and they said we owe them $190.  I told the guy that I was told I could use the deposit for this month's bill.  But I was informed that the money was used for a bill that was past due.  I informed him that was not what I was told.  And to top it off, the guy was rude and told the guy good bye. \r\n\r\nI called back a little while later and asked to speak to a supervisor and told her what was going on.  I told her that I wanted the $100 back on my account.  All she said was that she could give me $50.00 for all the trouble that I had been through.  I told her I wanted to talk to one of her supervisors.  She made an appointment for me to talk to him.  He called back about an hour later.  When I told him what was going on, he told me that he would make sure that everyone would be informed of what had happened, so it would not happen again.  I told him that I felt like I lost my money, because it was not used for the right thing.  I told him that he needed to have more communication with his people.  If they had told me that the money was going for a bill, I would have not had any problems with that.  But since I was told differently, I feel that I was misled.  I told the guy I talked to that I would tell people not to use Comcast since they are a joke.", "On 11/10/2011, a universal box near the property caused snow and lines on Xfinity TV. I reset it when tech cut reception. He finished 45 minutes later. All channels were good before 9:45AM and before the tech entered the box in the yard! I called and was refused for help two times by a rude representative, Phil. The rep said it was caused by a problem with snow. It is from bad connection from the box outside.", "Comcast bottlenecks my internet if I use too much bandwith. They never provide me with the speed I pay for which happens to be their top speed. They make me go through the same tests every time they purposely slow my internet connection. First, they told me it was my splitter, so I bought a new one. Then they told me it was my router, so I bought a new one. Then they told me it is because I am not using their router, which they never offered before until recently?! After I got rid of cable TV and returned my box with remote, got rid of the splitter, they still charge me every month for the cable box. \r\n\r\nI called numerous times, one person even said he would take the charges off. They never did. They said they would research it and never got back to me either. This was over a year ago. Every time I tell them, this only happens when we all play games or live stream on the internet. They deny it has anything to do with them and say it's my modem and or router or am I using a splitter. We can have a tech come. Somehow, our internet works perfect as long as we just use it for browsing or checking emails. They lie about the advertisement too, I pay for their best connection and was told we could all play online games with no interruption by their sales lady who claims to have been a former AT&T employee. I was told this when I told them I was fed up and going to AT&T.", "Starting just over 2 months ago, we have had interrupted Internet service. It incapacitates our business because it means we have to reboot our modem physically. It\u2019s impossible while we are working remotely. The service people have been here three times but they cannot fix it. Anyone else in Southeastern Pennsylvania having this problem? We are going to have to move to Verizon Fios.", "I asked if someone could explain to me my bill, it had charges of $158.84 then credits of $102.99, then they say they had a total that I payed $261.83 and then they say i owe on $55.85 on 12-01-2011. As I am on autopay, they deducted $154.90 out of my account, so I ask the billing lady what about this. Her answer was just don't pay any mind to those figures. So what the heck is going on at this place.", "I order basic internet service from Comcast on Sept 8. They came out connected, thought everything was fine then I waited the week or so they said they would be sending me a bill never got it. So I called and they couldn't find my account, find out it's in my sisters name. I tell them they made a mistake and it was suppose to be in my name so they go, okay not a problem and tell me it's been changed in my name. Bill comes in my sister's name which I thought was strange my sister calls gets disconnected and I call tell then they made the mistake and to put the internet in my name. I tell them about and they go again telling me okay, it's done. \r\n\r\nHere it is now October. I wait for them to reconnect my service and a week goes by the two, no service. I left town for a few days thinking they'll come out and take care of it, never did. So I called and say, \"hey what's going on with my internet.\" They say it's connected and I'm like no, it is not. I had my computer on and for the last week or so and nothing, no lights blinking on the modem, nothing. So I go telling them about it for like 3 days then I get a tech telling me, \"Oh, it connected in my sister's name, hold on let me put this in your account. It won't take a minute.\" Then he does it and it's connected. \r\n\r\nThen out of curiosity, I ask them about my internet package and he tells me my package was $57 dollars a month. I was like, \"wait you people have messed up again, I was ordering basic service $19.99 a month.\" He goes, \"oh it says and I say this mix up mess up has been going on for months.\" Now he tell me he's going to correct it, tells me it's been on for months this way and I go to check my computer to find out I have been charged this $57 a month. When I ask for $19 service, I find out I had the $19 service connected but being charged for the $57. My speed was 1.5 mbps and the $57 was like above 12. \"You have been ripping me off from the start.\" \r\n\r\nThen they finally get it fixed and I get a bill of 230 dollars for what 19 dollars a month which finally was corrected in November. You gotta be kidding me. Then I find out you people charge for a month in advance which is another rip off half the time your service drops speed or is down in some areas and your telling me we have to pay you for service we don't have. I will be reporting this to the Better Business Bureau. This is your so called good business plan, well it sucks.", "<p>My internet has been out for three days with intermittent service.  When I called in, I got the same script each time.  I scheduled a service visit five days out. That's the soonest available.  However, I asked for a technician to check the outside of my house sooner, maybe they could drive by to see if there is a problem outside. </p>\n<p>Yesterday when I called Comcast, they told me there was on outage in my area.  They can only come and check out the inside first. They don't check the outside first. The lame person on the phone said they couldn't send someone out to look on the outside and that I would need to keep my appointment if I wanted service.  Comcast is a horrible company with horrible customer service!</p>\n", "<p>I had no service for three months, and I am now in their collection department. I attached my complaint to their corporate office.</p>\n<p>I signed up for phone and high speed Internet service with you guys on May 25, 2011. I have had a horrible experience from the beginning; the representative who came to my house left and did not mention his departure. I did not have a change to talk to him, or ask him any questions. I was entering into a business with Comcast on the premise that Comcast would port my number (805-938-1964) from Verizon. I wondered why I was not getting too many calls. I realized a few days later that I did not have the same phone number. I called the customer care department; I instructed them to continue my Verizon service until the number finished porting, so it would not be lost. I did the phone verification after that point-- on four different occasions. </p>\n<p>Last month, I spoke with someone who told me that the number finally ported over, and I could cancel my Verizon service, which I did. Annoyed that I had to pay service for two additional months to Verizon (paying for two service providers), I signed on the other night to pay my bill for the first time, as some of the months were refunded. I recalled the girl at the office (I went down there to scream after we were in month two) telling me that she only felt that Comcast should refund half of the fees, it did not matter that my phone was not working and paying a second service provider. At this point I knew I owed around $155.</p>\n<p>I attempted to make an online payment for the first time. When I attempted to sign in as a new user, the site informed me that I was given a temporary username and password from the guy who left my house and didn\u2019t have the decency to say, \"Hey, stupid I\u2019m done with my work, and I\u2019m going home.\" So again, I called the 800 number to resolve this. To my shock and dismay, it turned out my account cannot be found because I have some other phone number, not the one that was supposed to be ported; 805-361-0345 is this new number that I ended up with. </p>\n<p>Again, I pleaded for someone to help this begging consumer. That time when I got nowhere, I had a great idea. I reached out to the sales team on the 800 number. I sell financial services, so naturally I realized that the sales force is some of the best employees that Comcast has. The level of empathy and accountability was awesome from your sales team the other night, and I was feeling confident that this was getting resolved. I was told that I was wrong. The number was ported over (805-938-1964), but there are some processes that need to be in order to complete the porting. I was assured by your employees that on Monday morning I would receive a courtesy call to confirm that all was complete. I did talk to that employee regarding my unwillingness to pay for a service I have yet to receive. The employee calmed my concerns. I was told that once everything was complete, all the charges would be reversed and will start up as of that Monday, when the service is finally working. </p>\n<p>I left my office and cell phone numbers. Still, I have not heard from your company. What do I have to do? How many more months will this go on? What does a consumer have to do to purchase your service? Is this how far you like to degrade people by making them beg, and take work hours out of their day to give you money? I am so insulted and turned off by your company. I am demanding resolution. I am also filing this complaint with the Federal Trade Commission so that other consumers will be protected against this sort of degrading treatment of your client\u00e8le.</p>\n", "<p>I'm a new Comcast customer and I signed up on March 25 for a bundle deal where I would get a $100 rebate in the form of a prepaid master card (I think). It's been so long I can't remember.</p>\n<p>According to the agreement, the rebate should have been issued in mid-July. Well, here it is mid-August and I have heard nothing from Comcast. I have however called them several times. One call was a promise for a manager to get back to me in 2 days. Well, I can assure you that never happened, no one called.</p>\n<p>So, I placed another call. This time I got an account representative named Joe who informed me I need to wait another 4 to 6 weeks. I mentioned the agreement that I remembered where I have already served the appropriate time period. And he just repeated to me, \u201cYou will have to wait and that's the way these things are handled\u201d, (in a smug tone).</p>\n<p>I asked for the call to be escalated and was transferred to another manager (I guess) named Greg. If I had to say anything about Greg it would be \"he should not be in the customer service area\". He seemed more annoyed by my issue than sincere. All of this was playing out while I was watching a Comcast commercial referencing their customer promise guarantee.</p>\n<p>Well I did get another promise from Greg (after 20 minutes of arguing), where I could call him back (dare him call me?) if I did not get the promised rebate in another week. This time period has come and gone again and there is no direct contact from Comcast. The phone number he gave me was a general voicemail account. I doubt I will hear from him again.</p>\n<p>There seems to be a lack of accountability in this (and many other) organization(s). There doesn't seem to be any more of the management that champions issues. I would not recommend this company as they lack respect for their customers. I'm not saying this just because they seem to have ripped me off for $100. Not at all. It's the customer service I'm referencing.</p>\n<p>There are many more details I simply didn't explain here that indicate this. I'm also sure that somewhere up the management chain there is indeed someone that truly cares about my $130 per month that I pay (on time) each month.

This is because the service orders were written incorrectly.  Hence, another service order had to be written and another tech had to come back on another day.  This has been going on for 3 months.

Internet is for $29.99 or $10; cable, for $65.54 or $75.  However, Comcast wants $300 a month for services that were not given or started. This is fraud on the account.", "I have been using Comcast high speed internet for a long time. It works fine until recently, I got no signal with my Comcast internet connection. So I called Comcast tech support, and they tried helping me on their end, but still could not figure it out, so they told me they will send a service people out to my residence. Two days later, the Comcast service tech called me and asked me if the problem still exists, and I tried again and it looked OK, so I told the service guy need not to come to do the checking since it works again. But the Comcast guy insisted to come.\r\n\r\nAfter he took a look of my cable modem/router, he said everything looked fine now -  the cause may be due to the Chicago water facility works surrounding my neighborhood, and he left. Three weeks later, I received my monthly statement from Comcast which included a $30 charge for the service I just mentioned. I called Comcast customer service, and discussed with a service rep my case. She then discussed with her supervisor and called me back and said, \u201cI am sorry, but this is a legal charge. We can not return your money back to you.\u201d Above is my true experience with Comcast recently. I just like to warn others who are currently using Comcast service, be aware of the unreasonable, unfair charge you may get, even if the problem is not in the customer's end.", "I have signed up for auto-pay but they are not billing my payment method. I have attempted to use my credit card to submit payment online but it fails every time. This is not a problem with my credit card. I've checked with the credit card company. This problem has persisted for over 6 months. No one can accept payment over the phone. I cannot submit payment online. Comcast has a serious problem. I've submitted multiple online emails for resolution. I lodged complaints on the phone..so far no resolution.", "I really would like internet from Comcast.

Thank you.", "I called tech support on Thursday, 5/31/2012, to report my internet service out. The tech on the phone walked me through several troubleshooting steps but could not get the system running. He made an appointment for home repair for Saturday, June 2, 2012 between 1-3pm. I made it extremely clear to him that my home phone was also out due to no internet service. I told him the only phone they could reach me on was my cell phone. He understood and made a change of phone number on the work order. \r\n\r\nSaturday morning, I made a call to tech support to make sure they had the right phone number on the work order. The lady assured me that it was 3pm, Saturday. No service tech. I called tech support, talked to a Curt. He assured me that his tech was just late, be patient and he would be here. I also reminded him of the number to reach me. He said yes the tech had the right number. Curt also told me congratulations. Because the tech was late, Comcast was going to credit my account $20. How nice but guess what, no truck ever came. \r\n\r\nI called Comcast and got a recording saying our service was cancelled because the tech could not reach us. Guess what number they were calling, my home number that didn\u2019t work. Back on phone, I got a live woman from Georgia. She called me Mr. ** and told me she would solve my problem. She got me another appointment for Sunday, June 3, 2012 at 8-9 am. She positively assured that the problem was solved. She made it fool proof for the tech to call the wrong number. She even gave me another $20 and 6 months of HBO free. \r\n\r\nSunday morning 9am, no service tech. You aren\u2019t surprised to hear that right. Does this Groundhog Day the movie called Comcast at 9am? The woman I spoke to said, oh I know what the problem is. The bad computer doesn\u2019t know that your home phone doesn\u2019t work. She said I will fix it. I will take that bad number out of the computer and enter my cell number. No more mistakes. The woman assured me I would hear from the tech within 3 hours to give me his arrival time. Eight hours later and guess what, no call, no service tech. I just can\u2019t believe that there are that many people employed at Comcast that don\u2019t remotely know how to order repair service or just don\u2019t care. The old 8 and skate crowd.\r\n", "In March 2011, I joined a leads group from the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce. My sister and I were getting ready to open up a gift store in downtown Fort Wayne. A representative from Comcast was a member of that leads group. She talked to us about a great deal Comcast was offering at that time - $129 for 2 phone lines and internet service. Knowing we were going to need these services for our gift store, I told her I was interested and she gladly set everything up for me. She never once mentioned anything about a $300 installation fee or having to sign a three-year contract. She had me sign for the service.\r\n\r\nAfter the services were installed, I received a bill for over $400 and was shocked. I did pay the bill even though I was upset she never mentioned the installation fee. Today, June 27, 2012, I called to cancel the service since my sister and I are closing our gift store. That's when I was told I signed a three-year contract and I would have to pay a $2,000 fee to get out of the contract! I was beyond shocked! First of all, she never even mentioned that I was signing a three-year contract. I never would have signed a three-year contract because my lease was only for two-years!\r\n\r\nThis Comcast representative never mentioned anything in regards to not being able to cancel this service at will. It's very deceptive and after reading the thousands of complaints, I'm not sure where to turn. A supervisor was supposed to call or email me but nothing. I want to nip this in the bud now before this turns into something that drags on for months. I don't trust them as far as I can throw them!", "I will take a moment to email, but after what we have been through this past week, this really is a waste of time. We had started two months ago to get a number ported from AT&T because we wanted to keep a business number that the company has used for almost 30 years. There were three attorneys in our office. The Senior Attorney, Mr. George ** was retiring and Mr. Richard ** and Mr. David ** wanted to keep the number. Mr. ** was told this process was completed last Monday, July 23, and we were waiting for Comcast to do their part.\r\n\r\nTo much ado and many telephone calls to Comcast corporate office, Monday and Tuesday came and went with no Comcast assistance. Mr. ** had a vacation planned with family for quite some time and was scheduled to leave the office on Thursday, July 26, returning on August 2nd. Mr. ** had finally been assured by four corporate personnel that on Wednesday, July 25, between 11:00 and 1:00, the telephone and internet would be connected. We didn't see any Comcast technician between that time. Finally at 3:00PM, a third party technician showed up without proper tools and left. He told us he would return first thing the following morning to get this taken care of. \r\n\r\nWe didn't see the technician the following morning, so I called him on the cell number he gave us. I was told that since the number was being ported, he would have to wait ten days. That was the first time this was mentioned to any of us. Earlier, I had mentioned this process had begun two months earlier and we were told the port was completed and Comcast could proceed. I spent the whole day on Thursday speaking to several contacts in your corporate offices to see when this would happen. I did receive a call on Thursday from Richard ** from your corporate offices and was told there would be a technician Friday morning from 9:00-11:00. \r\n\r\nI did call at 9:15 AM on Friday and spoke to Michelle ** or ** in your corporate office and she told me that there was still time. I actually was trying to get started early to be sure someone would show up. Well, 11:00 came and I finally called Richard ** again to let him know that no one had come out. He started to give me a story about why we didn't see the technician between 9:00 to 11:00 and I had said, \"Look, I really don't want an apology and don't want to hear it.\" His manager, Brent or Brett called back and we were told something would be done on Friday. At 3:00PM on a Friday afternoon, when most people leave early for a weekend, the technician showed up. \r\n\r\nBy this time, Mr. ** has left on Thursday for his vacation that I know he has not enjoyed because he has been on his cell phone constantly to check on updates. I did leave the office at 3:30 on Friday because I had already planned to leave early. While I was out of town on Saturday morning, I received a telephone call from Fernando ** to check on the telephone and internet status since he was out of the office on Friday. I told him we had gotten internet started, but not completed, but we really needed our telephones. He called me back 20 minutes later and told me there would be someone at our office at 8:00AM sharp. I told him someone would be there to meet them. \r\n\r\nI received a telephone call from one of the paralegals in the office at 9:15AM on Monday that the technician had not showed up. Finally at 10:00AM, a Comcast technician showed up. I just spoke with the paralegal and we still are not completed with internet. The technician hasn't even started on the telephones. I tried desperately to locate a telephone number for Brian L. Roberts, which I was told was the CEO, hoping I could get some help. I had left a message on a home number that I was able to locate from my internet at home but of course, no one answers the telephone. I did find a 215-286-8960 and spoke with someone about an hour ago and was told she was going to check into this today and get back with me. \r\n\r\nI have spoken to Richard ** along with his supervisor numerous times, Fernando ** numerous times, Undrea with your Corporate Escalation, Michelle ** or ** and would have certainly thought speaking with corporate personnel that are supposedly right under the CEO, one would hope would get some satisfaction. Another day is half over. We don't all have internet connections but most importantly, we don't have any phone service. Mr. ** left on vacation on Thursday without any communication with his clients or any new clients. We have had no communication whether it be by telephone or internet all last week from any new clients that would have tried to get in touch with him or Mr. **. I would have to say that this truly has been a nightmare. I would like someone to contact me regarding this matter at your earliest convenience.", "So many things have gone wrong with Comcast that I will not explain them all but what made my family and I stop their service was this. We were only paying for internet because we had Hulu, Netflix, and Xbox for entertainment purposes. We were paying $70 a month for their fastest service provided. Since I live in an apartment building, I figured that the slow speeds were from the many people on the service. It was getting bad, Hulu would freeze and Netflix would freeze. Finally, I called them after 3 months of this going on. I was told that there was a bad signal in my apt. and that a tech would come out. \r\n\r\nSo the tech came out and there is a box in our apt called Honeywell where he looks in and says there are some damages inside and he was surprised it did not send a signal to Comcast telling them that it was not working right. So he got on our laptop and fixed it and said, \"restart everything and all should be good.\" Well after he left, he came back because he forgot his tool bag and to top that off after he was already gone, I found that my laptop was no longer receiving a wireless signal so I called Comcast and asked them what he did. They said in order to fix it, I would need to pay to speak to a tech that could assist me. \r\n\r\nI was **, this guy came to my home and he uninstalled my wireless card on my laptop and Comcast wanted me to pay for them to fix my mistake and they said for it to be free, we would have to wait 3 days for a tech to come take a look. Thank God 3 hours later, I found out how to reinstall it. I also was mad they did not want to fix it. So when I got my bill that next month, I thought that the tech might have put a note stating that I had not been getting the service I was paying for for 3 months but no, everything was still the same. \r\n\r\nAfter seeing my bill, I contacted customer support live on their website and after 15min. of me telling the person what was going on and I did save to my computer the whole chat log, he stated, \"We will refund you money from the point of when your service was interrupted.\" So I'm thinking, \"great, I get 3 months pro rated\" but then the next bill came and they gave me a $20 discount. Their equipment was faulty and even the tech said he couldn't believe that the computers couldn't pick up this error sooner.\r\n", "I moved and notified Comcast. I turned in my equipment to a Comcast center. I was told I did all I had to do. A month later, I received a bill for Xfinity signature support. I explained to 7 different Comcast people that I cannot have the service for my computer if I do not have Comcast service. They agreed. However, since one division of Comcast does not communicate with the other, I had to pay for a service that they could not provide and did not tell me I had to call direct to cancel. I believe that Comcast is committing fraud. They charge for a service they agree they cannot provide. The year-long experience with Comcast was terrible. The installation was terrible. Service person was rude and did not care. The company needs to revamp their telephone reps. They are not able to solve problems and are uninformed about the services that Comcast provides.", "For the past 16 days, we have attempted to obtain internet service from Comcast. During this time, we have been to the Comcast office one time, chatted with customer service 5 times, techs have come to the house 6 times, and they just completely did not show for appointment 3 times. Apparently, O. C. Communications is the contractor Comcast is using in California and they, very obviously, cannot scale to effectively perform the workload of Comcast, as evidenced by their obvious state of severe disarray. Inept, arrogant, and contemptuous are all good descriptive terms. \r\n\r\nCraigslist frequently contains a long list of open positions listed by O.C. Communications. You can tell the O. C. Communications people hate their job because most of the time there is some excuse for not performing the work or they just don\u2019t show up at all. There also seems to be a major disconnect in communications both between Comcast and O. C. Communications, plus a more severe communication problem within O. C. Communications. The company names should be changed to CantCast and O. C. MisCommunications.", "Our home burned last year. When we moved back home, I called Comcast. They came out to install and dropped the box on our new wood floor. We made the guy fill out a report. We took it to Comcast and had the floor company come out and do the repairs to the floor. We have made many trips trying to get paid back what we had to pay for the repairs. It has been almost a year and they have not paid. Then we got our first bill. There were all these charges we never even knew what they were, DVR, huh? We do not have DVR and don't want one so they took the charges off. They also overcharged us for internet. We called and fixed that also. \r\n\r\nWe had a lot happen. My mom got very sick and we had to take care of her. She passed away in May this year and we had to take care of all her things also. We did not get a bill last month. We got the bill today and guess what? Hmm, there it is, all the old charges we asked to have taken off and more. We went back and looked at our bill and they have been charging us for DVR and high speed and we had so much going on that we did not know it. Wow, I wonder who ordered it. I hope everyone looks at their bill very closely and call them monthly because they will try and rip you off. Look closely. Also, they do not have $19.99 Internet. When I call and say that is what it says online, they will tell you that is not offered any more. It is $27.99. Also, they will overcharge you. So please look at your bill. ", "I have spent nearly a year attempting to resolve service issues with Comcast. I have called customer service dozens of times, had technicians come to my home at least 7 times and even filed a complaint with the BBB - All with no resolution. My transfer speeds are a fraction of what they should be. I run a business from my home and often find my self unable to transfer the client files needed to do my job. I have replaced my modem (numerous times), router and even my computer. The lines in my home were replaced in 2009 and were deemed \"perfect\" by a technician. All the technicians assured me that my equipment is not at fault and that there is a problem with the lines. However, they leave here promising to escalate the issue. Then when I call to check the status, I'm told that the ticket was closed and there was no escalation.\r\n\r\nEvery time I call Comcast, I am forced to start from the beginning explaining the issue. None of the phone reps are willing to look at the notes on my account from all my previous calls. I have heard over and over that my area is experiencing a \"stage two outage\" - one that apparently never ends. I have been told that I should rub the coaxial cable on my shirt \"to get static out of the lines.\" I have been told that all 4 of my computers are broken, that my brand new modem is broken. Any excuse you can imagine, I've heard.\r\n\r\nI just need my service to work properly. As I said, I run a business from my home and I'm often unable to work. I am paying for a service that only works intermittently and cannot get any answers about the problem. Trying to get in touch with anyone from Comcast regarding this issue just results in being transferred from person to person, followed by yet another technician who visits my home, scratches his head and closes the ticket without doing anything to fix the problem.", "Comcast should be shut down because of criminal practices. Comcast never installed the correct equipment needed for us to access the services we are paying for. This has been going on for half a year. We are paying $159.99 each month, and our problems still are not resolved. This company has a monopoly, and they know it.", "I ordered a modem through Comcast website under a rebate offer. I found it to be quite misleading. When I wanted to return the modem that had not been opened, I was told I would be charged for their shipping charges, plus 20%. I thought the equipment was under Comcast, since I ordered it on the Comcast website. It turns out to be a third party company. I was not sent a receipt from the company. I did not see anything about their expensive return policy. Comcast was not helpful when I called for help. I will cancel Comcast service as I am not happy with their customer service. I tried to call several times before I got through, and the hold time is over 20 minutes. It took me 46 minutes to make a call to Comcast. In the past, I had have good experience with Comcast. I just don't understand why this time, it is very unhelpful. I am looking for an Internet provider that is excellent in customer service, in both the services offered as well as any product they sell. It's very upsetting dealing with companies that don't care or respect their customers.", "I would like to receive a bill each month. This seemed to be very difficult for Comcast to do. I supposedly have a credit of $396.80 (according to the internet), $396.38 (according to their recording on the phone) and every month, I have to call and request my bill showing how much they are charging me and what credit I still have. I think that most customers do not pay attention to their bills and are charged randomly. Last month my bill was $158.69. This month was supposedly $161? They can't tell me why or what went up and have not yet sent me a bill. Why is this?", "I chose Comcast/Xfinity to be our DSL and alarm provider, but their actions were not professional from the beginning. We were given a few credits by their corporate office for several no shows, in which one caused us to miss the delivery of important information for our uncle's funeral. The installation person would say that he would be at our house at a certain time, but he did not show up or give a courtesy call. This would jeopardize our work schedule because most of the appointments were on a weekday.\r\n\r\nComcast/Xfinity finally installed the equipment, but the billing credits had not been posted and the balance represented the wrong promotional rates. This caused the bill to be incorrect; it continued to be incorrect throughout the months of service. I have made many requests for them to produce a correct bill. Here is a list of problems that I have attempted to resolve with Comcast/Xfinity: \r\n\r\nThis is the message that I receive as I access the Comcast.net portal to check and control things in my house, while out of town: \"Page Error; your account has been suspended. Please contact your service provider to resolve the situation.\"\r\n\r\nMy bill has been incorrect since February 2013. Although I have made every attempt to get a bill that shows the correct amount, I continue to see the wrong amount. Internet speed is supposed to have been the fastest, but it seemed sometime slower than my regular AT&T internet speed.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had my alarm checked more than once, I still experience the same problems. Four times this past month, I have come home and entered my code to disarm my home alarm. The alarm continues to beep after I have entered the code several times, until the siren finally sound off. Tanisha ** (Executive Customer Relations Houston Region) sent someone out to check this problem. He diagnosed the problem as the code being entered too fast. If I enter the code and one digit does not respond, I will not get another chance to re-enter the code and disarm the alarm. This will eventually lead to the alarm siren sounding. If my alarm constantly triggers, my neighbors will soon ignore it and that leaves opportunity for a real burglary to occur unnoticed. Another problem is the complaints of my alarm going off early in the morning and in our quiet neighborhood; it is disturbing my neighbors. I did not have this problem with my old alarm system!\r\n\r\nMy email system no longer keeps track of when someone enters or leave my house.\r\n\r\nI could not monitor or control features in my house for weeks all because of reasons mentioned. I made several requests for Mrs. ** to give me the service that I paid for or cancel my contract. Without any attempt to resolve the problems and give adequate service, she immediately canceled my service the same day. I believe this decision was made to avoid giving the credits that were supposed to post to my billing account. I also believe that her decision was an attempt to avoid honoring the very low promotional rate that was offered in the beginning. When I spoke to her the same day that she disconnected my service, she told me that I would not receive a refund for the poor service received the entire time of service. She also made sure to inform me that by taking this matter up with corporate CEO (Brian Roberts), it will only trickle back down to her.\r\n\r\nI sent Mrs. ** a final email as an attempt to get her to correct the problems. I told her that I'd really rather have this situation resolved and allow them an opportunity to give better service. She told me that my service had already been cancelled and it would cost me installation fees again. She also informed me that the special promotional rates would not be available. This definitely demonstrates how unethical and unscrupulous Comcast/Xfinity is to their customer. To lure a customer in with promotions and not give the service that is expected, but cancel the customer's account instead of attempting to resolve the problems is just ludicrous and immoral.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that my full service be restored along with the same promotions that were tied to the account; I also need all issues and concerns resolved: I need my bill to reflect the proper amount online moving forward. I need the keypad that does not properly work replaced with one that does work. I need to be able to control and monitor my system online without error. I need your system to do everything that Comcast/Xfinity advertised it to do. I need my high speed internet to reach the speed advertised in the promotion.\r\n\r\nMy house that was monitored under Central Security is unmonitored and can be broken in at any time. If service cannot be restored, I would like a full refund of any amount paid to Comcast/Xfinity!", "Comcast essentially has a monopoly in our area, with all other choices being as bad as their services. I have felt overcharged, abused, and have been flat-out lied to about my services and billing. I can't wait for Comcast to go out of business forever.", "I've called Comcast multiple times to complain about the speed I am getting from WiFi. They have been telling me to purchase a plan so that they can  troubleshoot the issue. Their technician confirmed that problem is with the equipment Comcast provides. I am getting decent speed if I am hardwired. I have one of their high plans as per which I should get at least 30mbps but I am getting only 5 Mbps.", "You can spend hours on the phone with Comcast and get no problems resolved. They ask you for all your information then transfer you to someone that can not help you after getting all your information. Then that person puts you on hold and then disconnects you. So you call back again and start that process all over again. Don't get RJ (**); Demetrius (**); Denise (**) Adriane ** (**) or Laura (F squiggly line at top of your computer 4) because they are going to waste two hours of your time. Even after you go into their office no one can get your correct address in their system. Finally someone can disconnect your security service but they will charge you $1100 disconnection fee that no one ever bothered to mention.", "Customer service has always been exceptional. Downtime is minimal (we use the bundled services) - tell me about any company with no downtime - you can't. If it impacts my business for an extended period, they have given refunds. The only thing I don't like is the price. If any other company could equal their product and service, I'd move. Huge kudos to the techs who have come to help with installations and complicated WiFi issues. Every time they've been here, they could be textbook examples of great customer service.", "About 8 channels on my conventional TV (both HD & SD) went blank (black screen). After usual runaround, a technician visits. He fiddled around and left. Next visit on 9/9/13 resulted in swapping cable box, wires, splitter to phone Inet, etc. Assured \"problem was outside on pole\" and left. NO change in TV behavior. Next visit, 9/12/13. Tech REPEATED all previous steps! Changed cable box, added a new piece of hardware (don't know WHAT it is or for). He also had his eye on my internet/phone service, but I would not let him touch it!\r\n\r\nHe was here 4 hours! (He was very hard to understand verbally). Departed. Result - can't turn TV on or off, can't control volume, DVD player inactive (cannot access start or play). 9/13/13 21:00 hrs first call to Comcast. Assured by person just a matter of remote programming. \"He had a little difficulty in getting codes\". Would call me back by 22:00 hrs to reprogram remote. Of course, never did. 22:00 approx. 2nd call .Young lady tried best to help. Tried reprogramming remote (she had no trouble getting codes!). No go. NEXT appointment ,9/16/13 09:00 hrs. These are just highlights. Tech #3, during his 4-hour visit, even had to borrow tools from me! Comcast support is a disgrace.", "I specifically asked the internet sales representative if the charges for service were a flat rate which would not increase drastically like most contract deals, and was assured it would stay the same... Four months later it has increased 40%... I consider the sales tactics of Comcast to be deceptive at best and outright fraud at worst. I am sure they spend more on advertising than customer service and don't give a rat's ** about their customers... SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND GET A DIFFERENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "After having Comcast/Xfinity internet service over 7 years, I received a notice saying they had failed to charge me rental for my modem for that 7 years and I would now be charged $7 for it. The very modem they gave me 7 years ago for signing up - 7 years! After an endless battle, I sent them the 7 year old modem and bought a Netgear modem from Best Buy. I thought this would solve the problem - wrong. For the past 4 months, I have had to call each month to have the $7 rental removed. Each month, the rep claims the problem is resolved. Just noticed I was charged again! They obviously aren't concerned with their customers and the needless irritations they create with pathetic attempts to bring in a few more dollars!", "Over the years, I have had half a dozen different internet service providers. The most inconsistent internet signal and unhelpful technical support has been, by far, courtesy of Comcast. Rarely will I go more than an hour without having internet service slow to next-to-nothing or drop out completely. I have tried contacting customer service, but their \"solutions\" seem like they are just buying time to drop a charged service call on you that I would never expect to make anything better. Since everyone I know that uses Comcast has the same connectivity issues as I do, I'm going to use some deductive reasoning and conclude that the service is just bad and nothing will ever be done about it as long as they are the only high-speed internet service option. Enjoy your horrible reputation and piles of cash, Comcast.", "I have repeatedly tried to use the Xfinity numerous times. The service is very, very unstable, with one exception: the commercials play flawlessly. Must be nice to be a monopoly. In case you haven't realized already, I DESPISE Comcast.", "To be honest, I am frustrated at the lack of customer service and what seems to be poor communication within the Comcast Company. From March 1st until the end of May, I did not receive Comcast Internet service because of ongoing and unresolved issues. During this time, I still paid anywhere from $48-$79 per month. The Internet was shutting off multiple times a day, leaving a small window of an hour or so to use it. We would attempt to reset the modem, check for loose cables, stop and restart everything, but most times this did not work. When that was the case, I had to call the Comcast office and have them restart our modem from their end. I did this anywhere from 2-7 times a week for three months.\r\n\r\nSince March 1st, I have called numerous times! I have called to have a technician come out and check the internet connection at least four times, I have called to have assistance restarting our modem 30+ times, I have gone in to exchange our modem twice, and I have even called to attempt to resolve our billing 6+ times. It took THREE MONTHS and EIGHT DAYS, for the Internet issues to even begin being resolved! I feel that I have been paying a company to lie to me in order to placate my anger while they do nothing to resolve the issues. Here is a short summary of my life with Comcast in the last three months:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Four Technicians came to the home and claimed they had \u201cfixed the problem.\u201d Within an hour, the Internet was once again broken. \r\n\u00b7 On the phone daily, employees promise that the issue is resolved. The Internet would crash within the hour. \r\n\u00b7 Told that wiring in the house may need to be fixed to resolve issue. Rewired home and problem persists. \r\n\u00b7 Told that Comcast wiring in the neighborhood is broken. Neighborhood technician fixes the problem and the problem continues. \r\n\u00b7 Went to the Comcast office to try two new modems. Problem unresolved and monthly bill is raised.\r\n\r\nI have noticed my service bill has gone up since April 1st. I do not understand nor do I want to pay since I have not received any services promised for March, April or May. When I call, I am told a supervisor is not in, they are on a trip, and they are too busy to answer my call. I called the billing department around May 28th and was promised that a supervisor would be calling me back no later than June 4th to resolve the issue. This never happened. I called back in an attempt to have the conversation I was promised and was told that my credits are on hold and a supervisor is not in at the moment to discuss it further. Many times I have been told that I will get a credit on my account but this is never given. It wasn't until I spoke with someone from the Loyalties department that I was finally helped with my billing. This was, however, after I threatened to cancel my service due to the employee demeaning and accusing me! I am unimpressed.", "Had my internet service mysteriously stop working a week ago while listening to Pandora. Think Comcast gives two craps about correcting problem as promised to a customer of many years- think again! I knew something was up many months ago when my internet kept going out & losing its IP address or default gateway constantly plus having modems replaced twice in barely a year. And I was always told it was \"interference in my own home\" & not any fault of theirs. Oh & also recently supposedly some interference in MY house was creating interference with \"other neighbors' service\" that required them to come in my house- but at last minute they decided wasn't necessary without further comment- maybe cause I made it clear I didn't wish to upgrade like they wanted. \r\n\r\nIt's all in the news now and all part of a game of greed on their part to use your home internet signals that YOU pay dearly for monthly to fuel their big project of \"providing alleged secure wifi hotspots\" that have been shown by experts to not be totally secure & unhackable. Glad I moved on to use another carrier & not wait for it to hit the fan & have my computer hacked. Comcast got too high & mighty for their pants & it will come back to bite them in the end & I will be laughing (with working service & much better customer service) when karma comes around!", "Not surprised to read here about all of the poor support one sees here. Going thru Comcast's WEB site, I see little or nothing in the way of useful help information. The business of doubling or quadrupling of monthly bills is shameful. I'd love to dump my local backwater cable internet service which keeps going thru the roof. They are the only game in town and are mostly reliable.

When I said that I'm not interested in Package Y, she made her voice louder and said that I should listen to what she says first before I talk. I found that to be very, very rude.\r\n\r\nI agreed to get Package Y (which was Internet + cable), but when the cable guy came, he said that the order did not indicate that we ordered for cable TV and Internet.  He was only prepared for Internet.  Clearly, there was a miscommunication.\r\n\r\nThe cable guy did not receive orders for a router, but we clearly indicated that we want a wireless connection. How can we use Wi-Fi without a router?  Monica ordered for a router.  We asked for the tracking number on Day A.  She was only able to give us the tracking number on Day B.  We tried to track our package but UPS said that they cannot track that particular number.\r\n\r\nI contacted Monica but she said that was the number that UPS gave.  Instead of helping us get the router (which was supposed to be delivered on August 31), she just gave us the customer service number.\r\n\r\nThe customer service people directed me to three different people before I was finally able to talk to a person. It took them 10 minutes.  The technical service person said that according to their records, UPS could not find our address and that the router was not delivered. I asked for a tracking number and that number was different from what Monica gave us.  We tried tracking it but the package is still not trackable.  The technical service person said that the router could possibly still be in the office but she's not sure.  I should call her again tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe LAN connection is also unpredictable. Sometimes, we couldn't get a good signal.  It has caused me and my housemates a great deal of inconvenience and we are appalled by the quality of service we are getting from Comcast.\r\n\r\nWe had to share one cable and take turns in using the computer when we are paying for Wi-Fi service.

I contacted Comcast today, 12/09/2011, to advise them that I received the past due notice and that I had made an electronic payment through my bank to them as of today, 12/09/2011.  I also mentioned to them that their billing practice is unreasonable.  They wait until the day of suspension to send you a past due notice.  As I stated to Comcast, you give the consumer no time to make a payment and you expect them to pay the day they receive the past due notice.  Now if I would have called last night, 12/08/2011, would they have given me an extension?  But I called today to let them know payment has been made.

Comcast is like the government. You don't have too many choices. They do whatever they want, and you can do nothing about it if you want cable service. I have no choice. They are very unprofessional. I am going to AT&amp;T. It has caused a lot of aggravation on my part, but they expect me to pay my bill, regardless the poor service they provide. </p>\n<p>We should all go for class action against Comcast. I hope someone will take the initiative.  I am also a victim of their business department. They made me wait for three weeks for the Internet service to be installed. I had to call them first, and they told me that they needed to do construction work to be able to provide the Internet service.

I had to do a system restore because of that. </p>\n<p>My Internet speed is even slower than it was and the cost is way over anyone's budget.

I found out I was only getting 6 MB download speed. I was pressured to pay the bill for the incorrect amount. Amanda at Comcast said she could not generate a new bill for me.

They had to replace my 2 DVR boxes at least 5 times each because they kept replacing them with used units that still had the previous customers recording settings and recorded shows. The hard drives kept freezing up and suddenly failed. I ended up having to contact the Comcast executive customer care department, who finally had a senior level tech from a different region come out to resolve the issues. I am now without issues for about 3 weeks.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is, if you continue to have issues with Comcast, contact your customer service department and have them forward you to the executive customer care department for your area.

A Jennifer called, told me that no matter what I say, the balance is due. I told her that my bill is different every month and I just signed up for 39.99 for cable and 19.99 for internet. And Comcast has never sent me a bill for the same amount. We got into a heated discussion. Told her I should turn my service off. Then hung up. That was at 12:30pm. By the time I got home at 1:15pm, my service was off from the box as well as the pole that I paid for in advance.\r\n\r\nThe tech had already been to my house, cut off service from the pole. Called them back. They told me that it would be a week before service is turn back on. If their rep can't understand that people get upset about things or bills she is in the wrong field, customer service. And will not get credit for the week. It will take for them to turn back on. Bottom line, I need to find an entertainment service that keep their word on how much your bill is going to be. Times are hard and every penny counts. You can't budget a bill that keeps changing every month. That's what the whole complaint was about. Comcast rep told me that she wasn't changing anything any ways. That's when I really got upset. I don't recommend anybody to have Comcast. They are the worst. Jacksonville needs to kick them out like they did AT&T.", "When our mobile home park stopped including Comcast Cable TV without space rent, we were forced by default to subscribe to Comcast's Service. I agreed to a trial month and paid $59 to view nothing but junk and tried to contact our local Comcast office on Figueroa and Lomita Blvd. I later found out the store had closed and sold to Time Warner. I was unable to get a hold of anyone at Comcast. I unplugged the black cable box and put it in my closet.\r\n\r\nMonths later I started getting mailings for Time Warner, some other cable company that was soliciting their services. I was not interested and threw what I thought was junk mail in the trash. Finally, out of curiosity, I opened one of the envelopes to find a telephone number to ask them to take me off their mailing list. That is when I saw that they were charging me hundreds of dollars for cable service that had been transferred from the old erroneous Comcast billing. I called and spoke with an agent who was able to zero out my account, with the exception of the $210 owed for the black cable box. She said I could return it in person at the Hermosa Beach Office on Valley Drive. So, I did.\r\n\r\nIt's been a few years now so I don't remember the dates. I honestly thought everything was going to be good to go, but as you will see. It is not. I gave the receptionist (one of three sassy black girls running the show which is an odd sight in a beach town like Hermosa). I gave her the black box and she turned her monitor so I could see the final balance of $210 disappear into a nice zero! Finally, I was stoked! Another black helper gave me what I thought was a receipt of the printer and I went on my merry way.\r\n\r\nI know it was a busy day and I didn't read the paper until months later when I got another bill from Time Warner. I opened it in great expectation to see the glorious zero balance and was shocked to see a $420 charge for the $210 [that was supposedly credited I had seen the screen] and now for an additional $210 [that they were saying was for the box that they claimed had never been returned?]\r\n\r\nWhat craziness is this? I immediately wrote an accurate and in depth letter to the main customer complaint office in El Segundo and followed up with a phone call with yet, another sassy black woman. She was unreasonable, rude, threatening and hostile insisting that I owed their company this money. This is wrong. I don't owe them a penny. They have put this false charge on my credit report and continually call one of my son's phone numbers and harass him. I want them to nullify any charge against me and to fire those cross-prejudiced war mongers who disguise themselves as customers service agents.", "In December 2010, I received a mailing from Comcast advertising high speed internet for $19.99 for 24 months. I contacted Comcast to sign up and was told I would need to pay extra for their router. I told them their mailing did not indicate that and that I had my own router. They said it had to be their router. I asked what kind they used that was so special. They put me on hold and then came back on line and asked what router I had. I told them I had Linksys and another brand (I can't remember the brand off hand). They said neither would work. I asked again what brand they use and was told she didn't know as that was a technical question.\r\n\r\nAfter being transferred around, I was finally told there was a list of routers on their website that would work with their service. I discovered buying a router on my own was much cheaper than renting from Comcast, thus I went and bought one of the routers on their list. The tech showed up to install my internet and left without even telling me. He said he was going outside to check the line and he must have left because the next thing I knew, I was getting a phone call from Comcast with an automated message asking me to rate my recent service. \r\n\r\nI looked outside and sure enough the service truck was gone. The tech never even checked to see if the internet worked. I also never received any paperwork. I stated as much in the review and rated accordingly. Since it was a substandard review, I was asked if I wanted a rep to contact me. I indicated yes. Someone called back and I explained the situation and that I didn't even get any paperwork or \"set up kit\" the survey had referred to. The rep apologized and stated they would mail everything to me. It's been a year and I never received it.\r\n\r\nThe first bill I received was for almost $100. I called and asked about it and was told it was for the service call and the first 2 months of service. I told them the bill should be around $40 as I was only paying $20 a month and there was free installation. I took about a month for them to resolve the issue and straighten my bill out. Thankfully, the following 11 months went by with no issues. In November, I bought a wireless printer and needed to hook it up to my wireless internet. I couldn't locate my WEP key so contacted Comcast asking for advice. After being transferred around, disconnected, transferred around again and then routed back to the original department I had called, I was told they could maybe help me, but it would cost $50. \r\n\r\nThe rep tried selling this service telling me how it used to be a $120 house call for this, but now they could remotely access my computer and usually gets the WEP key that way. Usually, I asked about that and was told that if they were unsuccessful, they would send someone out for the $120. Since they were only looking into my computer for the code, I asked if I couldn't just find it myself. The rep assured me there was no way I would be able to do this as it required a high level of technical training and computer knowledge as I would need to change and reset computer settings, etc. I asked again, but it's possible?\r\n\r\nThis argument continued for at least 5-10 minutes before the rep grudgingly and rather rudely admitted that yes, it was possible it could be done, but there was no way I, myself, would be able to do it. I told him it was worth a try and disconnected. The whole call from first initial dial to disconnect was 57 minutes; just to ask a question. I went on line and Googled how to recover misplaced WEP key. There were many, many places to look. The first site I went to recommended looking on the bottom of the router as often times it is written there. The second site I went to (specifically for my brand router) offered similar advice, stating all you need to do is log into your account- user name and password located on bottom of router. I turned my router upside down, located web address, user name and password, logged in, went to setting and found my WEP key. No technical skills, no computer knowledge, no problem. Time from first Google key stroke to locating WEP key- 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nJanuary 2, 2011. I went on line to pay my bill- due Jan 7. My bill shows I owe almost $50. This is strange since I have been paying roughly $22-23 a month for the last year. Knowing if I paid the full amount I would never get my money back, I contacted Comcast direct and discovered it was after 8pm and I would need to call again tomorrow. Jan. 3, I called back and spoke with Stacy. Initially, she told me the deal was for only 12 months. Not so, I told her. It was for 24 months and they were the ones that solicited my business. She put me on hold and came back and said she confirmed that my deal was $14.99 a month for 12 months with an additional $5 a month charge for router rental. I told her they owed me a refund then, because I own my own router.\r\n\r\nShe put me on hold again then returned and stated I was on the $19.99/month special for 6 months. I told her to check my billing history as I had been paying this amount for a year. Then she said it must have been a 12 month deal. I again told her it was a 24 month deal and I wouldn't pay my bill until they fixed it. She stated she would have to put in a ticket and would get back to me tomorrow (Wed) or Saturday. I never figured out the delay for that one. I never heard back on Wed or Sat. Nor Sun, Mon or Tues. I checked my bill and now it showed almost $100 as my bill was now late and they had added another month. I tried calling Tues night but, again, it was after 8pm and they were closed. I sent an email which guaranteed a response in 24 hrs. I explained that my bill was incorrect and needed to be fixed and that Stacy had promised to get back to me and never did.\r\n\r\nI did not get a reply to my email in 24 hrs, 48 hrs, or 72 hrs. Jan 12 I call Comcast again. I explain the billing problem and that no one is fixing it or getting back to me. I make the comment; I guess they don't want to get their money. I get transferred to the resolution center and speak to Kelly who is extremely apologetic and assure me she will resolve this problem. She comments she sees I spoke to Stacy who is actually a supervisor and awesome customer service. I told Kelly I may have agreed with her assessment of Stacy if Stacy had ever called me back like she promised. Kelly put me on hold to try and get in touch with Stacy. Kelly came back on the line and stated Stacy wasn't at her desk but that she would send an email to someone (unknown who) to get the matter resolved ASAP. Kelly assured me she would get back to me today no matter what. She said she couldn't make the person read their email, but she would for sure call me back and let me know what was going on, even if she was still waiting for a reply. That was Thurs, still waiting to hear back from Kelly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on Sat Jan 14, I receive a reply to my email from Sandi. Sandi says \"Rest assured that all information included in this correspondence will help resolve your billing issue.\" and then proceeds to tell me I will have to speak to a live representative to further look into my billing question.\r\n\r\nComcast will be getting a phone call on Monday, disconnecting my service. They have the worst customer service ever. They are truly about money only and do not care about the people shelling it out. As long as they monopolize the industry, this will never change. I will be changing to a small time local provider. I will be paying more each month, but it will be worth it to know it's just one more person not paying Comcast.\r\n", "I canceled Comcast Internet and was never told to what to do with their equipment. I have moved a lot and have dealt with several ISP companies. Every time I cancel, the company makes sure to tell me what to do with their equipment. I was in the middle of moving and over paid my bill. After the move, I notice that a refund had not been coming in the mail. \r\n\r\nI called Comcast to see about getting my refund and found that they had turned me into a collection agency for not returning their equipment. I tried telling them that I wasn't told to do anything with their equipment and had left it at the apartment. They said that it wasn't their fault and that it's not their job to instruct customers on what to do with the equipment. They said it was common sense to drop it off at a local Comcast store. \r\n\r\nI had never had Comcast before and the companies I did have usually sent me a box to send the equipment back to them when I canceled service or they came and picked it up. The customer service person was very rude, unprofessional and unwilling to accept any responsibly in this matter.\r\n", "I booked an appointment for just replacing a router recently. I was informed the charges would be $40 for it. I agreed, and the technician replaced it. But after a few days, I received my bill which charged me $60 for that appointment and replacement.

Informing something and charging something else. What if I miss to check the details of the bill? We will be robbed.", "When I moved into my current home, I went with Comcast over Verizon internet, because at the time, it was cheaper for a basic high-speed internet package. Within six months, they jacked the price up to about ten bucks a month cheaper than their total cable TV plus internet package. Oh well, I said, I'll stay. I've had no other problems so far, until last week. Out of nowhere, I began getting scare-ware popups, saying that I had DNS-changer malware on my computer, and to call Comcast immediately. Considering that my system runs on Linux, I was skeptical at best. I checked my DNS settings and IPs, everything was perfectly legit. I ran an anti-malware anyhow, to be thorough, and surprise! I found nothing.\r\n\r\nI then spent an hour on the phone, to speak to a girl, who tried her best to convince me that I did not know what I was doing, and tried to sell me Comcast's internet security package. When it became clear that I did, in fact, know precisely what I was doing, she bailed as fast as she could on the call, saying that a supervisor would look into it. Sure enough, within an hour, the pop-ups vanished. At least they did until this morning, when I began getting a different pop-up, this time saying that the malware is changing my computer settings. Really, guys? Really?\r\n\r\nI'm done with Comcast, thoroughly done. Stay away from Comcast, whatever you do!

Yesterday as of this date I spoke to a so-called customer service rep and asked why everything was down. I was told they changed security settings and reset everyone's account. I asked if they notified everyone and he said no. No! This is the stuff that makes Comcast service the worst, but unfortunately they are the 800-lb. gorilla on the block and you have no other choice but to go through them or else have no service in my area. And you watch they are still going to charge us for the downtime even though we did not get what we pay for. To date I still cannot get my emails though my mobile phone or have to keep entering my account information on my PC at home every time I want to check it. Unsatisfactory!

Reliable phone and internet service are critical for our patients. Comcast is responsible for our phones and internet and it is very unreliable!

It has been almost eight months and I still haven't received anything but the run around and several credits for poor customer service. There was a problem with the billing every month and every month I would ask about the Visa gift card, only to be told the coding wasn't done correctly or wasn\u2019t on the account at all. After being told month after month that the Visa gift card coding on the account hadn't been done correctly, a supervisor gave out someone\u2019s home phone number when I requested a contact number for Visa.

I called Comcast at least 6 times with no return call from any person. They are responsible for paying for the mess that they made and I want this to be resolved ASAP. I would never recommend Comcast to anyone as they are totally incompetent. I want my $98.70 that they owe me.", "I contacted you back in November or December 2011, with issues of overcharges by Comcast for services that were not provided. This has continued, despite numerous calls to Comcast to straighten it out. I downgraded my services, as well, and am still being charged.\r\n\r\nFirst, I have been charged every month for DVR service, since as far back as I can find bills (January 2011). I don't have DVR service, I don't have the equipment. Second, I am being charged for a top-tier of services, including multiple channels, which I do not have access to, and that includes the DVR, telephone (which has been disconnected completely) and high-speed internet. Third, I received the lowest level of cable TV and internet, and was quoted a monthly cost for both of less than $70 plus taxes and fees. My last two month's bills have both been over $140. Lastly, I have called, emailed, and \"chatted\" for approximately 20 hours since January about these issues, and nothing changed. Well, they did disconnect my phone but two weeks earlier than requested and they are still charging me for having the service.\r\n\r\nYou might ask why I continue with Comcast, it\u2019s because there are no other providers that I can obtain service with. I live in a high-rise apartment, and have been told by Dish, DirecTV and AT&T that since the management has a contract with these providers, the individual tenants cannot obtain individual service. The management does not provide any of these services, whether at cost or free, to any individual tenant, but it still prohibits other companies from making a contract with individuals. My only choice to receive TV and Internet is via Comcast. Thankfully, I've been able to get limited cell phone use and cancel Comcast phone to save some money.\r\n\r\nComcast now charges for any technical support, and debited my bank account without my permission for a down payment of \"Xfinity Support\" that has been credited back. However, the monthly charge for this technical support appears on the bills I receive as well. I thought this was taken care of, but depending on what day I look at my bill, the $39 charge is there some months, not there some months, but the bills are still too high for what I have purchased from Comcast. Why is it that cities smaller than Nashville have multiple cable providers, but Comcast/Intermedia/Viacom/ whatever they've been called, remains the sole cable provider in Nashville, TN. I thought there were laws keeping monopolies like this from happening. In any case, I'd appreciate it if you'd help me straighten out the bills from January 2012 forward to only show the service I have received. Thank you.\r\n", "I don't understand how the Comcast pricing methodology is not illegal! I am currently paying $230 a month for phone, cable and internet. In an attempt to reduce my monthly bills in these tough economic times, I reached out to Comcast and asked them how I could reduce my bill. They started out by offering to remove the package that included all of the movie channels (which I never watch) and save me almost $60 a month. Perfect! Sounds great, right? Not so fast.\r\n\r\nThey soon told me that I would lose the $30 a month package discount that I was receiving, that I would have to start paying for the DVR ($17 a month!) that was included in my current package, and that I would lose the NFL RedZone channel (literally the only channel that I actually watch) and it would cost me $6 a month to add it back. At the end of all the scams that they slapped on and called fees, the package was back to the same price! \r\n\r\nThey literally could not reduce my package to a place where I would actually see a decrease in my monthly bill. In response to my displeasure, the customer service rep suggested that I change my phone to local calling only if I wanted to save money. I think that this is an outrage and feel completely taken advantage of. There are no other options in my area as AT&T is not currently offering Uverse to my neighborhood. If I could, I would drop Comcast tomorrow and never look back.", "I had an appointment with Comcast to have our internet switched to their service last Wednesday. That appointment was changed to today, 4/9, as they had the home number listed incorrectly. Instead, they had my cell number as the number to which the internet was to be connected to. We called Comcast and got the correct phone number to them and we were rescheduled to have the internet connected between 7:30 and 8:30 this morning. Today, I sat and waited from 6:30AM to 8:30AM with no call from Comcast. When I called to ask what happened, they claim they were locked out of the gated community and they called my phone and no one answered.\r\n\r\nThis is a gated community, but my front door is directly on a street. There is no need to go into a gate to get to my apartment. You just need to go to the front door and knock. How hard is that? Also, they never called my cell phone as the tech claims and after reading all the comments of people who had bad experiences with Comcast, I read over and over where the techs called the home phone instead of the cell number that was left as a contact number. I have a home phone line, but not a home phone. We do not use our home phone line at all and that was explained to Comcast. \r\n\r\nAfter two bad experiences trying to get Comcast internet set up, I do believe this is a wake up call to not get Comcast internet! Comcast mixed up our phone numbers, our information, twice. I will not give them a third chance. If there is this much trouble trying to get their internet service, then I will take it as a sign not to go any further with this mess. Comcast seems to be too big for its britches. The commercials that Comcast has on TV about their excellent customer experience are just empty words.\r\n", "Unauthorized credit check - All I did was go to Comcast's website to check out prices for their internet service. They required my address so I entered that information. Today (04/16/2012), I received a letter from Comcast informing me they had made a credit inquiry on me. I know that numerous inquiries can hurt your credit and I never authorized or requested this. I am outraged that Comcast would do something so sensitive without permission. I now know that I will never trust this company and will never use them. How can I undo this credit check? I feel so violated and helpless.\r\n", "Overcharged me and cut my service off - They cannot explain why they are charging me $256.00 and wants $170.00 before they will turn my cable back on. I have bank statements dated back November of 2011 showing all the payments that I\u2019ve made and that I am paid up until May 22nd, 2012.", "My Comcast nightmare began in June 2011 and still continues. On 7/19/11 at 4:10 AM, I had no internet or phone service. I telephoned Comcast and the automated system indicated an appointment was scheduled this day, between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. However, James indicated I would be scheduled for a tech visit between 11:00AM and 2:00 PM.\r\n\r\nAfter a no show, I telephoned Comcast at 2:05 PM, spoke with Tony and requested to speak with a supervisor. Shortly thereafter, a woman identifying herself as a supervisor answered and conveyed she would try to schedule a tech appointment as soon as possible because James did not place an order for today. She stated she would call back to alert me of the appointment and I gave my cell number because my home phone was not in service. At 3:35 PM, I called Comcast again after hearing nothing from the supervisor. The automated system indicated that I was scheduled for a tech visit on 7/20/11 between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM.\r\n\r\nI noticed that on 7/20/11 at 3:10 AM, I had no internet or phone service, thus my security system was also disabled. At 11:15 AM, the internet and phone service is back on mysteriously. At 11:42 AM, a Comcast tech arrived and indicated he reconfigured a wire outside and everything is working now. At 12:02 PM, the tech left. At 1:06 PM, the internet and telephone went out again! At 1:15 PM, I telephoned Comcast and spoke with Ilka, who promised to contact the tech and ask that he return to check out the problem. At 1:32 PM, the internet and phone are back on. I received no further contact from Comcast and at 10:45 PM, the internet and telephone went out again. The nightmare continues!\r\n\r\nOn 7/21/11 at 4:55 AM there was no internet or telephone service. At 7:18 AM, the internet and telephone is back on. This is unbelievably egregious!\r\n\r\nOn 7/22/11 at 3:20 AM, no internet or telephone service, thus no security services. At 5:44 AM, the telephone and internet is back on.\r\n\r\nOn 7/23/11 at 6:05 AM, no internet or telephone service, thus no security service. At 9:17 AM, the internet and telephone is back on.\r\n\r\nOn 8/1/11, I received a telephone call from Brian Roberts, Comcast CEO, who I had written to on July 18. He apologized for the inconvenience and agreed to reimburse/offer discount and conveyed that my next bill will be $113.\r\nOn 8/10/11, I received a bill from Comcast, reflecting a bill for $129.41. Clearly not the amount quoted by Mr. Roberts via telephone contact on 8/1/11. This is getting pretty ridiculous, so I forwarded payment on 8/26/11 in the amount of $129.41. These fees supposedly cover the period of 8/17/11 to 9/16/11.\r\n\r\nOne of most infuriating things that these greedy people did was they charged me $15.25 for a relocate outlet, which did not occur. The tech simply erected a plate around the wire during the site visit on 7/18/11, because he said the plate should have been erected during the initial installation in 2004.\r\n\r\nOn 8/27/11, hurricane Irene hit the Richmond area and the power went out at 1:55 PM. Understandably there was no internet or cable service, but I had no telephone service either. Of course, no one at Comcast mentioned that power outages seriously affected their Comcast land line services.\r\n\r\nOn 8/31/11, the power was restored by Dominion at 4:05 PM. The internet, phone & cable were working properly. At 7:11 PM, there was no internet or telephone service, which essentially cut off access to ADT Security Services. By the way, the automated system indicated that Comcast received $129.41 payment on 8/30/11.\r\n\r\nOn 9/1/11 at 5:49 AM, the internet and telephone services are back on and off again at 6:21 AM. At 10:40 AM, the internet and telephone services are back on. In retrospect, I telephoned Comcast at 7:16 AM to report the problems, received an automated message that conveyed the service area was experiencing disruptions and the services would be restored soon.\r\n\r\nOn 9/3/11 at 10:49 AM, there was no internet or telephone service. I telephoned Comcast to report the problems and, of course, you can only report one issue at a time. I got the automated system and it conveyed that they had received numerous requests and the wait time will be 10 minutes. The system gave the option of holding on for 10 minutes or calling back. In the meantime, I tried to call in the no telephone service issue and received a busy signal 5 times. Finally, at 11:51 AM, the internet & telephone are back on. This nightmare does not end!\r\n\r\nOn 9/4//11 at 4:10 AM, there was no internet or telephone service. I telephoned Comcast at 6:16 AM, spoke with a gentleman and, while talking at 6:18 AM, the internet and telephone came back on. It is so frustrating to have to pay for such an unstable service. It is obvious that Comcast simply does not care if services are satisfactory or not.\r\n\r\nOn 9/5/11 at 4:16 AM, there was no internet or telephone service. I telephoned Comcast at 4:40 AM, moved through the prompts and the automated system hung up. I called back at 5:49 AM and spoke to a gentleman who could barely speak English. I had to repeat my home telephone number three times and he asked me to repeat the issues three times. He reportedly tried to send a signal twice, to no avail. He then asked, \u201cDid you hook up the system yourself or did someone from Comcast?\u201d I could not believe he asked what I thought I heard and he repeated the above. He then said he would send out a technician and I asked, \u201cSo the time will probably be between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM?\u201d and he conveys, \u201cProbably.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult and frustrating to understand this man, who fumbled through every aspect of this reporting process. In order to avoid further frustration, I conveyed that I would call back later. Hopefully, the next call will afford me the pleasure of conversing with someone who speaks and understands English, in addition to being competent. This is totally absurd!\r\n\r\nOn 9/5/11 at 8:45 AM, still no internet or telephone service. I finally reached an English speaking Comcast representative named Mike. He reportedly attempted to send a signal to no avail. He conveyed that he set up an onsite tech visit for 9/7/11, between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM, confirmation #CR260880542. At 10:15 AM, the internet and telephone are back up. I called Comcast, received the automated system and I cancelled the work order for 9/7/11.\r\n\r\nOn 9/5/11 at 3:00 PM, I could not access my AOL email account, MSN or Facebook. There was a reading on screen indicating, \u201cInfinity, please conduct self-installation for new services.\u201d This was very alarming because I had not activated any new services. At 3:01 PM, I called Comcast and spoke with Matt, who conveyed that I was mistakenly taken off the Comcast server. Matt patiently walked me through the process and all of my connection services were restored.\r\n\r\nOn 9/6/11 at 7:50 AM, the internet and telephone went out. At 10:53 AM, I telephoned Comcast and spoke with Richard, who conveyed that their system indicated that I had no signal. He said he would discuss this matter with a manager and would call back as soon as possible on my cell.\r\n\r\nAt 12:16 PM, the internet and telephone services were restored. At 12:36PM, I received a call from Comcast automated system that our area had experienced problems and a site visit was set up for 9/8/11, between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM.\r\n\r\nI am finally convinced that there is nothing else to do, but seek services elsewhere.\r\n", "We have had Comcast since October of 2010.  However, for the first month, our internet did not work.  And it was turned off in December for copyright infringement.  The installer did not set up security on our modem.  Because someone hacked into our system, we got no signal from the beginning of October through November.  We were reimbursed for this month by Comcast.  Then, we received a call stating we were under copyright violation as they noted several French movies downloaded!  We don't even speak French and had not been able to get online!  After calling the tech support and their inadequate third party security company, it was discovered that our system was hacked and a security code was placed on the modem.  It was easy enough. \r\n\r\nIn September of this year (2011), we received a phone call stating we had gone over our bandwidth, and again we were facing a copyright infringement.  What they did not know was our modem had been struck by lightning in March of 2011, and was deemed \"nonworking\".  Yet, no one came out to exchange it.  We were able to get online just slowly.  But as we had had a son with health issues, honestly the internet connection was the last thing on our minds at the time.  However, according to Comcast, we downloaded 2T of information from August 1 to the 31st.  It is way impossible.  Those IT and tech geeks out there know how much information that is, as well as how hard that would be, considering we had little to no connection! \r\n\r\nI called their security department again.  I told them there was no way we did this.  He suggested we change our security information again.  It appeared, with all of the usage, that more than one computer was involved.  So, we did.  Now, we have been served a subpoena regarding a copy right infringement from AF Holdings that supposedly happened on April 9, 2011.  It does not state what content was supposedly downloaded.  As a consumer and a defendant, this information is supposed to be made available to me.  I have the right to know what I am being accused of and the details of that accusation.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, as stated earlier in this complaint, our modem was struck by lightning and we had virtually no connection.  According to the security department, they cannot prove or disprove our system was hacked, only that our IP was used to do it.  Well, I may not be the sharpest tech tool in the shed.  But shouldn't Comcast, if they are going to incorporate these security measures, at least have the technology to see if the information is being routed to another computer.  I feel that since they cannot \"prove or disprove\" hacking, they have no right to cause this stress on its customers that pay more than they should for internet.  \r\n\r\nI will be filing a formal complaint with the FTC and the BBB.  I will also contact a good attorney that may want to make a name for themselves and try to incorporate a class action suit against Comcast.  It is for falsely claiming to provide security and falsely accusing its customers of illegal practices without adequate proof to back that up.  For the record, prior to Comcast service, we had AT&T.  They were able to show us on 3 different occasions that our internet was being hacked and give the name of the modem using our connection!", "I have Comcast Xfinity and regularly get low upload speeds (2 mbps) making Skype impossible. Recently, my services have been going down all together. One time Comcast will tell me it's my router, so I bought a new router, then the next week it's my modem, the next we're back to the router. After a long discussion, Comcast finally agreed that maybe the problem could be on Comcast's end and agreed to send a repair truck. \r\n\r\nToday, I got a call confirming my appointment. Then I was told to hold for an agent. For 10 minutes, I was on hold waiting for who knows what. I hung up as that's just abusive on top of all of the abuse. I have already taken with the lines about the problem being my fault. So I went to the online chat. Someone named Zion had no idea what I had been called for other than to confirm the appointment or what further information Comcast could possibly need. Unless I get an explanation, that is just harassment and Zion certainly couldn't provide one. I just want internet service I don't have to fight for. I realize that I live in an infrastructure challenged environment, but would like a deep discount if the service is going to be so poor.\r\n", "Comcast is an absolute disaster! We ordered an HDMI box for a new system we were having installed. The technician came to our home and was completely out of it. I should have asked him to leave. He installed the incorrect box and did not record the number of the box he removed which resulted in another TV in our home to lose service. In calling Comcast to replace the box, I was told that it wouldn't take place today when we have all the TV installers here. They were unable to solve the problem, took no responsibility and quite frankly, it was lousy customer service. We will be looking to move our service to a competitor.", "I have had 4 Comcast technicians come to my home. They say the problem is not my computer or wiring to the house. One Tech said they would \"monitor\" my house to see what was wrong and get back with me, they never did. I get such slow speeds that I cannot even open and send email. I had a speed tester set on my favorites and I get signals ranging from 2 to 65 and a ping of 56. They say the trouble is \"down the line\". What they mean is they oversold the service in my area and do not have the bandwidth to support all the customers.", "They doubled the rates so we canceled. More than a week later, we got a message on the answering machine from a recording stating we had to have the box back by 10/13/11 and an address to return it to. Couldn't find the address, couldn't get a live person at Comcast. Finally got it back 10/14/11. Told them of the problems. No one ever said it has to be back by X date or there will be a late fee! Then we get a bill, we called them \"since you kept it so long there is a late fee\" Now it's gone to a collection agency who calls with a recording telling me to call them. This company has had the worst customer service on the planet, and the price changes every 5 minutes.", "<p>I signed up for a promotion around May 2011 for Xfinity's internet and my wife and I were so excited, only to find out that our internet was not working and we had to wait about 2 days later for the technician to come out and repair the modem. The technician arrived at noon on May 29, that was our anniversary. We were going to a family gathering but missed most of it because the technician was working on our modem for over 8 hours! It was late in the evening, half our day gone, and my wife and I didn't even get an explanation on why. </p>\n<p>Next, I got my first bill around late June for the amount of $283.89!! I glanced down; I had a past due balance! Naturally, I was upset and wanted to know what was going on! So I called the first agent, he was apologetic. It was an error on their part and I was receiving the wrong service. I was supposed to get 12 mbs but instead was getting 20 and I was charged $99.99 for installation! </p>\n<p>After he assured me that it was going to be taken care of, I requested them to send me a paper bill with the correction so I can pay my correct balance. No bill came and my service was cut off about a week later! Now, I was furious and called for the second time only to repeat everything I went through with the first customer agent. I asked about the notes that the prior agent left regarding our last conversation. The agent told me if I paid $26.99 today and that my credit will kick in this cycle but they needed immediate payment. So, I paid and we got the service again. No bill came yet, and I called so it doesn't seem like I'm getting the internet for free. Again, this agent explained that my credit will take care of the cycle due to reimbursement of over $100.00. I asked how much balance is due. He said for next month, I believe $59.99, not including taxes.</p>\n", "My representative payee paid my bill when it was due on November 26,2011 for $140.56. The bill receipt online says 0.00 balance. Then they bill me for $291.00 and my rep payee pays it. Now it says online zero balance again and that I paid $326.00. My bill per month has gone from $104 in Sept. I was supposed to be paying for a year but instead I'm paying $140.00 then I'm required to pay $186.00. I'm still getting the basic plan. How can Comcast get away with stealing from disabled America citizens!", "My Internet service suffers from: shaping, speeds are shaped based on usage type; throttling, speeds are throttled per usage hours; monitoring, everywhere you browse, everything you download, everything you upload is logged on their servers; false advertising, speeds on the package and in speed tests come up the same and higher than what they\u2019ve listed for (I am now 18 Mbps down), but actual download speed when downloading anything is 1-2 Mbps.\r\n\r\nFCC has nailed them repeatedly on these and no change has happened. Random outrages that they don't even claim exist when you call them and insist on sending a technician out to check your system only to have the service back up in a few minutes or hours. A little insult here, I actually got to talk to a regional lead service technician and found out the \"barn\" doesn't even know when a field technician is working on a line and service is out, so their left hand doesn't know what their right hand is doing.\r\n", "Comcast has once again screwed me! I spent several times this year having to call and get my payments corrected. The last person I talked to assured me the package she gave me was good until 2013 at $159.00 per month, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s $189.00 and soon it will be $220.00.\r\n\r\nComcast people are the worst I have ever dealt with and they lie like **. They just want your money and do not care how much stress they put on the consumer! I have been a customer for 8 years, and as time go by, more and more lies. I want to talk to the president of this company. I am fed up with their **. I am on limited income and they lie constantly. Please tell me the name of someone who gives a ** that I can talk to.\r\n", "I am planning on moving out of state in August. Since Comcast will not allow me to transfer service or provide me any way to keep my email account open through the transition period, I will loose my email account and any saved emails and addresses. They have no provision for transition at all. At the very least, this practice should be disclosed when they sell you their service or they should be customer service oriented enough to make transition provisions, even at a reasonable monthly charge.\r\n\r\nWhen I move and probably before then, I will get rid of Comcast and I may discontinue cable altogether before I call them to be my internet and cable provider. I have started moving all my email to Gmail and changing my email addresses as of today. I am through with being bullied by the likes of Comcast.", "The first tech came out and didn't know how to install the phone lines and left us with no phone. The phone line is connected to the security system. For over a week we had no phone and no security system. Tech charged us for services he didn't perform. Cable box had to be replaced within the first month. We were told 2 times that they were sending us a new box but never received them; however, we were charged the shipping fee for both boxes. We had to call multiple times to get help and were on hold and transferred around several times each time.\r\n", "In December of 2011, I made the decision to move up to broadband from dial up. The Comcast install rep installed things and once up, he commented on how slow my computer was, suggesting that I disable certain functions on my computer to improve speed. I did not do this, as I didn't have enough knowledge of what each function did to mess around with that.\r\n\r\nAfter using the new service for a bit, I went to Comcast's website and noticed they had a download available, which said \"optimize your computer for Comcast\" or something to that effect. I'm very cautious about downloading anything, so I called Comcast twice to verify that the site was indeed theirs and asked if it was safe to download. Both reps said yes, with the second one verifying the web address I provided was Comcast's.\r\n\r\nLater that night, I was no longer able to connect to the internet. I noticed certain programs were missing. Slowly, everything on my computer was wiped out. Fortunately, I had backed up my files, but now my computer is useless. I tried reinstalling after a long search to find the product key, but none of the drivers work, except for the CD. Modems aren't recognized. All the programs I had are gone. As stated, I was very cautious about downloading things. I had only had my computer crash once before and that was when I first got it and started using the internet. The first day I got broadband from Comcast, I got a virus from the download on their site and my computer crashed.\r\n\r\nI called Comcast and requested to speak to a local supervisor. I spoke with Patti and she herself stated that it was definitely the link on their site that caused my computer to crash. She said she was going to look into some things. I called her again and she said it was being processed as a damage claim and that I should call her back by about mid January 2012 if I didn't hear from her. \r\n\r\nI didn't hear from her and called her back, only to get her voice mail. I called a few more times, getting her voice mail every time, and let her know I would be suing the company if I didn't receive compensation for my computer. I have not been able to pursue this due to lack of enough money to file a case in civil court.\r\n\r\nUp until today, March 23rd, my mother had not received her monthly bills. We assumed this was how Comcast was reimbursing me for my computer. We found out differently. There came a bill in the amount of $400. My mother called the regular Comcast line and explained the situation. She asked if they could allow her to pay the bill in increments until she could get caught up. They refused and said if she didn't pay they were going to cancel service. Someone from Comcast kept calling about the bill. I called and told the rep I spoke to, not to call anymore or we would sue for harassment, explaining that this was already discussed with another rep. She continued to argue with me, even when I told her about the do not call law.\r\n\r\nI called Patti, the supervisor I had spoken with, and told her again that I would take Comcast to court for the damage to my computer and told her (again, via voice mail) about the situation with the billing issues. I explained that my mother had been a customer for 30 years and how despicable it was, that both she and I had to deal with this. I'm not holding my breath waiting for her to call, much less resolve this. I have these conversations recorded and explained to Patti when I spoke with her in December, that I was recording any conversations I had with the company. ", "I have been a Comcast customer for several years. In February, I placed an order to move my service to my new house. The new service was activated on Saturday, March 3. I had several issues with my cable, but they have now been resolved. I continue to have issues with internet, more specifically, my Comcast email. When the new service was activated, the Comcast installer did not bring a router. We could not get wireless to work with the Comcast router that I brought with me from my previous residence. I was instructed to call Comcast to order a router, which I did. It arrived about 4 days later and I activated it according to the directions. Everything was fine for a couple of days. Then my email no longer worked. It did not work at my home, it did not work on my Blackberry and it did not work when I took my laptop with me to Starbucks, etc. \r\n\r\nI called Comcast only to discover that they had shut my email addresses down. Apparently, the move order did not include (although I made a point of requesting) the transfer of my email addresses and they had been cancelled. During this call, I was assured they could turn my emails back on and that it would take about 48 hours. True to their word, I had email again in approximately 48 hours. But about 24 hours later, problems started. This was on or about Thursday, March 15. I could log in to my Comcast email account, but when I attempted to open any of my emails, I got an error message stating that the webpage could not be displayed. I tried my second laptop and the same thing happened. I called Comcast and was informed that I had problems with my laptop and was instructed to follow directions to reset my browser and other things specific to my laptop. It did not help on either of my laptops. \r\n\r\nMy first call about this problem ended with no resolution. I decided the next day to take my laptop to Starbucks. I was able to log in and open all of my emails at Starbucks, so I called Comcast when I returned home. Now on March 17, to explain that the problem probably was not my laptop since I did not have the problem except at my residence, it was then suggested that I needed a new (another new router since the ones I was using was only a few days old) router/modem. It was shipped via expedited shipping and it arrived on Wednesday, March 21. Once again, I installed and activated the new modem/router and even with the new router, I continued to have the same problem. I called Comcast and was eventually told that a ticket had been issued to bump up my case to national (?), another level of customer service, and that I would get a call within 24 hours. \r\n\r\nI did not get the call and so tonight, Friday, March 23, I called Comcast again. I was told, after being instructed to reset my browser, which I opted not to do because I do not trust Comcast to fix anything and do not feel good about following any instructions that mess with my equipment, that the case follow-up phone call did not have a deadline until Saturday, March 24. I opted to end my call to Comcast at that time and waited for the call on Saturday, March 24. I am beyond frustrated over the problem and Comcast's inability to fix my problem. When you look at the entire process of the activation of my service since March 3, it has been an absolute disaster.", "I started service with the GA Comcast service in Lawrenceville. I bought my own modem from Fry's Electronics before starting service with them. All was fine with service, billing - everything at that address. I moved to Cumming, GA and that was when things went bad. First of all, the account rep put on my service order that I needed a modem after telling her several times I owned one. When the tech arrived to set up my service, he saw that I already had a modem and had it properly notated on my account, so I was not charged for it the first month (April 2011) at my current address. I made the mistake of trusting it was off the rest of the time. When my bill went up after 6 months of promo time, I logged in and looked at my bill finding the modem lease fee on my bill. I called and was told they had to escalate it and would take 2-3 weeks to get resolved. \r\n\r\nAfter no response for 2 months, I called back in and was told it was not resolved yet. However, it should be soon and I was welcome to stop paying for the modem as it would be credited back to my account. After 3 more months of this, I called in again. This time, I got a competent CSR who made the corrections. However, when they reactivated my service properly, somehow they entered my modem as a rental. I had to take my modem to my local office with proof of purchase to prove it was a retail, not theirs. The ladies at the office were quite helpful and put the proper notation in my account. I was told I had to call back in to corporate to have them correct the billing and listing. \r\n\r\nI did that, however, the CSR said she didn't have the authority and a supervisor would have to fix it. It got corrected without contacting me. I called back in 2 days later to find this out, but the credit for the nearly year of paying has not been taken care of. I was again told a manager had to do this and would call me within 3 business days. I told them I would register a complaint if no call within that time. Obviously, not taken care of.", "I originally cancelled my Comcast service about 1.5 years ago. I cancelled due to their anti competitive practice of allowing 250 gigs of traffic, which is mainly meant to slow down Netflix adoption; so at that point, I decided to vote with my money. I moved to Uverse whom soon after activated the same limits as Comcast. After having billing issues with AT&T, I moved in with my grandfather and I decided to give Comcast another try. \r\n\r\nOn Monday 04-02-11, I called to add internet to my grandfather's account. I confirmed details such as the name on the account, account number and address. The service was added without a problem and I was told to call back in one hour to activate the service. I called back on Tuesday 4-3-12 to add the MAC address and activate the service. I spoke to the tech department and provided the MAC address to the rep (the modem started to work immediately). The rep then requested the social security number of the account holder. I explained that the service had been added on Monday and that this information was not requested at that time. I voiced my opinion and stated that whatever information was needed to add a service should have been asked for at the time that the service was added. I informed him that the account holder was unavailable at the time due to the fact that he was sleeping at this time (9:30 pm). \r\n\r\nThe rep insisted on the information. I decided to go speak to my grandfather and provided the last four numbers requested. The rep then requested to speak to my grandfather. I explained to the rep that my grandfather is not a native English speaker. I also explained to the rep that if he wanted to speak to the account holder, he should have said so from the beginning. I asked him to not give me the runaround. I mentioned that it is bad service to the customer to not process things in a clear order. He should have clearly mentioned that he needed to speak to my grandfather from the beginning if that's what he needed. I mentioned again that my grandfather did not speak English. The rep said that there was a Spanish line and that I would need to call there. He did not offer to give me the number or transfer me. He then mentioned that as long as he can hear my grandfather giving me the information in the background that it would be fine. \r\n\r\nBy this time, I had mentioned various times that the modem was actually working and that if they were so concerned with security that they should turn the service off. I spoke to the supervisor of the associate that was helping me. I restated everything that had happened but she was equally unhelpful. I also mentioned to her that the service was actually working and that I just wanted the billing issue resolved. I asked if I could give the correct social security number and she said that I'd have to go into a Comcast office. I insisted that the issue be resolved immediately. I asked to speak to somebody who could do something and she mentioned that she was the only one on the floor. I asked to be transferred somewhere where I could be helped and the supervisor said okay. I asked for clarification as to where she would transfer me and she said that she did not have any control where I would end up. She stated that she would just transfer me to another call center and that she did not know who I would speak to or if they would be able to help me. I gave up on the situation for that night.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, I woke up and found that the service was working. During my lunch break at work, I called corporate and informed them of everything that had happened. I did not give the social at that point (my failure), but they mentioned that we would need to go in person to a Comcast payment center to correct the problem. They also mentioned that they would address the training issue so that their representative request the information they need in an order that makes sense. They also confirmed that I would need to go to a Comcast payment center to correct this. \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday afternoon, I spoke to my grandfather who informed me that he spoke to the Comcast Spanish line and they had mentioned that all was in order. They mentioned that the social security was correct and they even committed the sports package that I had added on Monday for him. I feel that we have been racially profiled our native language. I also feel that having my grandfather speaking in the background to someone who admitted to not understanding Spanish may have been ill motivated. I come to this conclusion due to the experience in the Spanish call center where the issue was addressed (temporarily). On Thursday morning, I woke up to no internet connection.", "I called to set up new service to the above address. We are moving in from out of state. I give the lady I talked to all the info she needed. She runs my credit check and tells me I have a $50 deposit. After I pay it, she takes the $50 out of my account. She says, \u201cOh, we don't offer service at that address.\u201d They did not give me a refund and told me to call my bank and dispute the charge. This is not right, they stole my money.\r\n\r\n", "Gary **, a Comcast technician did repair a computer connection that provided me with good service. However, without telling me, he did disconnect a wireless modem leaving me with no service in another area. After two conversations with a Comcast operator by phone, I got no satisfaction. I was told to contact Netflix to make repairs, which I did. The initial inspection cost me $150 and he had to purchase and install a more advanced modem, adding another $250 to the bill. Thus, the total situation cost me $400. Since your technician created the problem, and did not tell me about it, I think a billing adjustment by Comcast is appropriate. \r\n", "Starting almost 3 years back, I got extorted by Comcast, Medford housing scum dogs that stole rent & millions in Fed money helped monopolize Comcast, hiring many employees to keep shutting down & hacking our cable & computers. The FBI is investigating & I can't wait for the scum bags that overcharged, bribed & extorted me with help of city officials & yes, the investigators know. I'm hoping they're waiting to burn those thieves, greedy ** who robbed me & my son's mother after passing. A month later, they started. So I am owed not your filthy money, you owe me awe & I will get it.", "We pay for Comcast's fast internet and expect and usually get upload speeds around 5Mbps and download speeds around 15Mbps or faster. But for days at a time using speedtest.net, we can document that download speeds are throttled back to less than 3Mbps while the upload speeds never change. I haven't changed anything on my side, and my home network computer speeds remain the same. I have over 30 years as a computer user and programmer, down to the bit level, and I am not unfamiliar with setting up and running networks. \r\n\r\nOf course, when you call or email Comcast, they suggest it's your fault - clear your browser history and cache, you have a virus, your router's not working right, on and on - all of which can be easily disproved. So, I have to think they are either dumb or purposefully dishonest, maybe both. Comcast's 'solution' is to keep doing the same things over and over (e.g., sending a technician out to my home when the problem is clearly outside my home) but without ever solving the problems. Unfortunately, we have no competition except relatively slow DSL via the phone lines, and the lines here are so noisy that it won't support DSL half the time. How I wish we could have some real competition among ISPs. All I can do is continue to squawk at Comcast and hope it irritates them enough that they actually try to fix the problems.", "The actual download speeds to our house at **, Somerville, MA are consistently around 2.5 mbps as measured by the FCC's speed test. Comcast's speed test consistently returns a download speed of 12 mbps. The FCC's numbers confer the dead in the water download speeds we experience. You are not delivering anything close to rates your plans are sold at. I'm tired of complaining and will be starting two class action suits against Comcast if you don't start delivering on your commitments and stop falsifying your speed test results.\r\n", "Tech Support has been telling me that the problem is with my hardware, browser or settings. I explained to them that it doesn't matter whether I use my work laptop while I'm working or desktop at home or an iPad. The computers have different browsers. All cookies and cache have been cleared, so those excuses are invalid as are all the other ones they keep telling me. I explained that co-workers and people outside of my company are all having the same problem with their Comcast email but this info doesn't seem to make any difference.", "We have Comcast internet service. Recently we have been having problems with the internet service not working, so after calling tech support, it was decided a technician needed to make a house call. He came in and replaced the modem with a newer version - the internet worked. Within a couple of days, we had the same problem. Another technician came out and yet a newer version of the modem was connected. However, the technician left stating he still wasn't sure it would fix our problem as he didn't really know what was wrong with our system.\r\n\r\nAdding insult to injury, when we received our bill a $30 service fee was added for the house call. My husband said he absolutely wouldn't pay it. I have a friend who had just gone through this same scenario and she too was charged the service fee (but then changed over to another internet carrier). I couldn't help but wonder if it isn't some scam on Comcast's part to clip people for service fees. I know too many people who have had the same problem.\r\n", "After years without issue, this February, Comcast/Xfinity has entirely removed their data usage meter without informing customers.

TV cable for basic premium was promised to never exceed $29.95 per month as long as I maintained continuous service: second big lie! \r\n\r\nBasic math: $40 + $30 = $70 plus tax and fees another $15 max for a total of $85!

You will talk to a corporate  problem resolutionist only or you will get a liar from a district call center like Nashville! No 215 area code on Caller ID state. I asked for someone from corporate only and I damn well better be called by one in 30 minutes or I will exercise all legal venues and if pushed to do it! The one and only legal venue is not the FCC!\r\n\r\nThey are your State Attorney General\u2019s Office (Elliot ** ate AT&T up for millions of dollar for what Comcast is Doing), the US FTC or US Federal Trade Commission (They got AT&T too!), and the US FCC or US Federal Communication Commission (and keep verbally complaining because even though AT&T was sanctioned by them also, they are, simply put, slow to act!

Their prices are completely inflated and since they have a monopoly, it pretty much seems they can get away with whatever they want. This is highway robbery.

They then passed me onto service level 2, who inform me that for a mere $80 they'd help me solve the problem. I protest that the problem began with their new equipment, and that charging me $80 for making it work as advertised is tantamount to charging me $80 for my \"free\" new modem. They refused to engage with this argument, and insisted that I could either pay the $80 or attempt to have level 1 service (free) fix the problem.

Yes, we'll see if resetting the modem will help. If you're using the Comcast internet connection, we might get cut off but we'll reconnect after it's done. And also, may I ask for a reliable contact number in advance, just in case this needs to be escalated.\r\nAriane: I have no other number or reliable contact number. He is in the intensive care unit of a hospital. Please fix this.\r\nArlan: Okay. Resetting the modem now. Ariane, upon resetting the modem, system gave me a prompt that services are interrupted because of a past due. I need to open up your account in order for me to check how much is it. To safeguard your account, kindly provide the following information stated on the account, First and Last Name and last 4 digits of the SSN.\r\nAriane: Ariane ** xxxx - there is no past due. My monies were applied to the wrong account by Comcast. This was taken care of. Are you still there?\r\nArlan: Yes, sorry, I thought I already blasted my reply. I need to check on the account about that.\r\nAriane: Please do. I am furious right now. I need my phone service restored immediately or I will be contacting an attorney later this day. I have had just about enough. I am not mad at you. I realize you are trying to assist me, but this has been an ongoing issue since October. My boyfriend is in the hospital in critical condition, I need this phone service restored.\r\nArlan: Thank you for waiting Ariane, the only credit I see here on the account is $35. That's what I got so far, I'm going to look further in to the account.\r\nAriane: The address the money was applied to is ** avenue, ** Florida.\r\nArlan: May I know if that was your previous address?\r\nAriane: Yes. I transferred my service to the new address. I turned in my prior modem (have receipt). I paid my bill twice, but the money was applied to the old address.\r\nArlan: Yes, I do see here the note about the misapplied payment.\r\nAriane: I need my phone service restored immediately. I am really not kidding about speaking to an attorney later today. My boyfriend is in the hospital ICU and in critical condition!\r\nArlan: May I know if you still remember the amount that was mistakenly applied? I see here $39.99\r\nAriane: $106 plus dollars.I have my bank statement to prove same.\r\nArlan: I understand the situation Ariane. I know how it feels to be in your shoes, but I also need to follow company procedures in my end. I can't cancel the order unless we get a valid reason that can be justified through the notes.\r\nAriane: Shall I send you a screen shot of my bank statement? Will that be proof and justification enough? Please, I am not angry with you, but none of this billing problem, misapplied funds, is my fault, and when I really need Comcast to be reliable, they are not.\r\nArlan: May I ask for for the old address' zip code please Ariane? I'd like to check on the old account as well. As far as I can see , the only amount credited was the $35.\r\nAriane: No, you really do not know. The man I love might have died last night and I have no way of knowing. Old zip code 34953. Ticket number **. Comcast research number 417606 - comcast box - seth wpb/call center, ID ** ticket call back - ** - credit/115 pending, see if transfer done; 70 pending for box. Are you still there? Please, I am on the verge of panic, hysterics. I need to contact the hospital to see how my boyfriend is doing, if he survived the night.\r\nArlan: Thank you for waiting Ariane, I believe they are still investigating the payment transfer case. What I can do here is create an e-service ticket . Someone from e-service will make a follow up regarding the transfer of funds. They would contact you after 2 hours. I understand you do not have any other reliable contact number. An email can be used as means of communication.\r\nAriane: Look, again, this is not my problem. I need service restored immediately. Do you not understand my boyfriend might have died in the night and nobody had a way to contact me? on compassionate grounds if nothing else you should restore my service immediately. Please, this is the man I love and we were involved in a head-on collision last week but by the grace of God I am OK.

We had asked repeatedly for an uptime reliability number of 99.999% but he danced around it as he never addressed the question. I asked sales when I might receive the network CIDR information so I could begin programming a router for Houston. She said as soon as the work order gets processed, which I understood, based on prior experience, is when the installer technician goes out.</p>\n<p>On July 22, I received an email confirmation for the scheduled installation from Sharica **  at Comcast, but it contained no network information. I replied to our service deliver professional, Sharica ** and asked for out network information again.</p>\n<p>On the installation date, July 26, the technician showed up late, I have attached an email saying he should be arriving 2PM Houston time at the latest. The technician told me that cable company ran out of cable modems at the warehouse and offered to install an older model Docsis 2.0 modem. Then the next day, I received the static IP information which was left to me by the installer. I noticed it was wrong. 75.148.242.191/30, we cannot have a gateway of .192 because it is outside of the subnet, so I must again wait for confirmation from Comcast whether all the CIDR numbers I received were wrong. I postponed the network router programming.</p>\n<p>On August 8,2011, I discovered that the IP information that was given to us was way off so our router programming failed. I knew the subnet looked fishy, but I attempted to correct it myself with a broader subnet, with no success.I had no way of knowing this unless I called Comcast myself and asked for IP information again, which I did yesterday. It took a few minutes for them to gather the IP info from their gateway. I transcribed them into email. And because the IP was so different, the network hardware had to be reset and programming efforts had to restart. I am only about 20% done with that and I expect it to take another week. Aside from that they sent the billing invoice to the Houston location instead of th Goleta office.  The total amount: $443.66 which is presumable for installation, Docsis 2.0 modem and first month's rate.</p>\n<p>Lastly, since our cable modem is still the Docsis 2.0, our speed are not 50/10, but initial tests showed  it to be 25/5.</p>\n<p>I'm sure our saga will continue, but I am starting to lose my sense of humor about this and I've already filed a complaint with BBB and FCC. Sadly, this is the side effect of a greater problem : Regional ISP Exclusivity.</p>\n", "<p>I made an appointment for Comcast technician to come install the internet on 08/20, which is a Saturday. I wrote down the appointment date and time and was sure I made an appointment on Saturday, since I work Monday to Friday. On Friday 08/19, I got a call on my cellphone at work from a Comcast technician telling me he is at the door. I was so surprised because I was sure the appointment was next day. The guy had a really bad attitude and was impatient to check up the schedule per my request. Then he admitted it's the wrong day and hung up. </p>\n<p>The next day, Saturday afternoon, I stayed at home the entire afternoon and nobody showed up. Then I called the technician since I got his number on my call display earlier. I called him first time, he picked up and grumbled and hung up on me. Then I called again, he picked up and heard it was me again and hung up again. I was furious, then I called Comcast customer service. The customer service representative also had a really bad attitude and told me \"well, we don't have appointment until September. Now, do you want to keep it or not now?\". I was appalled.

They suck and should lose any deal they have with the city or be forced to upgrade the crap equipment.  </p>\n<p>I am so sick of hearing that I need to pay my outrageous bill on time but they just thanked me for my patience of not getting what I am paying for.  I want the service that I am paying for.

When I threatened to switch services, Michael the rep offered 60 Mbps for half the price at $29.99. Of course we accepted! Comcast set up our internet service in November and ever since our speed has been painfully slow. The internet service is so slow that we can't do our Christmas shopping. We can barely open one browser at a time and we regularly experience pages that never load at all. We chatted with a rep who asked for all of our security info and actually wrote, \"Thank you for trusting me with all of your personal security information.\" I provided the last 4 of the SSN, DOB, address, and account number; then the rep disconnected our chat before even assisting us! Yikes! \r\n\r\nWe called to complain about the slow service and chat experience. The rep said we were only getting 1.5 Mbps. He said we needed to call back during the day since he couldn't do anything to help, not even take a message. We were very dismayed with Comcast, especially by the slow speed, so I sent them an email. Those crooks at Comcast responded by email, \"We do not even offer a 60Mbps level of service.\" But they are caught because a rep we talked to over the phone previously said they were offering 60 Mbps for $29.99 not too long ago, which is when we heard about it. They said, \"You are on a special rate for our Performance level of service (Downstream speed up to 12 Mbps/Upstream speed up to 2 Mbps).\" \r\n\r\nThe Comcast email we just received continued to add insult to injury and say, \"If you have proof of the offer you refer to, you can try scanning and emailing things to us but most attachments are stripped at the server level by our firewall so we cannot guarantee we would receive it. If you cannot email things, please fax us instead.\" Lesson learned here: do not to trust anything Comcast says. And finally they admit to overcharging us $10, stating, \"In closing, the $10 was for a Self Installation Kit but review shows no kit was ever sent to you. \r\n\r\nI apologize for the error. Your account has been credited for this $10. Please note that due to some current limitations with our billing platform the credit may not show via online billing for another 3-5 business days and you may even need to wait to receive your next bill to see the changes.\" The bottom line is \r\nthey are crooks. I'm so perplexed by the unethical business practices and poor customer service that I'm ready to switch to another provider a.s.a.p.", "My original complaint is outlined below. (scroll down a bit) I followed Rick **'s advise and called 800 391 3000. I was routed to the endless endless voice prompts that ironically was outlined in my original complaint. Guess what?

I have to call the voice prompts.\r\n\r\nWhen I got through, the technical person said she does not handle complaints, she handles technical issues. I asked for the complaint phone number. She said a phone number that handles complaints does not exist.\r\n\r\nThat figures.

Back in May, for some reason I could not make an on line payment and needed to speak to someone on the phone. (I think your site was down) I had been working round the clock getting a project with a tight deadline out the door. I was having awful problems getting through. I was so tired I was cross eyed and wanted to go home and sleep. But I needed to make sure my bill was paid so I would be able to continue business. Then I ended up with being help captive by your (non) customer service. So I thought I would spend a little time emailing anyone at Comcast that could help. Or anyone that would care.\r\n\r\nSee the text of the email below in blue and the attached screen shot of all my \"sent\" emails.\r\n\r\nI think one person called me and she raved that Comcast customer service was the best. (really?) That was it. From all these emails. One person responded and didn't even address the problem? And of course they couldn't do anything because they did not have the knowledge of how to resolve the problem. I'm sure her paycheck depends on her defending Comcast and using words like \"Customers come first\". No one knew how to escalate an issues. The voice prompts / recorded sales messages are seemingly untouchable. It simply didn't matter that I was at wits end. It didn't matter that I was the customer and had to spend (a lot of) time to document all the voice prompts in hopes of catching someone's attention. At one point later I did get a woman on the phone and I was not nice. I wanted to prove a point and read the following as slowly as your voice prompts. She kept interrupting me. Sir! Sir! Sir! (I wish I could interrupt your voice prompts).\r\n\r\nA month or so ago ,I finally got a hold of someone who said I could just call Customer Retention directly if I wanted to make payments. Doesn't that seem to little to late? I previously had Comcast at both home and office but did not have a contract at my home so I've successfully gotten rid of that issue.\r\n\r\nDid it fix the problem? Does it make me feel better that I have to call Customer Retention? Is it right that I have a dreaded sick feeling I need to dial a Comcast number if I have technical issues?\r\n\r\nPlease read below and then tell me you think I should be held to my Comcast contract. (keeping in mind this email was a culmination of issues calling with both my home and office).\r\n\r\nKerry\r\n******************************************\r\n\r\nI have called in a few times with cable issues lately. I wonder if anyone with any power at Comcast has done this lately? (call your own customer service). It's really amazing. And it's particularly a problem when you have to call in when you get cut off.\r\nHere's how it goes.\r\n\r\nBefore you read the following think of working a chaotic week and all you want to do is sit down and watch the news. But wait. There is no signal and there's a problem with the box. So I call to see if I can somehow catch the news but instead I need to spend the better part of an hour with the following...\r\n\r\nConsider reading the following slowly to get the full affect.\r\n\r\nDial.\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nWelcome to xfinity.\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nYour call may be recorded for quality assurance. (Pause)\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\n\"Sunday, May xx, www.Eover the limit.com. Press 'x\" to order this event\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nFor Cable Press 1, For internet press 2\" blah blah\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nSpanish voice......\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nIf you are calling about your new guide and new features, please visit www.meetyournewguide.com\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nPress one after your call to complete a customer service survey\"\r\n(digital noise a few second pause)\r\nPlease enter your phone number. (This is when I enter my phone number but the system thinks I'm calling about my home or office Comcast service. So hang up and repeat from beginning)\r\nPress one if you have no picture. Press 2 if you ......\r\n\r\nAnd it goes on for a few more minutes with voice prompts.\r\n\r\nHas Xfinity ever done any research on customer service satisfaction? Have you read the studies? Have you given any thought to the complaints? Does a large company care? It seems so simple to look at large companies that have superior customer service. (take lessons from TMobile!). I've made several calls and made several pleas for change. I had one \"manager\" tell me Comcast gets rave reviews of their customer service and customers like the voice prompts. Hmmm. Really?\r\nA large company like Comcast (or is it xfinity? ) probably does not need to care. However it seems so easy to actually care about your customers and make a few small changes.\r\n\r\nI will do whatever I can to not use Comcast when my contract is up. And if Comcast would find it in their large corporate heart to release me from the contract, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nKerry **\r\n*****************************************************\r\nOn Dec 7, 2011, at 7:16 PM, Comcast ECARE wrote:\r\n\r\nDear Mr. **,\r\n\r\nI would like to thank you for contacting us here at Comcast, where our customers come first.

Also, it is very frustrating to select a movie that states it is close captioned and then find out I cannot watch it.

They also billed me $4.01 for something. Maybe the \"free\" boxes. I have been on hold for 123 minutes waiting to ask them what I should do with these three extra boxes they sent me in error. It would seem they would be too expensive to toss. Before this 100-some-minute hold, I held for 23 minutes before they disconnected me. This is not the first time I've spent my time waiting for them to answer me. September of 2011 I had a service installed that they never activated but kept billing me for. I called 11 times over a period of four months and an average of 63 minutes each call to get this straighten out.

In some cases they may be right as I receive my basic service through my condo fee. \r\n\r\nI really hate them.  I would rather not have TV than to deal with anyone who has so little respect for their \"customers\". I'm sure I am not the only person who has had to endure this mistreatment.

I told them I was reading the confirmation email that stated a one-time $25.00 installation fee. After calling 3 times and getting disconnected twice, I was told they were going to do me a favor and credit my account $25.00 next month. I was told the $30 in-home service fee is for them coming out, not for installing, even though it was never mentioned. So I said, \u201cThen shouldn't you advertise it as $55.00 install fee?\u201d I got no reply.", "Today, I called Comcast and I tried to find out how much I owe them until the end of March 2012 so I have time to switch the service and I can still use the internet until the last day of my residence at the current address. When I talked to the customer service woman, she told me that I have to pay them additional $20 or $25 because last month there was an additional automatic payment attempted that was later reversed by my bank. The additional charge for that attempted payment that was later reversed is $20 or maybe it was $25. I checked my checking account for Comcast past payments. I had them preset so they were automatically send to Comcast every month for last 2-3 years. There was no record of any paid and later reversed payments made to Comcast in the bank on my paid bills bank list. I even called the bank and when I told them what had happened, they told me that they have on records other than the ones that I see on their bank website. I called Comcast again and then they told me that I should ask my bank to verifying that that that specific attempted payment was not made. That request was simply crazy and completely unjustified. \r\n\r\nI then told Comcast that since they are charging me not the other way around, they should verify to me that attempted payment. They should have documents regarding all charges posted to the customers accounts, including documents regarding any additional fees. Then the Comcast employee told me that those proofs are part of the Comcast general accounting ledger and that they cannot share that information with me. That was too much. I told them that my bank payment verification is also part of my personal general accounting ledger and that I also cannot share that information with them. At the end, I just could not keep that service any longer and let them use my money. I told them to discontinue the service tomorrow. That is how on March 6, 2012, my seven-year long relationship with Comcast has ended. I wish everybody could stop using their services, then and only then this monopolistic behavior will stop.

Whenever I call to ask about what could be wrong, they constantly try to blame the problem on my router or modem, both of which I replaced already the first time they told me to, or put me on hold for an unreasonably long amount of time.

They found out that the problem was at their box due to a loose connection. They sent me a bill for $51.00 service fee even though I pay more than $200.00 per month for their service. Comcast is a disrespectful company. Stop using Comcast. Their customer service stinks.", "I had no internet connection due to an outage in our area. I called Comcast to establish a new connection. They gave minimal internet connection, referred me to Signature Support as they did not fix this issue, and charged me $39.95. I called to cancel twice within 24 hours and twice after 24 hours. They refused to give me a confirmation number for my cancellation. Comcast is the ISP and is responsible for my having an internet connection, yet they tried to bill me when this all stemmed from their initial outage.", "Internet service is intermittent and slow. I've been having extremely unstable internet the last few weeks, with a lot of cuts and very slow speeds. I contacted the customer service 2 times with absolutely no solution and no other answer than \"It's your fault. We see everything is fine on our side.\"", "I am writing to let you know of unethical business practices by Comcast. As far as I know, Comcast holds a monopoly at my address as Comcast is apparently the only high speed internet service available to me at my Olympia address. On December 15, 2012, my internet service quit working. I called Comcast to report the outage or malfunction. I was put on hold for probably the better part of an hour. Eventually, my call was transferred. After transfer, I was offered a service for under $10.00 (it was either $9.95 or $9.99, but I can't remember which). I was told that it would be a one-time charge and that if I agreed to pay nearly $10.00, they could fix the problem - which according to them was my problem, not Comcast's. \r\n\r\nI was impressed with the fact that the agents on the phone seemed incompetent and incapable of listening to me to find out the description of the problem. They put me on hold again. I was impressed with what appeared to be their method of guessing what the problem might be and guessing how it might be fixed. I'm a good guesser too, so I wasn't too sure that I wanted to pay them almost $10.00 to do what I could do equally well myself, but I was in a state of disbelief at that moment because I thought that rationally they should know what they are doing. While I was on hold, I fixed the problem myself. When the agent came back on the line, I said never mind. I didn't need their help and I didn't want to go back on hold again. They said okay. We hung up.\r\n\r\nLater, I received a letter from Comcast captioned: Welcome to Xfinity Signature Support. This looked suspicious to me, as if I were signed up from something I didn't want. So I called Comcast on December 26, 2012 to inquire and to make sure I wasn't going to get billed. I was put on hold for more than an hour. When an agent finally came on the line, she told me that the charge would be removed and that the subscription would be cancelled. I thanked her and I hung up. On January 11, 2013, the monthly bill from Comcast arrived. There was a charge of $39.00 for an item described as enrollment fee with a sub-line as follows: Wireless Networking and Computer Performance. \r\n\r\nI called Comcast about the charge at 2:30PM on January 12, 2013. I was put on hold. I was on hold for more than an hour until 3:38PM, when the battery on my cordless phone died. On the same day, at 4:10PM, I called again. I was put on hold. At 6:35PM, the phone died when the battery expired. I never spoke with anyone. The charge on my bill is fraudulent. I never asked for the service, was never informed of the charge, and never agreed to it. The only thing I was ever informed of was a one time charge of less than $10.00, but the agents who provided the service appeared to be incompetent. All they ever did for me was keep me on hold. I told them never mind and that I didn't want their help after all, and they said okay. I thought that I might nevertheless get scammed out of $10.00, but I am very surprised to see a bill for $39.00. \r\n\r\nI would proudly discontinue any business relationship with Comcast, but as I said initially, as far as I know Comcast is the only business that provides high speed internet at my address in Olympia. I would proudly drop out and refuse to subscribe to any internet, cable television or telephone services, but the fact is that I need internet for more than mere amusement. But there's only one high speed internet provider, Comcast, who rips me off. Please help.", "I called Comcast to schedule an appointment for a tech to come out and install wireless Internet for my parents. The service rep stated a one-time flat fee of $25 on the bill would be applied. The day the technician showed up, he said there was a $49.95 charge for installation of WiFi - I said we were not told that when I placed the order. He said that most people are not told. Well, what can you do? We needed the service so we said okay. He was there 4 hours and changed out 2 modems - we had WiFi but only in a few rooms and then the cable was knocked out in two bedrooms.\r\n\r\nMy mother who is retired and on a fixed income called Comcast to ask about the fees and she was given an 800 number where she did have her call answered by someone outside the US. She was frustrated that no one would help her. So I called them and I also was sent to a number and the lady said she was in Asia. I said, \"Where are you?\" She said, \"the Philippines.\" I said, \"How do I reach a main office in Atlanta?\" She said, \"Well, let me transfer you and see where you wind up.\"\r\n\r\nI got connected to a lady in Tennessee and she couldn't give me a local office or email address and told me to go back to the store where you turn in equipment and lodge a formal complaint. So I went to the local Douglasville office and she said, \"We don't have complaint forms,\" but that she would email her boss. This lady was the first person I had talked to in 3 days that even cared. It was a relief.\r\n\r\nHow can Comcast offer services and not disclose all fees at the time you place an order? It has been 3 days and order was not complete and nobody cared. I was given the customer service rep's codes or IS numbers so if I can find where I can actually file a complaint in the United States, I would love to. Why do we get transferred to a number that is out of our country and they have all our information? Our home number, social security number, address? This is the poorest of service and I am saddened that my 70-year-old parents had to go through this experience. And we wonder why we have no jobs available to us?\r\n\r\nHow does the FCC (or whoever regulates) or rather why do they let a company route service calls or questions to another country? How does that help me here in Georgia? It doesn't.", "We were loyal Comcast customers for twenty years. Due to financial incentives, we went with Verizon this month (March 12, 2013). We returned the Comcast box and modem to their service center the next day. Several years ago the router they provided us with failed and Comcast told us we had to get a new one at our expense, which we did. Now they claim they want the defective router returned and we have no idea what happened to it. Verizon provides a modem/router unit and Comcast is trying to charge us $45.00 for the old router. Why didn't they ask before? You think we'll ever be Comcast customers again and that we won't tell others of our experience?", "After many, many, many hours on the phone with Comcast and 4 appointments for service calls and one \"bucket truck tech\" who came out and fixed my down internet but refused to tell me what was wrong, saying, \"I am not at liberty to tell you what I fixed\" and whom Comcast says they have NO RECORD of coming out (?!), my internet is down again. It was suggested today that because I have economy internet - even though it worked perfectly for 6 months that now no longer works - well, it's economy! So this service tech did not even come out. This is 3 weeks of internet that does not work for many hours a day. It is obvious that they want me to take a more expensive internet service or they will continue shutting me down.", "So the previous tenant moved out and scheduled service disconnect on the 4th. I called on the fourth and got transferred around because the old account was still active. The operator told me he can still connect my service because the old one is scheduled to be disconnected the same day. Anyways, he went through his spiel about the packages. I told him no, I don't want a contract or a package; I want the cheapest TV and internet month to month. He then kept bringing up the packages. I told him no. \r\n\r\nHe then brought up the packages again. I told him that I want the cheapest, cheapest service, and he told me the Digital Preferred is the cheapest. I know he\u2019s lying so I told him I will call back after I look up the services online. The cheapest TV is Limited Basic and $25 a month, and I choose Performance Starter at 6 MB for $50 a month. I called back and the operator told me he \u201ccannot activate services\u201d because even though the previous tenant\u2019s scheduled disconnection was today, Comcast was not actually going to come out and disconnect the service till the 26th... and that I would have to go to the nearest Comcast service building to get them to change the disconnect date. How what???\r\n", "On July 2, I contacted Comcast moving service. After a thirty-minute call the analyst transferred me to another person. This person would supposedly set up a service person to come to my slip and confirm services were available. This second call took another 30 minutes. I was issued a service ticket number and told to call back if I did not hear from the service person by the following Monday. No call from any Comcast employee. I called again and spoke with another analyst. This person could not comprehend that if there was service at B24, B10 and B3 there should be service at B7. This person told me, \"Sorry, I can't help you. Call the moving specialist (the number I called was to the moving service).\" I spent another 35 minutes on this call. \r\n\r\nI called the next number and was told that the analyst would check into the problem and that I should call back in one hour. This analyst sent me a link that would supposedly get me back to her so I would not have to explain the issue again. When I called the link I got another person who was clueless to what I was trying to accomplish. He transferred my call to yet another person who promised that by the next Wednesday, I would be contacted by a field service agent. No call on Wednesday. I called again and after going through the whole issue one more time, I was told I would be contacted by that Friday. No call. I called again and talked to another person who seemed to understand the issue. He could see that there was service on the dock. He gave me another ticket number and said that I would be contacted by this Thursday. No call again. So it has been 16 days and over five hours of my time trying to just get Comcast to transfer my service 100 yards from slip 43A to B7. How can I resolve this and get my service moved and be reimbursed for the days I was not provided service after my move request?", "I got the home security and internet and cable package and they told me it will be $150 a month. I got my first bill and it was $500. Next month it was $700 so I stopped using them. They are really rude to you when you ask them a question about the bill.", "For the past several days, we have experienced terrible internet connectivity. Normally we do not have major problems, but it has been a chore just to browse the internet or even read email. Not to mention the fact that both my son and I play online games. I just spent a frustrating 15 minutes just trying to get the Comcast technician to slow down and speak clearly enough so I could understand what he was saying relative to the connectivity issues I explained to him. Got disconnected in the middle of that only to get him back on the line and then he kept saying he could not hear me. Instead of trying to find a supervisor, he said there was none available...so I was stuck. Then the call disconnected again....I suspect he just hung up on me.\r\n\r\nComcast NEEDS to fix their service problems. Having no alternative to calling in to get another technician or even a supervisor to help if the technician one is speaking with is not helping, is a major problem. Then to top all this off, the very first thing he tells me is our modem is obsolete...and will fail to function within a few month's time. Excuse me? He could not explain that comment to my satisfaction, so he got irritated with me and wanted me to connect my PC directly to the modem bypassing the router. My answer to that was this: If we had decent connectivity up until just a few days ago, how does that change things when we have not changed equipment in our house? Does not make sense.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to find a direct line to complain to them so came here to submit this complaint. It would be nice if Comcast had someone we could actually speak to without all the runaround and idiotic answers their technicians seem to give us for comment problems.", "Transferred service twice. Lied to when asked if I would be charged any fees. 1st time service installed, phone never worked and was charged installation fees all over again. Second transfer, I made sure to make it a self install. Account was noted and I still was charged all over again. Called for refund, had to argue for an hour to get full credit or let them know I would be canceling service. Added additional line and tech did such a poor job it knocked the phone off and all the other boxes off. We had to uninstall what he attempted to do and reroute the lines. Boxes constantly need reset. Volume on boxes do not work all the time either. DVR constantly goes off line. \r\n\r\nCalled this evening to reset a box. After 1st attempt, tech was to call back to see if problem was resolved and never called back. Had to make another call again, switched boxes and found the box was not broke, so the connection is not properly done. After a very long time and much frustration, I was told it was my fault the lines are not working properly even though all lines were cleared on Aug 17 and fully functional until second repairman came and did a hack job installing another room. I was asked to pay more money and be responsible for more charges if they need to fix the problem. How am I responsible if it was done right the first time? It hasn't even been thirty days. I'm very disappointed in the quality of Comcast customer service and craftsmanship of Comcast equipment. I'm paying for service and can barely watch it without calling in first.", "My Comcast Account number was ** and I had disconnected all my services as of 10/29/2013. Earlier I had Double play (cable and Internet) and the bill for the same services up to 10/08 to 11/07 ($89.99+$21.93+tax = $115.91) was paid on 10/25/2013. I had disconnected the cable on 10/25/2013 so in billing from Comcast dated 11/2/2013 (total bill of $16.18), the partial refunds were issued for prorated period between 10/25 to 11/07 for Double play. The internet service was changed as XFINITY High Speed Internet with the net monthly charge of $44.99 (11/8 to 12/7) and also charged for the adjusted period of 14 days (10/25 to 11/07) for $29.33-$9.01 = $20.32 with net total of $65.31 for High Speed Internet service from 10/25 to 12/07.\r\n\r\nThen I also disconnected the XFINITY High Speed Internet service on 10/29/2013 but the final bill I received on 11/21/2013 had issued the refund for as High Speed Internet only from 11/21 to 12/07 and the refund for the XFINITY High Speed Internet for period between 10/29 and 11/20 is missing which might worth around $40. Even though the representatives agree that my High Speed Internet was disconnected on 10/29, they are wrongly claiming that I have received the full refund which is not true and is totally incorrect.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about it, the account rep is confusing with actual order date and completed disconnection date... and also rep is saying that there is no additional charges... and I have not paid for that period and the bill is correct and can't issue the refund. Even I explained I am receiving a refund for Internet services I had paid up to 12/7 but the refund is issued only from 11/21 to 12/7 instead of the actual cancellation date of 10/29 to 12/7. I am not disputing the bill. The bill has issued a refund for me from 11/21 to 12/7 but the actual refund should have been from 10/29 to 12/7. Why no one is able to get this simple issue cleared out and issue a proper and correct refund and how many customers are being cheated like this.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here? I was on the phone with reps may be more than 10 times for a total of around 6 to 8 hrs...but no use. Why this treatment? They agree that I called for disconnecting my service on 10/29 but trying to come up with various weird reasons to deny my eligible prorated correct refund.", "Earlier this year we upgraded our internet service. We have been plagued with lag spikes ever since. We game, stream, and download virtual products regular. We have a top of the line router. Prior to upgrading our connection, we began to experience daily disconnections during peak hours. Comcast suggested upgrading when we complained, so we did.\r\n\r\nI can't tell you what's worse - good speeds with daily outages or fluctuating speeds and weekly outages. There have been days when our speeds are 15kb/s. If I could change to another broadband ISP, I'd have no hesitation. I'd even pay more if meant leaving Comcast in the dust. My European friends laugh at my expensively slow internet...\r\n", "I got my internet speed check and highest it got was 0.02 at 3:00pm - 2:30am and at the middle of the morning I get to 3.00 internet speed, so that mean I cannot go on internet unless I want to stay up all night.", "I was with Comcast for almost 3 years and after my promotion was up my bill continued to get higher. So I decided to not pay them and let them shut me off. After my services were shut off I paid them $561 to clear my debt or so I thought. They sent me another bill saying I owed $158. This is ridiculous! They are supposed to shut you off after 2 months of no payment and I thought $561 was a bit high, but my anger went through the roof when they sent me another bill. Never again will I go through this business.", "Can you give negative stars? This is about dropping internet connection. I have called them several times over the past 5 weeks to tell them their node in my neighborhood is overloaded. Obviously with no action on their part, it's getting worse. Today, from 2 am to 7 pm, my network monitoring software shows 8 outages. So what am I paying for? It's time for a class action lawsuit against Comcast. This is unacceptable, intermittent service.", "My email was apparently hacked into and incoming emails were forwarded (unauthorized).  I called Comcast about it and during one of the calls, I found out that the technician turned off the unauthorized forwarding without my knowledge (so I could get emails again).  Unfortunately, this deleted the only way to find out who hacked into my account.\r\n\r\nI called to complain and at the Executive Corporate Office, the man told me that they were forbidden to change anything without the customer's authorization.  He called back, after researching, and told me that a technician \"coached by the supervisor\" did in fact delete the information without my knowledge.  I told him that I got ** over and no one there had to have any accountability for those actions.  He did not address that comment at all, but told me to call him if there was anything suspicious going with my email.\r\n\r\nHe went on to say that the tech was a \"real nice guy,\" etc. which I did agree--they're all nice, but that was not the point.  I told him that I was the one that got hacked into with no way of ever finding out because of Comcast and I was tired of them (previous encounters).  He offered no apology and did not suggest anything Comcast could do to make up for this obvious breach of rules and security.", "I recently moved to Alvin and made an appointment for Comcast to set up the internet connection. When the technician arrived, she said that because some of the neighbors had cables hanging low, mine had to hang low (ended up 4 feet off the ground) as well but that it would be fixed in a few days. \r\n\r\nAfter a couple days, the cable was only 2 feet off the ground and I had to step over it several times a day and tripped and fell one time. A week later, nothing had been done. I called Comcast, and they said they would send someone. Late in the day, no one had arrived. I called and they said there was no guarantee is would be fixed that day. I said it was a danger and I had already been hurt. They did send out a technician who buried the cable and who told me it should never have been left that way by the first technician.\r\n\r\nI emailed Comcast and told them how I felt and mentioned to them a crimped cord in the front yard. They never even replied. I feel like Comcast puts my safety last and I agree with their own technician that it was an unsafe install and should not have been left that way, and I feel that Comcast forgetting to follow up shows how little they care.", "Today is Thursday, October 20th. I have not had internet since sometime Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, it was shutting on and off all day long, making it virtually useless. On Sunday, we called and we're told that we were one of the seven modems down. The lady was very nice and did all she could to help. Monday, we called again because it was still down. The lady was extremely rude and obviously hates her job. A request was put in for a tech to come out between 2 and 5PM on Wednesday. I sat all day yesterday waiting for someone to show up. Nothing, so I called. \"Oh no ma'am, you were scheduled for an exterior cable inspection which was completed\". Lies! I was home all day, no one came.

I called support and they said they can't fix or configure router issues unless I enroll to a program which costs $40.00 plus $5.00 a month. It doesn't make sense at all! Talking and complaining, I got hung up 4 times by very rude customer service staff. I've been waiting on line for 30 minutes to get to talk to a manager. I don't think I make sense to get high speed internet if the person who comes to connect the internet doesn't make a test or configure the router to make the service work as it's supposed to.

The internet service provided by management is slow, so I wanted to buy an internet plan. I had such a terrible customer service experience, for the first time in my life. I had called Comcast to inquire about the plans and charges for installation, and everything. The lady on the other side, had an accent that is difficult to understand.  She got irritated if asked twice due, to disturbance. \r\n\r\nShe kept insisting that I should buy the $99 package, even after telling politely, I was not interested.  After knowing the cost information, I told her I will consult with my roommate, and call back.  I was shocked when I heard her reply.  She said: \"after answering your all questions, and taking all my time, you are not even buying?\".  I asked if Comcast charges for customer service and time, but she hung up on me.\r\n\r\nI never had a such terrible service before. I don't think anyone would like to buy the service with this kind of terrible response. I am highly disappointed. I hope you would improve the staff. Thank you.", "It was a horrible experience getting them to come out and turn on my service. My appointment was canceled by them 3 times and it took me a month to get cable, that put a bad taste in my mouth as a new customer. After a year of horrible service, their representative called and insulted me that I owed them for the month of October and they didn't received the payment. When I checked, I never received the bill after telling her that she said I had a chat online with them and went paperless. That was a pile of **. I didn't even know I can do that after telling her that it was not me. \r\n\r\nI am afraid that my account might be hacked. She accused me of trying to get out of paying the bill and that was an insult to me especially never being late on any payments before.

We moved locally and decided to go with Comcast TV instead of Dish Network.  We had the Internet service transferred to our new location and added TV on May 26, 2011.  When speaking to the customer service representative in placing our order, we were told our total costs for TV would be $89.99 a month, inclusive of everything.  She also guaranteed us a 30-day no-charge if we decided to cancel.  Sounded good.  </p>\n<p>After moving and watching Comcast TV, we did not like it.  You had to jump all over the place to obtain the channels we were used to watching.  We reinstated Dish Network, just love it, and cancelled the TV service on June 7, 2011.  The Comcast tech disconnected the TV service on June 8, 2011.  When we received our first bill, it was in the amount of $316.49.  We almost had a heart attack.  We were charged for the TV  double play promotion in the amount of $89.99, then $6.95 for sports package (which we thought was included, according to the service rep), $15.95 for additional outlet service, $9.95 for HD DVR service, modem Rental of $7.00, A/O Same Trip (3@$19.95 each, what ever this is) for a total of $59.85, Transfer from Account to new account of $49.98, Installation of $39.95, installation fee discount of $29.95, taxes, surcharges and fees of $6.92, for a total of $316.49.  </p>\n<p>Over the past two months, I have contacted Comcast customer service both by phone and online.  I have talked with over 20 people.  Some could not explain the bill, some told me they had no record of our disconnect, and others told me that everything was being taken care of, all the charges connected to the TV cancellation would take two-three months to come off our bill.  Our Internet was being deducted from our checking account, as we had always had done.  The last person I spoke to was Robb on July 11, 2011.  Robb is in billing and he assured me that all payments for our Internet service had been debited from our checking account and we were up-to-date on all Internet payments.</p>\n<p>Today, I have no Internet.  I started at 7:45 a.m. calling Comcast.  I spoke to five different people, being transferred, waiting, etc.  Finally I reached a man who explained to me that we owed $303 for Internet charges from May 1, 2011 plus service charges.  Non payment is the reason our Internet was disconnected.  My fault, I did not check my back account more closely.  Nevertheless, as stated above, I spoke to more than 20 people over the past two months regarding my bill, and all told me everything was OK.   </p>\n<p>I discovered, in speaking with this customer rep, that we were being charged for Internet service (OK, I will pay for this, and would have all along), plus service calls and account transfer.  The account transfer fee we had deleted from our bill with one of the customer reps somewhere along the past two months.  I was told this was to establish a new account.  New account--$49.98 to establish a new account!  This rep gave me credit at that time, but this rep I spoke to today stated this credit should never have happened.  He explained that we now have a new account number.  Whoopee, $49.98 for someone to give us a new number.  We were the same customers, same people.  </p>\n<p>I told him this was robbery. He left this credit alone but let me know repeatedly that I was receiving this credit when I should not have.  When I questioned the service call, I was told it was to fix our Internet.  When the service rep came out to install the TV service on June 8, 2011, he messed with our Internet service and our Internet later stopped working.  The service call from Comcast the next day was because of this.   I told him I refused to pay for service that was Comcast's fault.  </p>\n<p>After over two hours on the phone, I received a deduction in the amount of $71.93, and paid my Internet account up to date.  I suggested to this rep that he speak to his supervisor and mandate that whenever a rep speaks on the phone to any customer, that the conversation be documented under that customer's account number, so other reps can have the history of the problems.  This rep said this is supposed to be done but a lot of reps just don't do it.  So I have been over two months on the phone with Comcast just to resolve an issue I was told was taken care of.  </p>\n<p>Something needs to be done, as this company has the \"GOD\" syndrome.  We in Martinsburg, WV, do not have many choices for high-speed Internet; therefore, we are at their mercy.  Their prices are way too high.  They tell you one thing and then charge you complete different.  If anyone can help the public with excessive charges, please do so.  Forty-nine dollars and 98 cents to change account numbers!</p>\n", "<p>I have cable and internet with Comcast. Two words for their service, \"useless and hopeless\". The single keeps going off and on and each time I call them, they can never fix it on call and will schedule a tech appointment. The appointment can never be earlier than a week away at least. So, very often, I live without TV or internet for a week at least. This happens often, but my choices are limited as my apartment complex has a tie up with Comcast. </p>\n", "Comcast is blocking any access to New Zealand websites. I checked with friends who also have Comcast in the Denver metro area and they can't access .nz site either. Comcast is telling me it's my router and modem, but it's not. I can access the site on my iPhone over my 3G service, but not my Comcast WiFi. Comcast said they can help me if I pay for the Xfinity Signature service, but I'm not paying for something that is a network issue. What's the deal, Comcast?", "They are charging for late fees and my payment was never late!  I have the paperwork to prove it.  They try pulling these moves on people all the time, hoping you won't notice.  This is unfair business practices!", "I started having trouble with my internet on Jan. 4, 2012 a little after 10 pm.  I called Comcast and spoke with someone about the problem.  Right away they were insisting it was due to my equipment.  I told them that when my service was set up, the tech that did the installation told me that the signal was weak on the outside wire and that there was a splice in the line from the pole to the house which shouldn't be there.  And I said that whoever at Comcast had done the job didn't know what they were doing.  Now I have no service and they do not want to run another line, saying that is not the problem.", "I have been paying for services Comcast is not providing. I have an HD box that does not work. I went to the South Burlington, VT office to exchange the box after I spent two hours on the phone with Comcast employees trying to troubleshoot my problem. The Comcast employees were rude and did not have a box to replace mine and refused to give me a DVR loaner until a new box came in. I called the corporate office and registered a complaint. They called me back today. I continue to pay for services I am not getting. They offered to send someone over, but there was a three-hour window. I cannot afford to take the time off of work. I would like someone to resolve my issue and compensate me for the two weeks I have been without service.", "I have been with Comcast for over a year now and have not had a complaint with them until now. After our Comcast introductory rate ended, I spoke with Judith at Comcast (employee own) to discuss what products could be taken off to reduce the bill. Obviously, like many, internet is not a necessity but a luxury especially in the economic environment.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy conversation, Judith at Comcast advised that we take off the \"blast internet\" to lower the monthly bill down $10.00 less to approximately $42.00 a month. While this was more expensive than what I was paying, it was understandable and manageable. I informed Judy that if the bill was any higher, I already had checked other servicers and told her I was ready to switch (which was also true and was prepared to switch to Century Link). Judith told me to wait and check the amount to pay on the online account which would allow me to continue at the rate of approximately $42.00/month without the \"blast\". To enforce our agreement, I checked the account which turned out to be around $15.00. All in all, Judith the Comcast representative undoubtedly stated she could keep our bill to around $42.00/month if we paid this extra amount to account for services already performed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of what Judith communicated to me was true. Comcast did not keep their word or honor their agreement. After paying the amount online as agreed, the next month I received a bill for over $115.00 which was not agreed upon and a breach of the agreement. After calling Comcast and speaking with employee Rob, he informed me that he could not lower the monthly bill and was not sure what Judith did on the account (big shocker that Comcast does not keep accurate notes the same way I did). Rob informed me that he reported Judith's actions to his supervisor and would credit my account $44.00 for the difference between what I was informed to pay online and what the bill later had in it. \r\n\r\nI understand promotional rates and roping in customers but when an agent flat out lies to you about a budgeted monthly expense and leads you to stay with a company only to hit you with a bill almost three times your normal monthly rate, that is an unethical bait and switch and downright dishonest. As a consumer, I need to report this information and shed light on the practices that Comcast agents are using to deceive their customers.\r\n", "I rescheduled an installation appointment for 8:00-10:00 on Jan. 31 and no one showed up. I called Comcast to ask why I kept getting the runaround with the computer automated system which automatically hangs up on me 5 times before I hit a different number for billing that reached an actual person. The customer service rep apologized for the tech not showing up and stated I would get a $20 credit and rescheduled my appointment to Feb. 6 from 8:00-10:00. The technician did not show up again, I never received a phone call or anything to cancel the appointment and after calling, the agent told me that it was cancelled due to lack of the pre-payment. I told the agent that I was never told I had to pay prior to and that had I been informed of the reason, then wouldn't I have paid to ensure I did not take off another day of work and inconvenience myself to wait on the installation of cable in my home? \r\n\r\nHe maintained composure even as I was angry to the point of being rude and then asked him for a supervisor because I explained that no one had told me I was to \"prepay\". He said he was not privy to the prior conversation, but he's reading the notes on the account. I wanted the phone conversations which I was told were recorded to be brought up so that they can see I was never told that information. After about 45 minutes of going back and forth, I was given a ticket number (**) and told that a supervisor would call me within the next 4 hours. Of course, no one ever called me back and I waited until 10:00 the next morning to call again. I was transferred to different areas and told that all supervisors were in a meeting and that my ticket would be \"expedited\" and I would be called back today. \r\n\r\nAgain, I was not called back so at around 2PM, I called to reschedule an installation appointment as Comcast is the only cable service in my area so I have no alternatives at this point. I spoke to an agent who explained that due to my appointment being \"cancelled for lack of payment\" on the two occasions she could not even give me the package that I signed up for in the first place. I have been given the runaround and I do not appreciate it since I have been a good paying customer since 2008. My time is too precious to be wasted trying to figure out why in the world I was not told to prepay and yet the account is noted that they informed me. I was again rerouted to the sales department so that I could basically start from scratch. The customer service agent was finally able to help me and she stated she did not understand the hassle because I have been a good customer and I am not even being charged a deposit, so why would they require that I prepay? \r\n\r\nComcast has a monopoly on the area and the fact that I was inconvenienced twice and took time off from work was already headache enough. But to be treated as if I am someone who does not pay my bills was even more insulting. I feel as if the fact that they are the only alternative, they don't take the responsibility of taking care of their customers very serious. I was given the runaround and told I would be called back within a certain time frame, I should not have had to call back again without some sort of resolution to the issue.", "I spoke with customer service on 2/11/12 (also November and December 2011) in regards to a payment that was made to the wrong account. The payment was made on 11/29/11 for $46.24 to an account ending in #** (this is not my account). I am no relation to that account holder. I called customer service and explained that I made a payment on the wrong account and asked that my funds be transferred to my Comcast account ending in #**. \r\n\r\nCustomer service refused to transfer the funds. They stated that there was a hold on the account I accidentally paid on and until that account was satisfied, they would not transfer my money to my account. I explained that I was of no relation or was I on that account that my money went to. I also explained that they could not keep my money and apply it to someone else\u2019s account. They adamantly refused to transfer my money to my account and stated that equipment needed to be turned in on the other users account before they would release my funds. \r\n\r\nThis is unethical and illegal. I have approached my financial institution in regards to this manner and they advised me to contact Comcast. Comcast refuses to transfer my money to my account. I am asking that Comcast return my funds to my account ending in #**.\r\n", "I have a message from Comcast that keeps popping up on my computer screen, wanting me to purchase bot or virus protection. I do not need this service, and was told by Comcast that in order for me to not get this screen showing up on my computer, I have to purchase some protection plan.", "Xfinity Program Installation - A technician came to the house on Feb. 16th, 2012 and tried to install an upgrade to Xfinity Program. He cut the exterior cable and left without any notification. We have been out of a house phone and TV for 6 days. After calling the 800 266 2278 number we've been put on hold, disconnected several times and passed around from agent to agent-finally went on line to try and make progress but the problem was not resolved. They wanted us to wait another 24-72 hours. So a \"higher department\" can contact us. When I asked for a corporate contact - They typed: We don't have that number!! Seriously? We're still without phone and TV!", "I am writing to let you know of an issue I'm having with Comcast Customer Service. Please bear in mind, I've been a customer for 3 days. Roughly an hour after the install, my service was intermittent and the phone support folks were not able to help and suggested sending someone out to my home. Now, the appointment was scheduled for today (28 Feb 2012) between 6-7 PM. The tech didn't show and claimed I wasn't home. This is demonstrably false, I've been sitting here since 5:30 PM, waiting. No phone call, door bell ring, nothing. This is upsetting to me.\r\n\r\nI had to leave work early to get home for the appointment and that isn't easy to do. I also depend on the service which, at the moment, isn't working. Not only did the tech lie to his boss, he put me out as well. I expect a higher level of service from you and am very disappointed.", "Phone, internet, TV break up, totally unreliable - For 2 years, we have called Comcast to complain about the service. They send service people out, they all tell us the problem is not enough power coming from the street. The power needs to be boosted, but they refused. The service people told us Comcast will not spend the money to correct it.", "Comcast TV, internet, home phone - I switched service from Century Link on 8/4/2011 to Comcast. I am continuing to be billed by Century Link. When I switched, Comcast stated they would take care of paperwork but neither will help with problem after being contacted several times. Both parties are wanting payment. I am paying Comcast for their service. I need help in resolving this problem.", "Charge way too much money - I live in a little town. The only way I can get TV is to get Comcast. Dish TV needs a credit card which I do not own one. I pay $150.00 each month just to get nothing. And there is not a ** thing I can do. I\u2019m on SSI disability income. So they know if I can go get something new, they got you where they want you at.", "I moved house last February 15, 2012. Prior to the move, I called to terminate my cable/Phone/Internet with Comcast. I was advised to return the following items: 2 receivers and the modem. My husband paid all the unpaid bills so that we can transfer the service to the other home. I then went to Comcast Gude Drive office to return all the equipment they asked, 2 receivers and 1 modem box, and in fact, I also returned 2 remote controls. I made sure to go and return these items myself to make sure that they were really returned. \r\n\r\nAfter one month, I get a bill from Comcast for $299.95. I called to question this bill, but no one seemed to know which department can help me. I was passed around into different departments, and the last person I spoke with, hanged up on me when I said I could barely hear her because her voice seemed so far away. So today, 3/19/2012, I drove to Comcast again, lined up like the rests of the people and waited patiently for my turn. The gentleman who helped ( thank god he was very nice), told me the items were not returned so he gave me a breakdown of the bill ($164.00 for the receivers, $80.00, and $55.65 for an additional charge for keeping the service on the other house).\r\n\r\nMy husband said the bill from the other house was already fully paid and he has a receipt for it. He said he can take out the $164.00 charges for receivers that were not returned, but not the $80.00 for the modem. I told him my story, but he said he cannot do anything about it. He needs the receipt to show I returned them. But won't their system show the transaction? He said there was an activity, but he won't tell me exactly what they were. Why would he give me a credit for the receivers and not the modem if his computer says I did not return anything? Why would the system show that I was there that day if I did not return anything? I wouldn't simply waste my time lining up, waiting for a period of time, if I did not have a purpose! Because I did return all 3 items and now they're telling me and charging me for the items that were not returned, it's all a lie!\r\n\r\nThis is all unfair! I think it is money making gimmick! How in the world did this happen, when I, personally brought those items and saw the man logged it in his computer, said everything is done and gave me the receipt. I can't find my receipt at this point, I am not sure if I kept it or maybe misplaced it during the move. But in all honesty, they have the items and I am being charged for it! I feel cheated and treated unfairly! I do not owe Comcast anything, please somebody help me! I told the Comcast representative that it is not a million dollars to pay, but the principle of it all, that I went and returned the items and now I am being told I did not! How can they employ people like these to handle these transactions and leave their costumers in so much grief!", "Many months ago, I signed up for Comcast Extreme 50 internet service and am billed at $100 per month. When the internet is working (which it often doesn't), I have never got the speeds they promised me. Best speeds are (via ethernet cable i.e. wired) 9-13Mbs download and 4Mbs upload. Service is often so slow, it times out. Repeated visits by technicians who tested it and said it was not their area of expertise and someone else would come to fix the issue. \r\n\r\nAt their recommendation, I have purchased a new modem and upgraded both my router and adapter. Repeated appointments made with Comcast and technicians failed to arrive. One technician determined that cables from the Comcast box in building to my unit need replacing, as do the cables within my unit. Repeated complaints to Comcast technicians and still, the issue is not fixed. When I threatened to go public via social media, they sent someone out to replace the cables from the box to my unit, but the guy said he couldn't replace the other cables as he \"didn't have white cable only black\". He told me someone would contact me within 48 hours to come and replace the rest of the cabling. A week later, and nothing. \r\n\r\nComcast refuses to lower my bill while I am not getting the correct speeds, and insists I continue to pay full price for a service which I am not getting. Unfortunately, Comcast has a lock on the downtown DC area, including this building, and no other provider is able to service this building to provide internet services. Still, that does not give them the authority to charge for a service that they are unable to provide. \r\n", "Customer Service, Canceled Account and Billing : I selected Comcast to handle my landline and my internet service. An appointment was selected and they came out during the appointment on March 8, 2012 and everything was fine. Until I woke up the next morning (March 9, 2012) to discover I did not have a landline dial tone, but I also did not have internet service. I contacted Comcast to find out what the problem was but found that they were unable to locate my account in the system. After approximately 15 minutes of searching, they located my account and determined the individual who installed my service did not \"push\" the order through and they would need to correct this matter. Within 90 minutes the internet was back up but the landline was not. I was told I would receive a phone call to confirm the landline was taken care of but that call never came. \r\n\r\nJust 45 minutes after the internet was restored, it went down again. I again contacted Comcast and the matter was \"fixed,\" but they still could not locate the phone number and that matter would be looked into and I would receive a phone call. That phone call also never came. I decided to do business with another company and have the phone number ported over. After four days of the new company being unable to port the number over, I contacted Comcast and was transferred to four different individuals before I decided to cancel the entire thing and get a new phone number. I was told I would not receive a bill because I cancelled in less than 30 days. I was never instructed where or when the equipment needed to be returned, so I took it upon myself to do this. I received a bill reflecting a balance and when I called to inquire about the charges, I was told the bill was incorrect and that I in fact did not have a balance and a new bill would be sent out. \r\n\r\nOn 3/24/12, I returned the modem and router to the Comcast store in Richmond, VA. On 4/3/12, I received a bill reflecting a credit but not for the entire amount. On 4/4/12, I began the tedious task of contacting Comcast to get the matter resolved. Beginning at 17:37 hours on 4/4/12, I was transferred to collections because Adrianna could not assist me. At 17:42 hours, I spoke with John who could not assist me but stated he would transfer me. I told John I did not want to be transferred again but wanted to speak with a supervisor. At 17:50 hours, I spoke with Matt who advised he could not help me. I disconnected the call and called back. \r\n\r\nI called back, held for 12 minutes waiting and was disconnected before I could even speak with a representative. I called back, held for 10 minutes 20 seconds and spoke with Sheila who advised me she could not assist me but would get me right over to someone. At 18:25 hours, I spoke with Larry who attempted to assist me but the call was disconnected. I called back and held for 25 minutes and 20 seconds and spoke with Jeremy at 19:02 hours who advised me that he could not help me and that I would need to physically go into a location with the receipt showing it has been returned and the account will be zeroed out. Jeremy advised Larry was mistaken when he said he could assist me over the phone and because they could not verify with their own eyes that the equipment had been returned they would not believe that it had been. \r\n\r\nWhen I pressed Jeremy for another solution, he advised it could be faxed but that it would take two or more days to get to him for it to be processed. I am left with no other choice but to go into the Comcast store to resolve this matter because I have a Jewish Holiday coming up and surgery and cannot wait the time period for the matter to be resolved before my account is submitted to collections and negatively impact my credit score. I am beyond upset with how disrespectful of my time Comcast has been. Customer service has not been helpful and only wants to transfer the call to someone else or advise previous information is incorrect. I do not believe what Comcast representatives advise and do not trust that this matter will actually be resolved.\r\n\r\n", "First time, they were hours late, then no call, no show by Comcast twice. On 4/6, I had an appointment for installation of new internet/cable service between 3 and 5pm. I waited until 6:15. They called and said they would be late obviously. They showed up around 7 and don't have the capability to hook up all TVs, so they run a cable on top of our driveway to our main TV and left. Today is 4/13. I haven't seen them since. They have stood us up twice this week, once on 4/11. We waited four hours for them. I called Comcast and a man told me he would call me within 15 minutes with an explanation. No one ever called. Then the next day, I called back and they informed me I had another appointment on this day, 4/12, between 3 and 5pm. Guess what? No show again! No call! Nothing. I have never been treated this disrespectfully! I have missed work waiting on this company. If I get a bill for this crappy cable that only works on one TV half the time, I will be even more upset! Do not use Comcast!", "Comcast's unwanted malware alert is the only malware on my computer. I've called (a 3-hour ordeal) and was met with pompous arrogance by a guy that claimed no supervisor was available and if there was, he'd tell me the same thing. I followed the instructions for removal to no avail and let him know this. Finally, he said he would remove this obstruction. Two days later, it's back. ", "I own a tattoo shop and recently bundled my internet with my phone service with Comcast. I run a credit card machine off our phone line. Since signing up with Comcast, our phone and internet have been down 4 times in as many weeks. We lose money each time by not having access to our credit card machine. I have spoken with Comcast on several occasions and have experienced the worst customer support ever. They seem totally incompetent. We have requested someone out to our site 3 times now and they send someone at 9 a.m. on Saturday each time although I have explained our hours over and over. This is the worst dealings I've ever had with a company.", "I've been having trouble with my Comcast internet service for several months, and I've called them repeatedly. My supposed high-speed internet service is slower than dial-up. Websites are constantly freezing and crashing my computer, and I couldn't stream a video without it freezing up for 10-15 minutes several times during a 40-minute show. Comcast said it was my fault, and they told me just reset my modem. When it got to the point where I was resetting my modem 20-30 times a day and I was still getting only intermittent, very slow connections, I called yet again. I was told to take my old modem in and get a new one. When I plugged in the brand new modem, it not only took out my internet connection, it killed my phone service. I had to take several trips back and forth to a pay phone begging them to do something. I had to wait until the next week before they'd send someone out. I waited all day and they never bothered to show up. I found out later, after another trip out to a pay phone, that they had called me and when I didn't answer my non-working phone, they decided to blow me off. So, they refused to come out and fix my non-functional phone service because my phone service doesn't work. \r\n\r\nIt's unbelievable that anyone can be that stupid! I finally got someone to come out and replace the modem, and now I'm back to where I started. I have phone service back, but my connection is extremely slow to non-existent. Websites constantly freeze and crash, and I don't have enough connection speed to stream a video. They have been screwing me around for months, and they haven't done a freaking thing to fix the problem. All they've done is made it worse. And the customer reps act like it's a big hassle to actually take my call and do their job. They're smug, mouthy, insulting, and they act by turns bored and put upon. I've had it. There's yet another person supposed to come out tomorrow. If he doesn't show or doesn't fix it once and for all, I'm transferring my service to a different company. I've had Comcast for years, but they have really hit the skids. Lousy equipment, lousy service, and lousy attitude. I'm sick of Comcast. They suck.", "Comcast discriminated against me by denying me internet access because I wouldn't take their \u201cbundle.\u201d I only wanted XFINITY internet. My neighbors have XFINITY internet and cable TV with Comcast. I signed up for XFINITY internet on 6/23/12 and paid for the cable modem. Comcast reps strung me along for 3 weeks. I called repeatedly to set up service, but their reps kept telling me that a supervisor was reviewing my address and to call back in a couple of days. Over and over again we played this game until finally I was told they can't service my address. Funny, Comcast services all my neighbors. When I try to do a search for an ISP at my address, they all say Comcast is the only ISP that can service my address. On top of all this, while they were happy to sell me the cable modem, I was told I had to deal with the company that sent me the cable modem directly to get a refund. \r\n\r\nI didn't even know there was a different company to deal with. Comcast's reps refused to help me get my money back or allow me to speak with someone in the company that could help me. I eventually got my refund on the cable modem, but only after having to deal directly with some company in Tennessee or somewhere. Comcast's customer service has to be the worst I've ever come upon. No one from Comcast even attempted to contact me during the 3 weeks I was waiting to connect my service. I had to make numerous calls to them. On top of which, no one could answer my questions. I was told time and again that the supervisor who was reviewing my address was unavailable and I should call back next Monday or Tuesday, etc. Comcast's reps kept telling me to call back in two or three days and they would have the information for me. I thought I was going to have a stroke. I was so upset when they finally told me they couldn't service my address for internet.\r\n", "They fix nothing. The online chat people are as clueless as those you speak to. I have no internet. The answer from these clowns is \"You have no internet connection, must be your equipment.\" They read from a text and have no idea what they're doing.

The worst company in America.", "Post hurricane Sandy service interruption for a week. Comcast laid a Coaxial cable from the cable box into our apartment temporarily, indicating that main line underground/through the walls are corrupt. Root cause was never fixed by Comcast and resulted in it being cut off by apartment management 3 days back. Reason stated: Trip hazard to neighbors and violation of policy in running cables over the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nI scheduled an appointment with Comcast for yesterday, 12/20/2012 (2:00pm-6:00pm slot). I was a block away from home, when Comcast reached my home. I did tell customer care to wait for me 5 more minutes. But within 5 minutes, the technician went away. I made four calls yesterday to customer care at different intervals, only to be told that the dispatch unit will re-send the technician. At the end of the day (6:00 pm), I again called Comcast, only to be told that technician will not be coming over. I had to reschedule the appointment for today, 12/21/2012 (9:00 am-1:00 pm slot). Since I had to ** from work yesterday, I made my spouse to be at home today (she took an off day from work today).\r\n\r\nTechnician arrived at 9:30 am and my spouse explained the issue. He was unwilling to do any remediation and was rude with my wife. I was able to hear all conversation over the phone. I felt helpless and sad for my wife. I asked her to speak with his supervisor so to remediate the issue. Earlier, the technicians used to call up their supervisors and seek inputs. This technician did not heed to that request and simply walked to his Comcast vehicle and drove away. This is despite my wife pleading and requesting him to provide some help in reinstating Comcast service.\r\n\r\nI am deeply saddened and angry with such deplorable and inhumane approach that Comcast has, especially to a woman at home. I strongly feel this is racial discrimination and denial of consumer rights on a paid service. I would like to explore all options to take this forward if needed legally. As a formal step, I have lodged complaint with Comcast customer care. I am not sure if Comcast will be of any help in resolving the issue immediately. The apartment management clearly mentions that it's the responsibility of cable company to provide maintenance service to its customers. It also mentions that Comcast never made any attempt to reach out to the apartment management to resolve the issue.", "On the online email website for Comcast.net, Comcast creates (or allows) continuous flashing brightly-colored icons in basic shapes like squares or stars to blink on and off continuously. These shapes are large enough to be headache-inducing and profoundly aggravating. Undoubtedly the colors and continuous flashing are tested first on human beings to find the combination which sends rockets of pain into the temple. This is not normal advertising. And when you click on the advertising link to get rid of the flashing symbol, hoping to get at least a temporary reprieve of 10 or so minutes, you get the ad (of course). But when you go back to the email site, the flashing is still continuous. I am paying over $70 per month just for Comcast internet service. And while I understand that advertising is part of the game, why must I also pay for aggravation and a headache (which I actually still have as I write this). Really! I am paying for a service which assaults me.", "In June 2012, I ordered Comcast \"internet plus cable TV\" package for $36 a month with tax for 6 months. After the first two months, I still didn't have a working cable. I was told my cable box most be broken and they sent me another by mail with return shipping for the one I had already. I was told that my box wouldn't arrive until after the Olympic Games had finished. The Comcast representative then told me they would give me a free 10-day upgrade so I could stream the Olympics to my computer over my high speed internet. After the Olympics, I called to make sure my service was returned and to try and get my cable TV working. They sent over a technician who diagnosed a bad cable box. He tried to then connect the second box I was sent in the mail. Again he diagnosed this box as being faulty. He gave me a box from his van and I finally had working internet and cable TV.\r\n\r\nThe next month, my credit card bill was $160 from Comcast. When I called, they said my service was upgraded to premium or something and the monthly charges were $109. They also charged me for the technician who came out to fix my cable box. I explained that I never upgraded my service as they described and I was never told it would cost anything other than free. I also explained that the technician had to replace my broken cable box and that there is no way that could have been my fault. They refused to drop either the increased monthly rate or the technician visit. I canceled my service immediately to stop the reoccurring $109 monthly fee. My total bill from Comcast was $266 starting from the time they changed my service and started the increased billing rate.\r\n\r\nI called numerous times and did live chat at which point the Comcast representative always put me in for a refund as they agreed the charges were incorrect. I also went to my local Comcast store and, again, they agreed the charges were incorrect and put in for a refund. Every time, Comcast's Financial department denied the requests for a refund. I contacted my credit card company that Comcast had auto charged the money. I explained the problems and they requested my information and Comcast's. After reviewing the charges, they concluded that Comcast could not validate the charges and refunded the money. The credit card company's statement said that Comcast agreed the charges were incorrect.\r\n\r\nI am now receiving calls from a collection agency out of Boston for $266 that they say are from Comcast. I called Comcast and they said not to worry and to work it out with this agency. They have refused to help or negotiate the charges as it's out of their system. I now have a collection agency bothering me and my credit score will suffer.", "I have been paying $140 a month for a bundle service. The internet is supposed to be at 50 mbps. I run an average of 2-5 mbps since having the service. I don't have time to be dealing with this, but have still followed the technician's advice of changing out the modem and setting up an appointment for a visit. On the phone, Comcast claims that the only evidence of my internet not working is based on call logs of me calling in. The billing individual said that I was lying and that the problem pre-existed any phone calls I have made to Comcast. I tried explaining I don't have the time to deal with these problems... considering yesterday and today alone I have spent over 6 hours dealing with the problem that remains unresolved. \r\n\r\nThe evidence I have been paying for service I don't receive lies in the fact I have to have someone come out here to troubleshoot a more fundamental problem with my service, not in the phone call log. All I ask is that I am reimbursed for services paid for but not received, but Comcast refuses. There are few choices in terms of switching service and I need internet for my work. There must exist a remedy for this problem.", "After subscribing to Triple Play Services, I have had nothing but negative experiences with Comcast. The problem is that the company has grown into the largest cable provider in the world and its customer service has suffered. I attempted to use their self-install option, but after numerous calls, it was determined that I did not have service into my home. This was after several Comcast representatives assured me that I had service into the home. I scheduled an appointment for Saturday, but Comcast arrived on Friday morning instead. The technician left a note stating, \"No In-feed, requires Professional Installation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter calling customer service and speaking to four different representatives, I was advised that it would be a minimum charge of over $200.00 for professional installation. I now have an appointment for Sunday, but I will be returning their equipment to their technician and stopping my scheduled service. For some reason, these companies do not value the time of their customers, and for this reason alone, I will seek a better option.", "After three live chats and then two phone calls, still I have no resolution. They wanted to sell me something and then switch me to another agent to charge me for something that Xfinity should be taking care of. I am trying to access my email on my desktop and it keeps coming up access denied. It was fine a week ago. I am ready to go to another service provider. This is so frustrating. NO HELP!", "I have relied on Comcast's services for both my home and office. I can't use the internet at either. This has been going on today and yesterday. I have contacts that need to go out and I can't send them due to outages. This is costing me thousands of dollars and could be detrimental to my business. We also have payroll that we rely on intranet connection to complete. If the problem isn't resolved soon, people will go without paychecks tomorrow.", "Telephoned Comcast to order service on April 16, 2013. Informed Comcast that my move in date was May 1, 2013. A deposit was required and made to obtain a Bundle service. On May 4, 2013 received a bill asking for payment for one month. Telephoned Comcast and informed them that I had just moved in on May 1, 2013. Comcast informed me that statements commence on the date of order even though services are not provided. On May 1, 2013 a service representative came to my home to install services. While ordering phone, TV, and Internet, the installer only installed TV. Was informed that he had another appointment and had to leave. Leaving me high and dry.\r\n\r\nWhile the installer was at my home he broke a $300.00 figurine that was fifteen years old. Telephoned Comcast to advise of damage. A Comcast representative told me that a report would be written and the matter would be closed in three to five days. After three weeks, telephoned Comcast to ask for update on damage issue. At that time, the rep informed me that Comcast was not handling the matter and I should contact Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Each time when telephoning Liberty Mutual the agent was nasty and refused to assist me.\r\n\r\nFinally after a four-week wait Liberty Mutual told me that their company was a third party and would not pay for any damage. Liberty Mutual was told that I DID NOT BREAK the figurine the installer did. Telephoned Comcast and reported the discussion with Liberty Mutual to the CEO office and was informed that an executive would contact me to resolve the matter. Three days later a representative - not an executive - telephoned me and told me that Comcast was not going to help me even though they did receive confirmation that the installer did own up to the breakage of my figurine. A week later a check in the amount of $110.00 was received with a take it or leave it statement. Deposited the check and immediately cancelled services with Comcast as I will not deal with such a dishonest company.\r\n\r\nHow do you allow this Company to continue to do business? Comcast continually fabricates, increases payments without notification, does not adhere to agreed prices and denies or feigns no knowledge of what is told from one representative to another, and will not take ownership for what they do. Along with what occurred above Comcast billed for incorrect amounts and did NOT record payments paid. This all took place in a seven-week period!!!! This Company should NOT be allowed to continue to provide any type of so called service to the public. Thank you for allowing me to inform you of what takes place with Comcast.", "On Sundays, my internet speed drops to 2.2 download and 1.4 upload according to Speedtest.net. The rest of the week I am usually in the +20 download, +6.5 upload. Comcast's poor customer phone service routed through the Philippines always insists it is my equipment. US management agreed to run a test the day of the problem the next time I called, but you cannot get that message through their inept specialists overseas that answer the calls. How can you pay more and get less? Satisfaction guaranteed? No way. We really need competition to keep them honest in their claims or at least give us an option.", "I have switched to Comcast triple bundle package from a single service (internet), but problem occurred when I found out that I have been overpaying Comcast. When I called Comcast, they have told me that I have been charged with the single service (internet) I used to have because someone did not cancel my previous service, therefore, I have been paying double internet service fee. I have started the chain of command and I was able to talk with the operation manager and got some of the money back into my account. But, the problem still persisted when I saw my bill statement. The bill I received had $35 extra from what I have been quoted for. I was very irritated and angry, so I called Comcast again. \r\n\r\nWhen I spoke with the representative they could not do anything unless their supervisor approves it. Also, I have requested for the supervisor to call me but they did not call me back. In addition, one of the recent representative told me to pay up the delinquent fee and get the credit later. I was very frustrated when she told me that. I am still waiting from them to resolve the issue, but I am getting tire calling them and don't think this will be a easy one to resolve. Please help.", "We decided to try to get Comcast internet. Service guys were unable to connect because there were no viable outlets. The service call was voided; however we just noticed we have been charged $51.95 a month since March 4th, 2013 (the date of the service call) for non existent internet. The bill has averaged out to about $145.00 monthly. Now all of a sudden there is a $20.00 rate hike for Digital Preferred. What was $39.95 is now $59.95. This in addition to the charge for invisible internet has become ridiculous.", "A third party installer refused to do the installation, which was not complicated, and was rude and belligerent to the homeowner I rent from and myself. The records at Comcast were altered with incorrect information, stating he did not have permission from the homeowner - when the homeowner was PRESENT, and the customer service representatives and supervisors I have gotten to speak with have been extremely rude and do not believe me. My calls and requests to speak to management while the installer was at my home arguing with the homeowner have been erased. \r\n\r\nNo one wants to speak with the homeowner to verify the behavior of the installer. I have been called a liar basically. They should be doing everything in their power to make sure that this third party installer named Alfonso is never dispatched to anyone's home again. I will be cancelling my service if I cannot get some resolution with someone from management at Comcast. They seem to be a very arrogant company at this point.\r\n\r\nThey brag about their Guarantee but my experience so far is the customer really doesn't matter to Comcast, they just like to print nice words and advertise their kindness and customer care. They ruined an entire holiday weekend with the inconvenience and as a female who lives alone I now feel the need to get an alarm system in my home due to the fact that the creepy, dishonest, installer was in my home and knows where I live. \r\n\r\nThe only concession Comcast is willing to provide for all of this is a $29.95 refund of the installation fee. That is completely unacceptable and as I said, if that is all they are willing to do, I will cancel the service. There is not another internet provider in my area outside of satellite so I may ultimately end up moving so I can be in an area where I have more options than Comcast so I will not have to encounter them in the future.\r\n\r\nI was formerly a customer with Comcast for 18 years before moving to the country. It has been almost two years since I had access to their services and I do not remember Customer Service being this rude before. When I am in a situation where I have any other option I will never choose Comcast again. For now, I have no choices but to give them the opportunity to resolve my issue. We will see how much time I have to spend in the next few days trying to get that resolution. More than frustrating.", "Last two months, our internet service with Comcast cut in and out. They sent tech to our house. Some techs do whatever they want without our permission. One yell at us. One cut the cable. One cut the phone line. Two months later, our internet is still cut in and out, or no internet all together. Oct. 1, 2013, we transfer our internet from Comcast to Century Link. Century Link is only 12 MGB compare to 50 MGB Comcast advertised. We were wondering how slow our internet would be with Century Link. \r\n\r\nWhen we switch over from Comcast modem to Century Link, we are pleasantly surprised. The webs come right up. My internet game run a whole lot faster too. Today, we call Comcast to disconnect our service. I mention this to the customer service. She turns very hostile. I almost regret that we mentioned it, but someone should know. I hope our experience would help someone else choosing internet. Thanks for reading.", "My 84 year old mother was not able to access her Comcast email. She called Comcast support, was transferred to tech support, which actually was E-fix (a company in Salt Lake City). They gained remote access to her laptop and said it was all screwed up and would fix it for $200. My mother objected over the price and was told they would give her a senior discount ($135). She agreed then they uploaded anti-spyware and ran a 2 hr. upload and full scan. They called back, said laptop was fixed of all problems. The email still didn't work. Her account was charged $165. Myself, her son, has attempted numerous times to contact Comcast to resolve this to no avail.\r\n\r\nMany of the Comcast agents are unaware of this outsourcing and some think we were scammed by somebody outside their system. I have talked and chatted to many of their people who have escalated the problem but have not received one call back or email. In my mind Comcast is throwing people with problems to the vultures.", "We schedule service calls for our clients for Comcast to come out and do it right. No big deal, they would normally have something available the next day or so, at least that's what you've been told. When that appointment comes, no one shows up or calls. So we call them. They sometimes claim that they have no record of us setting an appointment. We would schedule it again the next day between 8-12. They don't show up until 6 pm without even calling. There were other jobs we had where we told them to call us prior to arrival because we can't afford waiting there all day. They showed up twice and left without calling us. We were 10 min away. From now on, I will let all our customers know the truth about Comcast.", "The \"Borg\" as we like to call them. After 8 years of paying them well over $200 a month for mediocre at best service, I moved to an area where (thankfully) Comcast does not rule. I called them to shut off service and we discussed that I would gladly return six pieces of equipment. Each piece was verified on the phone and the address to where I could bring the items. I am disabled so this meant I needed to enlist someone to take me to their main Borg ship on Plato Blvd. in Saint Paul (as instructed). How surprised I was to find that they no longer occupied that building. Myself and several other confused people were instructed to drop our equipment in the drop box. I was rather concerned but the person in line with me worked for Comcast and advised that they \"just junk it all\" anyway. \r\n\r\nSo, several days later I received an $800+ bill, which I had to call, sit on hold and wait to find out it was equipment charges as they never itemize \"new charges\". They advised me that they would update the bill and send a new bill just as soon as the equipment was logged as returned. 2 weeks later I get a bill that has the amount I owe $82.30 and some $ 25.00 mystery \"new charge\". I called and of course had no time to hold to find out what this was all about. Within 2 days of my receiving the bill, I get a collections call from Diversified collections, demanding $82.30??? Huh? So I call Comcast once again, to ask why I was turned over to collections two days after I receive my final bill and what the 25.00 is for? They advised me it was because of an un-returned router! Wrong! I work in telecommunications and I know that if they were charging me over $800 in equipment, the router would have been the most expensive part of that equation. \r\n\r\nSo either they are lying about the charge, lying about the real cost of the equipment and its value or just trying to squeeze more money out of me. Once again I had to reiterate the entire story of having to go to drop off equipment (with witnesses) and that I was not buying their story. I paid what was due and not a penny more. I am still receiving collection calls for the $82.30 and am now going to file a complaint, for all it will do with the millions of others to the BBB. Please!! If you live south of the twin cities do not let this monster in this territory! We have Mediacom, very similar but much smaller so easier to work with and no problems.", "I was texted by AT&T telling me my data for the month on my Apple cell was used up, due to my carrier Comcast. When I contacted them they told me because I had an Apple cell that was the problem and if I wanted the Wi-Fi working I needed a \"special code\" for $79.00. I finally cancelled Comcast and now fighting the early cancellation fee of &300.00.", "Filed complaint with the BBB. Outsourced customer service is inept & inefficient. Give the runaround & excuses instead of service. Had service connectivity issues for a long time. Each time I called, \"there was an outage\". The issues are consistent throughout the day; intermittent & stops every couple of minutes. A 90-min movie takes 3-4 hours to play out.\r\n\r\nI called March 19 to request a service technician visit, which was then scheduled for Friday, March 21. We had stayed home all day to accommodate the huge window of \"sometime between 12p-5p.\" We received a call about noon from the Service operators & were told a technician would arrive at 2:45p. We asked to receive a call when they were on their way. We received neither. No call, no technician. When I called later that evening, I spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service in Manila, Philippines... From 6:45p-7p, spoke to Robert who could not get my information correct, after repeating my number numerous times. I asked him to update my information, he did not. I asked to speak to a supervisor, spoke to Pao. \r\n\r\nHe gave the reason a technician did NOT come out because we didn't answer the phone when the technician called 3 times. We never received a call from a technician, & regardless, there was someone at the house the entire day. At 7:30p we were finally given an \"Escalated Ticket Report\" which \"guaranteed\" that a technician would call us back by 7:50P to schedule a visit the following morning-service ticket #**. We were reassured to call back if that didn't happen and speak to Pao directly. We received no such call.\r\n\r\nAt 7:55p, I call back & they had NOT updated my information to get through the long menu & maze of prompts. They had a number that had not existed for over 10 yrs which we have requested changed NUMEROUS times before, as well as over 10 times this same evening. Finally reached rep Dana. Seems no one at Comcast listens very well because she AGAIN asked me for my information numerous times. I asked to speak to Pao, she said that it was impossible because she didn't know who that was & there is no way to transfer calls, track, nor locate anyone in any way (he said he was a supervisor). I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager because I have been on the phone for over 2 hours & don't want to spend the entire evening on hold. She put me on hold & never came back. I hung up at 8:24p - that's THIRTY MINUTES ON HOLD with no follow-up.\r\n\r\nI called AGAIN at 8:24p, quite upset. I reached Nick. When I asked politely to speak to a manager because I have an issue that must be escalated, he disconnected the call without another word. We are paying $130/month for this service & this was NOT proper customer care at all. Relentless to resolve the issue, I called back yet AGAIN at 8:27p. Spoke to Kalhan who said we had no such \"escalated ticket report\" in progress. Took my number to \"call back in case we were disconnected\". Very nicely, she was \"scheduling a technician\", said it was the most urgent of requests, gave me a service #**. THEN she said it was a WAITING list for a POTENTIAL call from a technician by noon the next day, asserting that a call was NOT GUARANTEED. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager that could escalate it & give me something more precise. At 9:03,she disconnected the call.\r\n\r\nI waited 10 minutes for the promised call back in case of disconnection that never came. This seems to be a VERY COMMON practice at COMCAST. Called back at 9:13p; spoke to Hendrick who quoted the reason the technician didn't come was because there was a \"power outage\" (a different story than what previous excuses were) which cancelled service calls. He prepared yet ANOTHER ticket #**. Promised that we would get a call before midnight to plan the service visit the next morning. Promised follow-up callback in 3 hrs which never happened. This is a \"24-hour service\". I've now had contact with 6 service staff members who have done NOTHING but disconnect calls w/ no result.", "The internet service is always poor and overpriced. Not able to get the connection I have paid for. Customer service is cheap and with tons of recorded menus, feels like the goal is for people to give up and stop calling.", "X1 box locks up, no response to remote control, internet gateway restarts intermittently. TV picture pixelated so badly it can't be watched. Comcast's fix is \"reboot\" that fixes nothing.", "As has happened with others, I received a letter urging me to upgrade my modem. The letter stated, in the fourth paragraph: \"To protect our environment, please properly recycle your older modem... Please note that there is no unreturned equipment fee for your older modem.\" Then, on my latest bill, I received a monthly charge for this modem. When I called, I was essentially told \"Too bad, you have to return it or face monthly charges.\"", "We had Comcast service but I noticed that our bill almost doubled at one month. I paid that since I didn't have time to discuss with Comcast people. You know how painful is that since they really don't understand simple math. The next month, surprisingly, the bill quadrupled and I stopped paying that and service suspended for a month. Today, I tried to check the account and spend some time to solve the issue with customer service and, surprisingly, I noticed that Comcast has kept charging and overcharging us while the service was suspended. This is absolutely unacceptable. I wanted to contact the law office of our college to sue this company. They may have overcharged a lot of people as well and this is a big fraud.\r\n\r\n", "This is the post I put on my personal Facebook page 7-17-2014. I'm posting on the Comcast corporate Facebook page as a warning to anyone considering Comcast as an internet/cable provider. Also to offer legal proof that I am aware of my bill behind due 7-20-2014 but will not make a payment until my bill is adjusted correctly. Any attempt to charge me a late charge for not paying an incorrect and probably illegal charge will be documented also. I have given Comcast ample time to correct this error and have been met with total disregard.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I paid $120 to Comcast today 7-19-2014 which is less than they say I owe but more than I actually owe. I told them to put a note on my file that I was disputing the charges. Only time will tell if I'm charged a late fee or not. Well alright then, here is the scoop on my Comcast saga. It will soon become obvious why they have taken control of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE of any corporation in America.\r\n\r\n6-1-2014 @ 7:39pm - Called Comcast Customer Service (19 minute call) to report a problem with my internet and they scheduled a service call from between 8:00 and 10:00 am on 6-6-2014. 6-6- 2014 @ 2:00 pm the Comcast serviceman arrived 4 hours later than scheduled. Was unable to fix the problem, but was told I would have $20 credited to my account for them being late.\r\n\r\n6-7-2014 @ 9:38 am called Comcast back (26 minute call) to say I was still having problems with internet service. Was able to talk to an intelligent person who updated the router firmware which fixed the problem. He also, because of the problem the day before and the continuing problem that he fixed, offered to double my internet speed and lower my bill from $140 a month to $90 a month for a year. I agreed and checking on speakeasy found that my speed had, in fact doubled. 7-14-2014 Went online to pay my bill and it was for $267.95.\r\n\r\n7-16-2014 Drove to local Comcast office to discuss bill. Was told that they were unable to make any changes in the bill, but the girl did itemize the bill and said at least $67.75 was a double billing and was an error. She gave me a number to call. At 4:20 pm called Comcast billing (46 minute call), the first person I talked to said that the bill was correct and there was nothing they could do about it. When I mentioned the $67.75 double charge, they acknowledged it was an error, but said that they weren't authorized to fix it. I asked them to connect me with someone who was authorized to fix it. The next person was a little more helpful, but said that they were unable to do anything either and that I would have to talk to someone in Customer Satisfaction. The first thing this person told me was that the bill was correct and that I would have to pay it. When I asked her about the $67.75, like the other people before her, she acknowledged that it was incorrect, but she didn't have the authority to remove the charge. \r\n\r\nI went over the previous story about how I changed my service to get the lower rate and her response was, \"Well, honey, you are getting a significant discount for what you are getting.\" I told her that I was only interested in getting service for less than what I was already paying and not more. After 30 minutes I was able to finally get her to remove all of the extra services to where it was before, however she was unable to get the $67.75 removed. (WTH?)\r\n\r\n7-17-2014 After checking my bill today the charges had dropped to $176.25 which is still more than my usual bill of $140.00 and since I was somehow supposed to have an additional $20 removed for them being late on 6-6, they are charging me at least $50.00 over. I called Comcast again (19 minutes)and got someone who sounded like Garrison Keillor. (without being too prejudiced, I imagine him to be an Episcopalian carrying a Costco card). The first words from his mouth were, \"well sir, I see we've already given a significant amount of credits to your account.\" That was enough. I demanded to talk to one of his supervisors. He said wait a minute and put me on hold. Five minutes later he came back on and said a supervisor was about ready to talk. \r\n\r\nFive more minutes later he said that I should wait another day or two and that the credits should appear on my bill. I told him that I wanted it put on my account that if it wasn't below $120.00 by the time the bill was due that I was not going to pay anything and that I would be bringing my modem/router and cable box back to Comcast. He said he would do that.", "I cannot connect to internet and my equipment is fine. No problem there and my account balance is paid every month but Comcast's internet service is down most of the time. I have been a customer for a couple of years and I have complained to Comcast numerous times in the past but get no satisfaction. Now this time, the internet has been mostly down for a week and I can only use the internet for about 20 minutes a day if I am lucky. All my equipment is new and up to date just like Comcast ask me to do but I am still having problems. \r\n\r\nThis has been and is a common routine and Comcast does not give a damn. I am sick of paying for services that I cannot use and I cannot afford the installation fees for another company. I think customers should get some kind of notice and/or explanation for why service is down and when it will be up again and I think they should give customers some kind of credit for services they cannot and have not been able to use for a week or more.", "I have been waiting years for this service. It's not like I'm in bfe. So why can't I get service. This service should he available everywhere. Why? Please get service here..", "They started charging us per usage. It was fine at 300G a month. Then last month, it skyrocketed (even though we had one laptop, two iPhones and an iPad) which was less than the normal 2 laptops, on desktop. We don't use our wireless for our phones and make sure nothing is running in background. We have had these phones for over a year and never went over. We also had two desktops, two laptops, one iPad, and Netflix (no, it's not running unless we say ok to access), yet it jumped from 245G to over 365G within days. \r\n\r\nNow I suppose everyone must be a complete moron when it comes to calling Comcast. These customer service reps are usually from the Philippines. Not only is there service crap but they take away money to provide jobs to us in the US. Now it took almost a year and a half the first time we complained about slow internet. They sent guys out at least 4 times... Each one pretended they were going to fix it because I am just a female. They had no idea what they were talking about... I did... So after about 16 calls complaining and 4 different \"experts\" (you guys should really make sure these people know what they are talking about because the IQ together of these people you sent out was maybe 40). The last guy went out and checked the line. It had water in it (this was the first time). \r\n\r\nA year and a half later and at least 12 phone calls, another few guys come out. All were idiots... Minus the last one. He took off what you all used to use on the line. I can't for the life of me remember what it was called but it basically made sure we were not able to get above the speed we were promised (Sorry, I can't remember what it's called). He came back in and stated that he removed that cable block because they had not used that in years since they upgraded, yet ours was still there. Worked great for a while. Then Comcast got greedy.\r\n\r\nThey bought out Time Warner so they couldn't compete. So Comcast has monopolized an already crappy city. Living in the only place that hasn't been incorporated into Memphis. They charge what they want. Now I called them when we had gone over our 300g. Mind you again, we only had one computer (laptop), two iPhones (which we don't surf the internet on), and one iPad. When I called, I was told I needed to change my password because hackers can get into it. I am not an idiot. I know all about the hackers, identity, passwords, etc., etc. The guy I spoke with from Comcast was an idiot. He was also rude. Change your password...etc., etc. I can change the password constantly but if you are monitoring what I am using, shouldn't you be able to show what is using it?\r\n\r\nThey provided me with nonsense. I have a great virus/ad ware/security protection, Comcast said get a virus removal, change your password, sell your first born. Comcast, not everyone you deal with is an IDIOT. And again they could not tell me what caused our overage. I told them that considering I have LESS connected last month than the month before, there is no way in H(*& that we went over. This month, I have been the only one home (kids in school, husband at work, dogs do not use computers (unless they are really smart and play when I am sleeping!!!!), no iPads on, no iPhones on, no Netflix, and one laptop), yet I am at 145 G. BTW, we do not have cable with them, we do not have phones with them... It's just the modem. \r\n\r\nI had a program that showed me who was connected and it never showed anything that was not what was supposed to be connected. I believe Comcast decided to do this because they don't want to upgrade to handle the load. They throttle and/or they just decide to make it slow. Paying 80 dollars to watch how slow the internet has become or to get an \"it's busy\" is silly. My speed is terrible, I don't want to speak with someone in the Philippines. I almost forgot one night I called and spoke with someone from the Philippines. We were disconnected and I could not get back online. I called back, wasted another 45 minutes to be told that the last lady cancelled my service!!!!! Comcast is getting paid for bad service. Loading pages is the worst.. It's nonsense. If I pay you 80, I expect good service. You are throttling. You want me to pay over 100 for internet service because you monopolized the market here.", "I was going to launch a rant on the Comcast monopoly but, at my advanced age, I couldn't do better than J of Beaverton, OR.

They just wear customers down until they stop seeking regress.", "I only subscribed to internet with Comcast. Today, while paying my bill, I found out that they charged me $79 for only an internet connection. I called them up to ask why it's so expensive when the competition is half the price? The representative told me that I was getting charged for 2 modems and would take $5 off. I said, \"No, that's not what I am calling about. I want to know why am I paying twice with what the competition is paying?\". The person told me that Comcast upgraded my account automatically 5 months ago and now, I am getting basic cable with 22mbps internet. I don't have a television. \r\n\r\nI told him that I don't want a basic cable and just the internet and also why am I getting charged for 22mbps when my speed tests say I am only getting 6 mbps? He told me I can have a technician come to check out why I am not getting 22mbps. I told him I do not want 22mbps, I just want 6 but I want to pay my old price that I was paying for just 6 before. I never asked to be upgraded to a 22mbps cable bundle. He told me that if I were just to go on a basic internet only plan, it would actually be more expensive than $79 a month. He said there was nothing he can do to lower my price down from $80 a month for middle range internet service and he transferred me to a supervisor.\r\n\r\nThe supervisor answered the phone and I repeated my problem to her again. She said the same thing that the first person had told me. If I were just to get the middle tiered internet only service, it would become more expensive than the $79 I am paying now. I explained to her that AT&T offers a 12mbps (internet only) for $40 a month and if Comcast can't compete with that, then what's the use of staying with Comcast? She then said she can't do anything. I told her, then I'll just go with AT&T. Her response was \"okay\" and hung up.\r\n\r\nWorst customer service I have ever encountered. Not the fact that they didn't lower an extreme price for internet, but the attitude they expressed felt like they hate their jobs and hate the customers.", "My husband and I were signed up for an Internet for $19.99 for a year.  The first time they came out to install it, they tried to install both cable and Internet.  We refused the cable but they billed us for it anyway.  We called and they took it off our bill.  Six months later, we get billed $34.99 for Internet.  I called and was told that we had a different promotion, wherein the rates would eventually raise to $40 a month.\r\n\r\nWhen I got fussy, they told me that I wasn't authorized to speak to them about the account.  I asked for a direct line to customer service and they said that there was none so I had to call the main line.  I found the direct line to customer service on the Internet, called back and was told that the rates would eventually rise to $60 a month!  Comcast has a monopoly on Internet here on Ft. Meade, and their shoddy customer service will hopefully make the company go bankrupt.", "I was unable to access some websites for the last 4 days.

On 11/18, I had Comcast install it.  So, they clearly should have seen it was not fixed!  I called today and this lady Angie only wanted to argue that because he logged in, I could not get my money back.  He was in there around 10 minutes and got out.  The problem was not fixed.  It did the same thing later.  I want my $98.95 back from Comcast for poor representation of their products and for not doing what their seller told me who got me to sign up.

We had nothing but problems with phone, internet and xfinity connections. I was on the phone almost every day for months. Techs came to the house and set up more equipment, rearranged equipment, replaced equipment and blamed each other for the poor job done by the previous tech. On one occasion, a tech, whom I spoke to over the phone, had me do a total reconnection service myself.\r\n\r\nI questioned a Voice Service fee on my September statement in the amount of $50.00 and was told it was for the tech who replaced the wires. When I scheduled each service call, I questioned a fee and I informed that I would not pay for the service call. I was told I wouldn't be charged due to my ongoing connection issues. They are refusing to give the refund now because they are saying that the wires in the house are old. In 2006, Comcast was the company who initially set us up, connected all the necessary wires to begin with. We didn't have a problem before we disconnected Last October! \r\n\r\nSo the excuses from Comcast have been from working in the area on changing the system, updating issues with the equipment, and  that we have old wires. The second issue with Comcast is, I owed them $109.39 from October and was billed on Nov 7th, 2011 for $164.19 due on Dec 7th. They are saying I am over 50 days overdue on $282.32. I was told they sent a disconnection notice in an envelope which does not show who it's from, so, I didn't open it until today, December 4th. \r\n\r\nI throw mail out that does not disclose the sender. I thought it was junk mail in fact, I tossed it and for some reason I took it out of the recycle to open it. There was the notice. How responsible is the company for this?

After their decision to outsource technical services and establish a complaint deterrent automated system, the level of incompetence and total disregard for customers has been a nightmare for over five years. I am a retired divorcee who survives on a restricted income and I faithfully pay Comcast $143.20 each month before the due date. </p>\n<p>In December 2010, I purchased a bundled service package with Comcast that included cable, internet, and telephone services.

In retrospect, I also have ADT security services and whenever the telephone is disabled, my security services are also disabled. Since June 17, 2011, I intermittently had no telephone and Internet services for extended periods which ranged from 2 to 24 hours. Initially, I felt these problems were related to some strange power surge and was reluctant to complain. However, after experiencing 2 to 24 hour disruptions between July 11, 2011 and July 18, 2011, I requested a service call. </p>\n<p>After being placed on hold for 20 minutes, they finally dispatched a technician who arrived at 2:10PM and adjusted the wire outside and replaced the Comcast modem. He was unable to ascertain the source of the problem and left at 5:45PM. At 6:10PM, the internet and phone were off again. I have placed nine service calls, spoken with numerous supervisors, written to the CEO and the issues have not been resolved as of July 19, 2011. Thus, I am seeking restitution of fees paid for services that were not rendered. After reviewing the numerous complaints from almost every state, it is obvious that this company needs closer scrutiny and oversight. 97% of the 132 complaints received between October 16, 2010 and July 14, 2011 were related to billing practices and disruptions which are not regarding unpaid accounts. </p>\n<p>Gale- Richmond, VA</p>\n", "<p>My high speed internet and telephone service stopped working.

The soonest it would be was three days away. I was offered the option to take my modem to their office and exchange it. When I went to their office, I received what I thought was another modem. Wrong! All they did was replace the battery. My modem was still bad. I returned this modem a second time and received another modem. The people on the activation line at Comcast could not get the new modem to work. I then called the Comcast High Speed Internet tech support number.

I called Comcast to inquire about the service going forward. I explained that we were not traveling right now, so were not using the Internet To Go service at that time. I asked if I could discontinue the service and reactivate it when we were again traveling and if I would need to sign another 1 year agreement. The sales representative said that I needed to call back because my contract hadn't expired yet but that yes I could re-activate it when we needed it again and that it would be month to month. So I called back on the date they told me and deactivated it and again made sure I could re-activate it month to month.\r\n\r\nYesterday, March 28, I called to re-activate it, that is less than 2 months later, and I was told the service is no longer available to anyone who wasn't currently paying for it because they had signed a new service agreement with Verizon to supply Internet To Go. Quite frankly I was not happy. I would never had discontinued the service if I had been told I could not sign up again. Now I have a useless portable modem and no way to connect to the Internet while traveling. I have spoken to someone from another wireless company who said they always inform their customers who are making changes to their service if that service will not be available to them should they want it again and if the price will increase.\r\n\r\nComcast is treating their Internet To Go customers very badly.

On the fourth call, I was told by an individual that the call had come to a \"fee-based area\" of Comcast and that I had to pay upfront $49.00! I was shocked by this method of Comcast to collect money for a problem that has originated from Comcast. I vehemently declined to pay a cent. \r\n\r\nI tried another call, this time asked for the supervisor and the rep said the \"manager has gone home\".

From past experience, I told him that people in the foreign-located offices never call USA customers to settle a problem. He lied as I have so far not received a call.

On 11/5/2011, when my service was installed, I noticed the speed is 1.5 Mbps, and not 3 Mbps. I called Comcast and spoke with operator ID **. I was told that there must have been an error, and they don't offer 3 Mbps for that price.

I spoke with the supervisor, but he didn't help at all telling me that's what's on their conversation history note.\r\n\r\nThey lied to me twice; once when I signed up, and the second time on the first date of service, when I called to complain about the speed and bumped up my plan. I have to pay $39.95 for the 3 Mbps if I want to continue using their service now.\r\n", "Roughly about a year ago, I wanted to try the 3G or 4G to go, so I signed a contract of a year with Comcast. I was very dissatisfied with the service. I mean, it was just terrible. I only attempted to use it about 6 to 7 times and every time I tried using it, it was very slow and it would freeze especially in the highway. So I went personally to the Comcast office around Christmas time to cancel the service, but I was told that if I canceled before the year of the contract that I agreed to, I would have to pay the full amount of whatever the device was worth. So I had no choice but to keep paying for the stupid service. So when the time was up, I went personally to the office to cancel the service for the 3G or 4G to go. \r\n\r\nLo and behold, I was in for a surprise. The service that I was paying for was no longer available. The office worker had mentioned to me that it had been a while since Comcast had the service because of so many complaints. So I wanted to speak to a manager so that I could get a refund for paying for something that was no longer available through Comcast. I also learned that I had to return the device to Comcast even though I was faithfully paying for the service throughout the whole year. I will pursue further action if I don't get a response from Comcast or receive what is rightfully mine. I would like a manager to please call me asap. I'm not going to pay my bill until I get answers and the refund that I'm entitled to. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.", "Incompetent service installation - Three months ago, I called to ask if I could split a cable to a second home on my property. I was told by Comcast that that would be considered theft because it was a separate address. Fair enough. An installer came to connect the other service, but used a two-way splitter at the pole dividing my signal with the other home. A line was laid on the ground across the driveway for a temporary connection. The new splitter was installed without the ground wire, leaving a lightning damage hazard. After several calls and missed appointments over several months, a service technician came to the property and disconnected my service, leaving the ungrounded temporary line still lying across the driveway. \r\n\r\nAfter 5 or 6 calls being promised a technician to come back out, and that a supervisor would be contacting me within 2 hours (promised 3 times, no call), I finally got to talk to a supervisor who scheduled a service call in two days, and a credit of $40.00 (slightly more than one week of service). Really! If I had connected a splitter, it would have been theft of service. When they did the same thing and billed both of us for full service, it was a minor inconvenience.\r\n", "I wanted to get internet service from Comcast cable services. I checked myself the availability of the Comcast service at my address and got the answer online that the service is available. So the next day, I called on the number 877-417-0922. My call was, after some time, answered by a person who called himself Kenneth. After taking all my information, he told me that I will get internet service at $29.99 and a free router and modem. Then he said, \"you will pay for the two said devices and you will get the paid amount back as a rebate\". After this, he said \"you will have to pay for the shipment $19.99\". Then he said, \"you will not get the shipment amount back\". The total amount he made was $199.93. He took all my credit card information. There was not enough amount in my bank so I offered him another card and told him to get the total amount from the two cards. He told me that I will pay double shipment if I have to use two cards for payment. I did not want that so I rushed and deposited some cash in the bank to make the payment from one card. \r\n\r\nAfter making the payment, he started offering me more of his offers from AT&T security and tried to connect me to the AT&T security people. I told him that I have been on the phone for about two hours and I was late for my job, I will do that tomorrow. So then he connected me to the installation department to setup the date for installation. The man who talked to me from the installation department called himself Steve, told me that my computer shows that Comcast service is not available at my address. After too much discussion, he told me that I should cancel my order from the sales department. So I called back to the sales department and found on the phone a person called William. \r\n\r\nWilliam told me that the installation department people may be confused and that we have the service in that area and connected me back to installation department. This time, I found another person called Espo. Espo said there is no service at my address. I tried to reach Kenneth, the first person whom I had talked and who had taken all my credit card information to cancel the deal, but I could not get to him. When I reached for my job, I was two hours late. At my job, my cell phone started ringing. I had told Kenneth that I am unable to pick any call when at my job. I tried to call back, but nobody picked my call. \r\n\r\nThe next day, I got a message from my cell phone company that I have used all my minutes and I need to refill my account. The next day, I called the number 877-405-5035 and talked to a lady whose name was either Rem or Allisan. She told me that I still can get the rebate. She told me to fill the forms online and send it for rebate. The form for rebate was asking for the date of installation, but I haven't been given the date of installation by the Comcast people because they are not going to install the service to me. There is much more to say because I have talked to some other people in Comcast. Please do not do this. Please be truthful.", "Two years have passed and I still have not received my netbook promised to me for signing up. First, it was \"didn't pay bill on time.\" When that turned out to be false, it was \"didn't sign a contract.\" Bad, bad people.", "I tried to get hold of Comcast installation department and went through CSR and supervisor but to no avail. They do not have any info in regards the installation crew nor do they have a telephone number and/or an email. I had a Comcast technician climb my 6-1/2 ft. fence (because the gate was locked and I was home at the time and no one tried to let me know that they needed to get into the back yard). Also, the access to the poles that were needed was on another property and not mine. I do not have Comcast so I was pretty upset as there is a reason for the locked gate; we have a pool and also two dogs (good thing they were not out at the time). He was there with another technician who eventually knocked on the door (I think) as I didn't hear him.\r\n\r\nThe dogs let me know and when I confronted him about his partner already being in the yard and how he got into the yard, he said he didn't know. Needless to say, they took down my birdhouses and did not put them back up. I had a doctor\u2019s appointment. My husband who came home to take me opened the gate for them and advised them that they could be charged with trespassing, unlocked the gate and told them not to do it again. But this was the 2nd time that I had a confrontation with Comcast. A month ago, another technician proceeded to let himself in our yard and when confronted, he told me that if I cut my bushes, there would be no need for him to come into my yard. Needless to say, the bushes belonged to the neighbor whose cable he was working on. \r\n\r\nMy daughter had a problem also. Her neighbor had cable installed and they went right through the middle of her yard instead of the right of way and needless to say, the neighbor had a problem when they needed to run a tiller on their yard for tree stumps. Rest assured Comcast did use the legal right of way when they had to replace the chopped up cable. You would think that a company as large as this company would have something on their website pointing to complaints.", "If you want a truly dissatisfying experience, get internet service from Comcast. My service was out 24 days in August and they came out to my location four times. Each time, the internet would work for a brief period then go back out. It got so frustrating being on eternal hold while you waited to get through to a supervisor that I gave up. Fortunately, my T-Mobile phone service had hotspot capabilities, so I was able to use my tablet to surf the internet and do my reports for work. On the third time they came out to my location, my wife was home and the guy told her the cable to the entire neighborhood was out when in fact he was too big to access the crawl space. So, he told her he would call it in on Tuesday when he returned to work. \r\n\r\nMind you, it was Saturday afternoon. It's a technology company. Why would it take so many days to report the problem? I called Monday and put in another service call and the same technician came back. Rather than lie to me and tell me the crawl space was too small for his rotund self, he ran another cable on the outside of my house. Now I have a cable sticking out of the siding at my front door. He also had another technician come over to supposedly help him with the install when in fact they were just running their mouths. The cable went out again and I called to speak with a supervisor and was on the phone for over 1 hour with no resolve, just a bunch of promises to be called back. \r\n\r\nMy uncle died that Friday and I went to NY for the funeral. They called me while I was in NYC walking into the funeral home, so I cancelled the appointment and asked to just reschedule it for a later date and never heard anything from them again. For the next two weeks, I used the internet on my phone and said to hell with Comcast. I then had three deaths all on Sept. 14, 2012 and just let the internet go to the wayside. I finally had the time and mentally capacity to deal with them again so I called today, October 8, to pay my bill and ask for credit for the month of August for which I had no service. After paying the bill, the representative was extremely rude and told me they only offer credit for the days between when you call and the day they come out. My service is still intermittent, but I don't have the patience to deal with them anymore. I'm going to find another provider and hope that they are a little more professional than Comcast. \r\n\r\nThey should record every call they get and give the customer a reference number for the call at the beginning, so that when the customer has a complaint, they can submit the reference number for that call. The representatives as well as the customers can be held accountable for what was said. Without some form of accountability, this will go on and on because they may be the only reasonably priced providers in that particular area. For now, I am stuck but I am diligently looking for another provider. Who cares if you come out within two days of calling if the problem is not ultimately resolved? Be professional and take pride in what you do. Know your job and if you don't have the answers, at least know the resource where you can get the answers from.", "I called to get help with an internet modem wireless signal loss. Comcast placed a wireless modem in my house for me. We are constantly losing wireless signal. I called to find out what to do and was told that I had to pay to talk with a technical expert. I pay $150.00 per month for service and they want me to pay to talk to a technician. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor called me back and was extremely rude and made veiled threats about disconnecting my service. I hung up on the supervisor. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The issue is still unresolved.", "If internet service wasn't needed, I would have said good riddance to Comcast a long time ago. But since there are very few alternatives, I will remain a hostage of terrible customer service, awful download speeds (that is understandable since I pay for the fastest speeds possible), moronic website and excuses up the gazoo. Did I mention how much I despise Comcast? And too think this is 2013 and we are still living in an industrial infrastructure. Crumbling bridges, roads or should I say potholes that pass for roads? It's time for this country to catch up with the rest of the world so that when the wind blows, we still have internet service.", "I have had endless issues with Comcast since I started using their services. The most recent and most outrageous incident occurred this month. There are many complaints that I have:\r\n\r\nFirst, we have complained multiple times that our internet is extremely slow and that we think it may be the modem that Comcast provided to us. They have sent technicians over and they suggested changing our router. So we bought a new router for $80 (the one they recommended) and it didn't change a thing. They refused to admit that it was the modem. Our internet would be down for days at a time! And coincidentally, when we called for a technician to come, it would start working the day before they were scheduled to come. Coincidence? I think not.\r\n\r\nRecently, our internet was down for 3 days during the time Comcast was changing to faster download speeds. So we called a tech to come out and fix the problem since they were not able to fix the problems over the phone. So the tech said that the modem (the one that Comcast provided to begin with) was not compatible with the new download speeds. What?! So he switched out the modem and tried to leave before the internet was working. So we said, \"Um, excuse me, it's not fixed.\" The tech then stated something might be wrong with the router (lame excuse for not following through and completing his job). Our router works just fine; mind you, it's the brand new one we just bought. So we gave it some time to link up with the modem and finally the internet started to work!\r\n\r\nNow, prepare yourself for this one! The next bill came and there was a $50 additional charge for a tech to come out and swap out their faulty equipment. The customer service agent said that he couldn't do anything but take off $25! This is absurd! Why am I paying for your faulty equipment? This is by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Comcast has fraudulently charged me for their own defective equipment and I will be cancelling my service with them and potentially filing a lawsuit and complaint for the grief they have put me through in the past 6 months.", "My first 24h as a Comcast customer:\r\n\r\nI called the local representative, on the advice of the building I am renting from, where I received the guarantee that I had the best deal. He charged me a price higher than what was available online and set up a connection inferior to the one I paid for, as well as was slow and discourteous in his communications. I first contacted Comcast's live chat to address this. The person was unhelpful, rude and terminated the chat, not wanting to change anything even though I didn't even get the plan I paid for. I then contacted Comcast on the phone. The 2nd person I spoke with finally fixed these 2 issues, but sent me to tech support because my speed tests were not up to what I had paid for. \r\n\r\nFinally, this issue was resolved by tech support. The day goes by, I noticed significant problems trying to stream video content at a high resolution, with a high amount of stuttering - a problem I didn't have at my previous ISP. I look things up and indeed the content was being throttled by Comcast: (a) their support forums discussed extensively how this was a recurring issue for streaming with Comcast; (b) this problem was independent on my hardware as I previously had no issues and the remainder of the internet worked; (c) my girlfriend, who still had the previous ISP, had no problems; and (d) the problem resolved through the use of a VPN that prevented Comcast from monitoring traffic. \r\n\r\nI spent 2 hours on the phone speaking with 5 different people to resolve this issue. Most people did not understand what I was talking, as they weren't particularly tech savvy despite being technical support. The last person that I spoke to about this became very quiet very suddenly when confronted with the evidence. Frequently, tech support would try to get me to sign up to a signature Comcast tech support that charged over $30 just to sign up, in addition to a $5-6 monthly fee, which is ludicrous and infuriating. It is interesting to note the FCC fined Comcast for throttling their customers' internet only within the last few years.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, in 24h, Comcast's employees were dishonest about their offers, bait and switched my service, were rude and unhelpful when I tried to address them, made things extensively difficult to resolve and then tried to not only cover a blatantly illegal practice, but tried to again engage in dubious behavior to charge me for a service I don't need.", "Attempted to transfer service from my old address to my new address. I was quoted a price on the phone, wrote the price down, and agreed to the price. Based on the quote, I passed up opportunities for discounted service for satellite service, offered to people moving. First bill comes, and the price is higher than my previous bill (for the same service), and significantly higher than the quoted price. Comcast denies their original price, continually states that their stated price was \"not something they offer\", and says they will need to review the previous call recording and contact me. \r\n\r\nThey fail to do so, and upon contacting them, they will not address the previous call recording, although I suspected it had been reviewed. After multiple calls and several hours I offer to mail their legal department my copy of the original call - which they stated they were recording - and which my cell phone had recorded as well. Suddenly I get something slightly better than the original quoted price and phone service added. Comcast had already confirmed multiple times that there was no way for me to get this offer. I know they sometimes offer a discounted \"triple-play\" price that is less than internet + TV combined - there was no confusion, this offer only came AFTER I stated I had a recording of the original call.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of my calls, I was abruptly dumped to collections by employees who did not even collect basic information. Why? The installer hadn't filed the correct paperwork when returning equipment he had collected during installation. I had no idea my account showed a $600+ charge for the equipment, I was just treated like a deadbeat. I only realized THEIR mistake when my second bill arrived, and the equipment charge was listed. I had to wait for that charge to be removed from my account before anyone would even discuss their other mistake in our agreed upon price.\r\n\r\nWhy am I writing this today? Because my service today is intermittently failing. I work for a big networking gear company. Their modem is broken. I know tier 1 support doesn't know that, so I followed their directions politely. I patiently spent time on the phone, again, and now I get to wait two days for a service call. They did ask me to call them back to reduce my bill once the service is corrected. I have no idea why that can't be done without me calling, yet again. \r\n\r\nThey need ME to tell THEM when the service is restored? And not charging for something they're failing to deliver is really the law, not customer service. I wasn't given the option to switch the service to another time. Why would they even worry about whether Sunday was a good day for me? They've already treated me like a deadbeat and a liar, without apology, when the errors have all clearly been on their side.", "Yesterday I was to receive a call from a Comcast service technician that was to walk me through the step so that I may replace the \"lost/dropped\" emails in my Comcast.net account. That did not happen. This morning I rec'd a call from Comcast, Jacksonville, FL stating they were just placing a follow up call. I stated \"Follow Up\" from what, no one called. One of the previous service calls had me change my passwords so they could work on the system. They provided me with a new password and locked me out of my old password. \r\n\r\nI was to wait 24 hours and a technician would walk me through what I needed to do on my side. She stated that none of those directions were applicable... REALLY. She stated that there is no clear way for Comcast to say they could retrieve the emails they lost/dropped in September. Does anyone know any more about the process of recovery, why or what I need to do and WILL I get back my emails? NO real service, fix to problem since Sept 21. HELP.", "I was so dissatisfied with my bill, I contacted customer services. I was cut off several times and when I provided my phone number for a \"call back\", once I answered the phone, another cutoff. After over an hour trying to reach them, I finally got a voice. The person told me they would refer me to Customer Resolution. After I spoke with a guy for less than 2 minutes, he claimed that my telephone number wasn't on file. He then asked for my address and when I provided it to him, he hang up. This was a nightmare of over 2 hours. The next day I went to the COMCAST office, and they told me my problem couldn't be resolved there and only recited my bill again to me. I had enough of their lying and terrible customer services. I am going to cancel COMCAST and end this nightmare with them.", "I have been having an issue with Comcast since Aug 5 and still at the same place today (Dec 3) as when I first started complaining. It started when I was working from home on a Monday and took a break and stepped outside when I saw my neighbor. While we were talking she received a call from her daughter and she went inside. Moments later we both walked outside because my internet and her phone both were shut off. From that day on I have been getting slower than dial up service paying for Blast (50 mbps). I have called a number of times always to get the same the thing it's your equipment, it's your router, it's computer. \r\n\r\nWell, after spending $2,000 on a new router, computer, and tablet we are still experiencing the same problem before spending any money. I have seen seven different techs (all same something different as to why my internet service is acting the way it is) that I have had to take off work, reschedule my day, and I am fed up with wasting my time. It has been 4 months and I need help getting Comcast to realize it might be their messed up equipment. This is a new housing development. With Comcast having the monopoly in the area it is hard to get what some would say an end to the madness.", "My complaint call started on Jan 8 due to internet service so slow (3-9 versus 50mbps) during the holiday weeks. They took 4 days to fix the problem; however, on Monday Jan 13 the problem is back. In the meantime, they refused to give the BLAST expensive service credit for the month of December and now spilling into Jan.", "I called Comcast on December 15th to let them know that we were moving and to shut off our service on December 23rd. As usual the Comcast customer service agent that I talked to was not American and their command of the English language was not perfect. A couple of weeks later after moving I took their cable TV boxes back. Then I get a bill in the mail for service owing for January and more for February. So I call them back and I get the gal from India (or wherever) again, who tells me that they thought that I was moving my service to a new address. After going round and round with her, she had me wait on-hold for at least 20 minutes until a bona-fide American \"account executive\" could get on the line, who told me that I had never made a shut-off request, even though their non-native customer service agent had just told me that my shut-off request had been misinterpreted by them. \r\n\r\nSo they refused to give me any credit for telling them to turn my service off until after the date that I turned their equipment back into them, claiming that I never told them to shut off my service. What obviously happened was that their foreign-based customer service worker misunderstood me, and Comcast's official response is that I should have called back to make sure that my first call was received accurately. So just so that we all know, either make at least a couple of follow-up calls to Comcast just to make sure your first calls weren't misunderstood by their second-rate foreign customer service workers or be ready to pay Comcast for extra service costs. Thanks but no thanks, Comcast. I won't be needing that run around ever again.", "Internet locks up, after calling Comcast the service goes to working fine. My wife witnessed this after I got off the phone with them and the internet locked up again. They said it was my computer, lies lies lies. This happens many times on a consecutive basis and they are in denial about the service. I have proof that the fiber optic light is being split as one line goes to comcast and the other to the FEDS.. DATA manipulation is what is going on. This is wrong, this is a service we are paying for and it's costing a lot of money for the Delusional feds to abuse the consumers this way.", "My feedback on Comcast/Xfinity is that it sucks!!!!! The customer service is horrible, and nobody seems to know what they are doing. I was on live chat with a girl earlier today and she literally took 6-7 minutes in between each question that I asked her only to come back not answering the question at all. I got so frustrated with her that I disconnected with her and called in. The people in the billing department were just as rude and horrible. I was told since I got your service in December that my installation fee of $66.50 was only for 3 months which I paid and it shows that on my paper. However, today a lady told me that she don't know who told me that because my installation for $66.50 is for 6 months. Like WHERE THE HELL did that come from? After arguing back and forth with her I decided to do what was best and CANCEL my services. I can't keep dealing with LIES from Comcast representatives/Comcast in general. Not only are they RUDE but NO ONE seems to know what they are doing!!!!!! OH AND DID I SAY RUDE, RUDE, RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BILLING DEPARTMENT!", "This is the third time in a month that I've had a negative experience with Comcast. The first time was when I was moving, had an issue, called them twice, sat on hold, got hung up on, and then the same thing happened again the following week. I am now unable to access my email even though I never changed my password and they told me a technician would call me from 5-9 last night, never called, and I have no email.", "I was billed incorrectly in May of 2014 for 399.99 first installation charge. I HAD NO NEW INSTALLATION. MY XFINITY HOME WAS INSTALLED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2013 AND PAID FOR! I have repeatedly contacted Comcast several times a week, have been transferred, left on permanent hold and hung up on, promised credit several times, promised call backs. I can't believe they can get away with this! Someone has to be able to do something about them... Please!!!", "I began having issues with my internet from day 1, but recently was the best of the worst. I had issues for about 15 days straight, and had 'bullets' sent to my modem at least once a day. So about 10 days ago a tech came over. Now since I disconnected my modem overnight the stupid thing decided to work when the tech connected it. I asked for a replacement since it was at least 10 years old and he wouldn't so it wouldn't come up as a service call which made no sense at all. Today I called, wasted 35 minutes and tomorrow they will replace it, only because I didn't want to waste my time driving 20 miles round trip, or want to pay a fee to have it mailed. Why would I pay a fee when they told me it\u2019s an outdated piece of equipment. I am paying good money plus insurance to have proper service. You want me to go pick it up? Have it closer to me. Comcast is the worst. I am seriously thinking about FiOS just to get some upgrades for a few years. By then maybe some good from NY might come down.\r\n", "The network keeps dropping me at 30 minute intervals. It's difficult to stream anything because the router needs to be reset 2-3 times every night. So frustrated at the audacity of Comcast to claim to be the best internet provider when they don't deliver.", "My phone service has been out since April 13 and my wireless is not working. I called on the evening of April 16 and the rep tried to send signals and it didn't work so he said we needed a service call and asked if Tuesday would work - I said no. He said, \u201cHow about Wednesday?\u201d I said yes, and he said \u201cBetween 8-10am?\u201d I said, \u201cPerfect. I take my child to school and will be home by 8:15.\u201d He never gave me a date so of course I thought it's today - but no, it's next Wednesday, the 25th.\r\n\r\nI would have never agreed to wait a week and a day for the service call. So I have stayed home waiting for 2 hours this morning for nothing! Do the reps need to make sure and triple check with the customers on the date and time? Now I'm on a waitlist. I have to wait and hope a technician either gets a cancellation or gets some extra time, and will call me to see if it's a good time to come by. If not, I have to wait a week. I am not happy about this situation at all!", "Last March I opened a business internet account with a static IP with Comcast. The only reason that I needed a business account/static IP was that my wife needed it per her employer at the time. The situation was that I took a new job in Memphis and my wife moved with me from California. At the time, she was allowed by her California employer to work remotely but was told she would need a static IP in order to connect with the company network. The only way that Comcast will provide a static IP address is with a business account.\r\n\r\nA few months after moving here, my wife's employer decided that the long distance thing was not working out and my wife had to look for a new job. When this first happened, I contacted Comcast to see what my options were in regards to dropping the static IP and the commercial account, and switching over to a residential account for personal use only. I was told that they could drop the static IP without penalty but that I would be responsible for the full term of the business contract which was 36 months. When I first talked to Comcast in regards to opening this account, I was under the impression that the term was for one year which is all I would ever agree to, under the circumstances. \r\n\r\nWhen I signed the service order, I did not notice that it was for 36 months. I just checked the agreement real quick to ensure that the monthly charges were as agreed to and signed it. That was my mistake but at the time I was scrambling to get moved that I got a little careless. So, we did drop the static IP and I decided that I would just live with the higher commercial rate for my personal internet access. Now, we are moving from the apartment we live in to a duplex in another part of town where the landlord pays for internet access, so I need to cancel the service in its entirety. However, I am running into a brick wall. The customer service reps tell me that I will have to pay a penalty which amounts to $1318 which I cannot afford. I also do not believe that I am responsible for this either.\r\n\r\nI have read the Terms and Conditions which state that this penalty will be charged if the customer terminates service without cause. In the section regarding termination for cause, it lists termination of business as cause which I am positive my wife's situation qualifies for. So, I should be able to cancel without penalty. So it comes down to this. The original business needed for a static IP and thus a business account no longer exists. The need for any internet service is not required as I am moving and internet is provided at the new location. Based upon this, I believe that I should be able to disconnect without penalty.", "I contacted Comcast by phone in mid-February to request that the overpayment be immediately deposited back to my bank account. The agent said that she would ensure that the request is logged in the system and forwarded to the right department to process, but it may take 6 weeks. I have called several times asking for the status. They have notes in the system reflecting the request, but can not give me a reason for the delay or better timing. I called last week (9+ weeks) and was told by the agent that she would escalate the request and someone would call me within 72 hours to help. \r\n\r\nToday, I went to the local Comcast office to cancel service and asked for my refund. The customer service agent said that she would email the refund department in Atlanta. I told her that I appreciated that, but considering the delay to this point, I would prefer that she calls. She told me that she did not have their number and has done all that she can do. I requested to speak with a supervisor, but was told that she is in Tennessee. I asked if we could call, but was told that she is on vacation. I asked how can we escalate this since I have made several attempts and have not received any follow through.", "When choosing an internet provider, I liked the Comcast's price and the service. I spoke with a sales rep from the company, Lyn **, and she told me that the transfer process from Century Link would be \"seamless\" and our services will be down for a max. of about 5 min and that we would have to cancel our Century Link Internet (I have e-mail record). The tech came to switch our phone numbers and added cable internet. He looked at our system and said, \"I cannot touch that phone system\" (it is a POPP system). \r\n\r\nI was baffled because I informed Lyn that we had a POPP phone system. He informed me that we would need to hire a phone tech to work while another Comcast tech came. This cost us an additional $150 and totally wasted my day because I had cleared my afternoon to assist the tech. We had the phone tech come out and the Comcast tech (who was 10 mins late) and set up our phones and internet. All was fine. No problems other than the tech messed with my routers and killed our database for good. We have a domain name and we use the domain for our e-mail. \r\n\r\nI came to work on Monday after the switch and found out that we were still using Century Link internet servers for our e-mail. I thought, \"Great. I will pay for both services and switch the domain name from Century Link during the weekend when we will have no e-mails going through, thus making the switch seamless.\" Well, to my surprise, when I came in to work on Wednesday, Comcast had suspended our services from Century Link (without our permission) and we had no e-mail server/service. \r\n\r\nI am in the sales business and no e-mail means no orders received. I called Comcast and they said, \"No problem. We will just add your domain to your account.\" Great. He walked me through setting up the vanity domain name and then instructed me to go through our host server (**) and have them add our new, **, and target value. The process was supposed to take 24 hours, but could take up to 48. Not so great. After 24 hours, I called the Host to ask if all the information was \"propagated\" and the tech said, \"It should all have been sent sometime last night.\" So, he said it is Comcast who was in error. \r\n\r\nThe blame game begins. I call Comcast and they say that it has to be the Host who has not sent the information. After about 7 phone calls and 4 hours, I finally got a manager to talk to at Comcast, Jason out of the Denver office. He said he would call the host company and figure out what is going on and call me back in 2 hours. 2 hours came and went. I angrily went home. \r\n\r\nNow, it is day 3 (still with no e-mails) and the domain name is still \"provisioning.\" I called Comcast and asked to speak to a different manager because Jason lied to me and never called me back (and the host said he never called them either). Now, I deal with the manager whose name is Dustin. He said that Jason had \"escalated\" the ticket to their Tier 2 techs yesterday and it will be 48 hours until I will get a response. I got upset because this issue has already been going on 48 hours and it would appear on my end that they have done nothing. I finally got Dustin to talk to our host (had to make a conference call) and Dustin said he would have his Tier 3 tech call them and figure out what is going on. He said I should receive a response in about 2 hours. \r\n\r\nI waited 2 and got a call from the Tier 3 tech, Kris (after 48 hours, you would think it would already be at Tier 3). He said it had something to do with Century Link not releasing the domain. He said he would work on it and give me a call back. I then called Century Link and asked if Comcast had called in regards to our account. They informed me that they had no record of receiving a call from Comcast regarding our domain name. Finally, Kris called me at about 3:30 and informed me that the problem was on their end and he didn't know why they would not propagate the domain name. He said he would have to send a message to the manager (I am assuming Dustin) to tell the other techs to \"get their ** in gear, \" basically saying it was Comcast's issue the whole time. \r\n\r\nSo, to sum it all up, 3 days with no e-mail (we figured we lost about $1000 a day at least in orders), my staff who cannot do their job for three days (their job is e-mailing customers and receiving orders via e-mail) thus about another $500 in pay lost, and I made at least 20 phone calls to our host, Century Link and Comcast. When I spoke to Dustin regarding compensation due to the fact that Comcast did not do their job and also told us that the transition would be \"seamless,\" he said simply, \"we don't do that.\" \r\n\r\nI am very unhappy with how the situation was handled by Comcast, how the sales associate lied to us and how the only thing anybody did was finger point on whose problem it was. Also, now I have to work overtime on the weekend to get our e-mail back on track (that is assuming they have fixed it by tomorrow morning). If I were to grade my Comcast experience so far, it would be an F for Fail.\r\n", "In February, after 6 months of our \"bundle\" bill going up each month, we called Comcast. The bill had reached $182 a month! My husband took great notes on everything. They offered us $139 a month for the first year and $159 the second year. We asked for a contract but they said they don't do that. Since then, each month, the bill has gone up. This month we reached $152. My husband called them and spoke with a supervisor who said they didn't care about our business and there was nothing he could do. He could not explain the extra charges. My husband asked how they could change the contract and he wouldn't answer the question. My husband then did a computer chat with customer service and felt much better. The man said there was a mistake and we would receive a call within 24-48 hours to correct it. That was four days ago and we have not received a call.", "On April 25th, I was charged for two cable modems and two separate internet services. I contacted customer service on May 5th. The representative told me the problem would fix itself. Two weeks later, the issue wasn't resolved. I contacted customer service again and was told by the representative that he put the credit on my account. I logged on a few days later to discover that it was not applied. I contacted customer service and was told the credit was already applied, so I checked my records against Comcast and found that the credit was not applied. I contacted customer service a fourth time to be told that the credit would be put on the account. I told the rep that I keep getting the same response and it never gets done, so I would like to speak with a supervisor. \r\n\r\nI was placed on hold for 12 minutes. Afterwards, the rep said no supervisor was available. I told her to find one. The counter went to 55 minutes on my cell phone before I got a supervisor (I had to explain to her that if her supervisor was not available, then get the general manager. If they aren't available, then get the operations manager). In total, the call lasted 1 hour 7 minutes and 36 seconds, only to be told by the supervisor that they would put the credit on next month's bill. I am cutting my losses, paying my account down to a 0 balance and getting a different ISP. This was a $130 lesson learned.", "Where to begin. After having slow internet speed with Verizon in my husband and I's first home, we decided to transfer to Comcast. I believe this was the biggest mistake we could have made! We have had Comcast for a little over a month now. For some reason, all of the cable lines running to our home were cut, so Comcast had to fix the problem before we could get internet. In one week, we had scheduled for three different technicians to come to our home. Well, the first appointment was missed so we called that day after the scheduled time. We were told that they had cancelled our appointment and rescheduled it without telling us! So we waited about 3 days later for our second appointment. No one showed. \r\n\r\nWe waited a couple hours past our appointment time and finally, someone showed. However, he was not doing what he was scheduled to do! We called Comcast and told them of our problem, that the technician did not know how the first appointment was missed and so he was working on preparing us for the third appointment instead of the second. They told us that they were at fault for not communicating to that technician. Finally, the third appointment day came and no one showed! We were so frustrated at this point that we called and spoke to the highest person up about what all has happened and demanded for their Comcast Customer Guarantee ($20 for each missed appointment). She said that $60 would be given to us and deducted from our bills. \r\n\r\nBeing a little satisfied after that phone call, we waited about one more week until the last technician could come out and fix everyone's problems. This man was very disappointed with our service so far and therefore did more than what he was supposed to do and admitted that Comcast has horrible communication with their technicians. So for about two or three weeks, we had fantastic wireless internet speed until about a week and a half ago. Our internet speed has been incredibly slow. We have made several (9) phone calls to Comcast and every person reset our modem and told us that they do not know how else to help. \r\n\r\nFinally, we demanded for a technician to come out and check our end of everything. When he came out, he stayed for about an hour and a half checking to make sure that nothing wrong was coming from us. He checked both of our computers, our router and our modem. He even gave us a brand new modem for free just to ensure that nothing was wrong on our end! When he left, he stated that the IT department that Comcast works with created the problem and he sent in a ticket that would be corrected within the next 24 hours. Well, here we are 72 hours later with incredibly slow internet. For about a week and a half, we have had a download speed of between 0.08-0.26 (when we are paying for 24.0) and an upload speed of 4.5 (when we are paying for between 3-4). \r\n\r\nAfter the 24 hours was up, we called Comcast and were forwarded to the IT department, who was supposed to fix the problem they created. From India (where the IT department was based out of), we were told that they needed the right to charge us in order to discover where the problem is. I could have screamed! Both my husband and I had to talk to the IT department, who was very rude and inconsiderate. He said they saw the problem but the fact that we called him was because that we had the problem that they had to fix. We very politely told him that we were told that they created the problem and therefore we should not be charged for them to fix the problem that they created. \r\n\r\nAfter being interrupted many times from this man, we asked him to forward us to the highest possible person with Comcast. We were sent to the automatic voice when you call Comcast at the very beginning without the man saying a word to us before he left. We called one last time and they said that they would send out a technician, to do the same thing that was done 72 hours ago. Oh, and the $60 guaranteed by a higher up at Comcast and the Comcast Customer Guarantee was still never given to us - almost two months later. We cannot deal with this any longer, especially given that our college courses start in only four days! We won't even be able to download our class lectures with this horrible service. It is time to cancel service with Comcast now.", "I have had numerous problems with Comcast. The agents seem to be dumbfounded when I call or go online to request basic information. I have had to deal with inaccurate billing, incorrect information about my account, (i.e., wrong Social Security number, return of equipment, numerous attempts to set up a home phone and the repeated phone calls to verify the e911 portion where I get to speak with agents in India, whose second language is apparently basic English). It seems as though the agents do not seem to have the same knowledge of the services offered. Lastly, please do not get me started on the very poor online chat or customer service access. At one point, I was connected to four different agents who each asked for the same information 4 times. It was maddening, to say the least.\r\n\r\nMonopoly - I thought Microsoft was sued for such activity? What the heck is the difference between them and Comcast Internet Services? DirecTV desperately needs to get internet and phone services.\r\n\r\n", "We pay $69.95/month for 20 Mbps Internet. We average 2-6 Mbps. We get calls all the time where the salesman from Comcast tells us he's going to send someone out with a cable box and sign us up for cable at the low rate of whatever. And we usually have to hang up on them because they don't take no for an answer. Before signing up with Comcast, be aware of what you're getting into and use someone else if you (unlike us) have the option.\r\n", "New bill from Comcast today yet another increase for service, 3 TV's, (2 digital, one digital w/ HD service) and internet at $171.51/month but no premium channels! Are they kidding? Comcast is now more than our NJ car insurance per year, for 2 cars with full coverage. Figure it out. It's over $2,000 per year for cable service! If we watch 4 hours of TV a day, it's a lot. Pricing should be paid per use. Yeah, I'm angry but what can I do? They are the only ISP in the area. What happened with cable deregulation? Was that not supposed to force competition? No, Comcast has the market sewn up. Oh and ask why I need 20 sports channels? We can't customize service yet. \r\n\r\nHa, now that is a downright lie. So, I contacted Comcast and they can only offer a $10 monthly reduction for 1 year. Yes, you heard it folks, a whopping $10 bucks! Well, that just brought the cost down to what it was before the increase. Yippee! I am fed up with being tied up by a self serving ISP. FiOS is not available and Dish isn't much better. If anyone is as angry as I am, I urge you to write to your local government agency among others, as I am. One site is GovSpot.com.", "I ordered Internet from Comcast on 2/11/2013. The equipment came on 2/15/2013. I installed everything; however, the Internet light did not come on. I spent 6 hours with them on the phone over the next 2 days, with their techs troubleshooting from a remote location. As this was clearly not efficient at solving the problem, I kept asking them to send out a tech to look at the problem. They kept telling me stories about how they couldn't find their appointment books (?). Finally, I got through to a supervisor who told me the earliest he could send someone was 2/26/2013. I asked if there would be a charge. He said no, since the issue must be on their end, after that exhaustive round of troubleshooting did not get results.\r\n\r\nOn 2/25, I left work early to be there for the tech who was supposed to come between 3 and 5 pm. No one showed up. I found in my mailbox that they had already mailed me a bill, even though they had not provided me with any service. I called repeatedly; they kept saying the tech was on the way and that once the service was up, they could prorate the account. At 5:30 they apologized, told me my account would get a $20 credit for their failure to live up to the company guarantee because the tech never came. Later that night, they did get someone out, who again told me there would be no charge to me because the issue was behind the wall with wiring, which is something their company is supposed to take care of. He also left a huge hole in the wall, which my landlord will no doubt be charging me for.\r\n\r\nToday, 2/26, I called Comcast to get a prorate on my account. The account representative I spoke with, called Ed, who is in Massachusetts, did a complete bait and switch. He told me I would be charged $50 for the tech, and he would not prorate the account or honor the $20 credit that Marti had given me for the inconvenience of the tech not showing. Then he said he'd waive the tech fee. I kept telling him there should be no tech fee. The tech himself said it was on their end; it was not something a layperson would have known about. He said he could just leave the $50 charge on there then. I realized since he was not honoring the previous associates\u2019 words and he would readily charge me $50 for something that was not my fault, I should just accept the waive of the $50 that I should not have been charged anyway. He remained steadfast in his refusal to prorate the account, and he would not give the $20 credit. It's not even worth it to call back and complain to someone else because honestly, this is how this company operates - so unfair, dishonest, and unethical.\r\n", "I switched internet service from AT&T to Comcast. A big mistake. Now, I cannot watch PBS NewsHour videos. Everything else (Netflix, CBS, NBC) works fine but not PBS. Their customer service rep says (on a chat service) that the problem is with the site. This is an old, completely lame excuse that I discovered Comcast was using two years ago with Netflix service until Netflix agreed to pay them a fee for service. It is one thing to block a commercial site, but to block a public service site is horrible. The executives at Comcast should be tarred and feathered.", "My horrible experience with Comcast started a few weeks ago. My boss and I were working late one evening when we noticed that neither one of us could send emails with attachments from any of our multiple webmail accounts (it is worth mentioning that my boss and I work out of his house). This problem forced us to call it quits. The next morning, I find out that after I left the previous evening, my boss spent several hours on the phone with Comcast and did not get the issue resolved. It is then my turn to call Comcast and after talking with several support advisors for hours, including a manager, I got nowhere. \r\n\r\nAfter wasting my entire morning, I finally spoke with someone who seems to know more/is more intelligent than the previous Comcast employees that I spoke with. I am told that the reason we are having internet problems is related to the fact that Comcast recently upgraded internet speeds in our area. Apparently, the modem we had (which was rented from Comcast) was not allowing us to access the higher speeds and according to the support person was the root of our problems. I was told that we needed a new modem and that Comcast could send one to us in 3-5 days. \r\n\r\nSince my boss and I work out of his house, we couldn't wait that long and I went to Best Buy immediately and bought an appropriate modem. It is worth noting that Comcast never sent out a notice in the mail explaining the internet speed increase and the fact that existing equipment might need to be upgraded in order to gain access to the faster speeds.\r\n\r\nAfter I installed the new modem and registered it with Comcast, the problem continued. I called a friend who works in the IT industry and he told me to run a speed test. After doing this, I learned that the download speed on the internet is fine but the upload speed is very poor and is the reason we are having problems sending emails with attachments. Again I called up Comcast and after a long conversation, I was told to contact a special technical support department in order to get the problem resolved. \r\n\r\nI spoke with a manager in this department who explained to me that the problem is on our end with the new modem and can be fixed, but they were going to charge us 50 some odd dollars to do so. At this point, I was fuming mad and told the manager that this was unacceptable. The conversation went nowhere and hang up. I called the regular Comcast support again, and after more time wasting, it is determined that the best course of action is to have a technician to come to my boss\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nThe technician went 3 days later. At some point in days before the appointment, the download speed issue had somehow been fixed and everything was working fine. I could send emails with large attachments without any problems. The technician looked over all the components and checked the cables, and everything was working great.\r\n\r\nFast forward a week and one morning, the internet goes from connected to unconnected every few minutes and eventually stays unconnected. I call Comcast again and spend my entire morning trying to have someone help me figure out what\u2019s going on. I tell the Comcast person my experience from the previous week and they decide the best course of action is to send out a technician to the house again. The Comcast person I spoke with tells me that they also want to send a different technician to check the cables and components at the street level. However, based on the schedule, the earliest they can send that technician out is in 4 WEEKS!! I find this totally unacceptable and am told that this is the best they can do.\r\n\r\nA day or so later, my boss speaks with a neighbor down the street who has been experiencing the similar problems with their Comcast internet. The house technician shows up two days after this and we are finally told the truth. THE ENTIRE STREET AND NEIGHBORING STREETS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS!! The fact that my boss and I wasted a total of 3 working days trying to figure out what was going on with the internet was very upsetting. The worst part of this experience was Comcast repeatedly telling us that the internet issues we were experiencing were on our end of things. \r\n\r\nThey were not being truthful with the fact that we were one of many in the area that were experiencing the same issues, meaning that the problems were in fact on their end. We still don\u2019t know what the exact reason/cause is for the internet issues because the street level technician won\u2019t show up for another few weeks. As far as we know, issues with the internet could still occur at any time. We are currently looking into other internet providers in hopes that we find one that is reliable.\r\n", "On any given day, I would easily achieve speeds between 16.00/25.00. In the beginning, I rented Comcast's WiFi Router combo, but it was a P.O.S. as well, so I returned it and purchased a separate router & modem (I've read it's a preferred option); speeds seem to be far better than previously. However, as of last week, the same problem started once again. I've been experiencing slow to ridiculously slow internet speeds, mostly in the evenings and between the hours of 4PM - 8PM. Download speeds were between 0.44/1.08 & Upload unaffected, and steady between 4.00/5.00. \r\n\r\nThe worst was last night. I purchased an HD movie from iTunes and usually it would begin 1-2 min. after purchase. This time, I was getting a message on screen advising a time movie would be ready to view, as it was \"loading\" and it jumped from 1 hr. 36 min to as high as 3 hours!. After 45 min., and a reset of modem, movie began to play. I stopped calling Comcast Customer Service. It's pointless since they always assume it's on the customer's end, and they do the usual system checks and ask you to turn off modem and restart. B.S., I tell you. I believe they are doing something to slow the speeds down during these times, but what can the consumer do? My only other option is AT&T, but only DSL is available, and why should I switch? If I'm paying for high speed service with Comcast, I should expect top speeds no matter what time of day it may be. Frustrating, I tell.", "Have had issues off and on for the past year. Most notable being kicked off the internet while working, and having to reconnect, sometimes as often as several times an hour. Have spent countless hours on the phone with tech support and have had at least 4 technicians come to my home, crawling through the attic, climbing poles outside, and even replacing the modem. And yet the problem persists. At one point last Sept I signed up for \"Signature Support\" thinking that because I was paying extra for the service, I would get improved service... NOT! Not only did I spend hours on the phone with them trying to resolve problems, but they said the problem was not with the router but the computer. They would gladly fix it for an additional fee (by the way it was NOT the computer). At that point in October I realized this was a scam and called to cancel the service. I documented the phone call because I truly couldn't make this up - it was so absurd. \r\n\r\nI was on the phone for over 2.5 hours and this is what transpired; the first person I spoke with was in Texas. After explaining the entire situation to her, I was told she was not authorized to remove this service, or charges from my bill. I was then transferred to a gentleman in Manila. Once again explaining the situation, he tried to assure me the service was worth keeping; however I told him I wanted it removed and I wanted an updated bill to document that it actually had been removed. He was not authorized to do so and transferred me to a lady in Manila. Once again I fully explained the situation. After lengthy discussion she said she also could not help me and transferred me to CHICAGO. Once again explaining the situation and asking for an updated bill I was told simply to deduct the fee from my bill. I certainly did not trust this instruction and when I asked again was transferred back to Manila! I gave up!! \r\n\r\nI did deduct the fee from my bill and could write another paragraph about the results but at this point won't waste more time, other than it took 2 more months and at least 3 more phone calls to get the issue resolved. This company used to be the best around. They expanded TOO fast; with WAY too much decentralization of services to be remotely consumer friendly. In their need to compete with other companies (primarily Uverse in our area) they turned into the antithesis of what they once were. Once again a tech came to my house yesterday. I was told that a month after the service (bundled package) was installed in my home last yr the modem code reverted from the \"promotion\" code, which gave me complete services, to a previous code (partial service) which was why I continued to have problems throughout the past year. (4 previous tech visits never figured this out) \r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury I received my bill which had increased by $20 this month. I called Comcast to ask why and was told the first year pricing was a promotion and July marked the beginning of the second yr. When I asked to have the bill adjusted for the service I did not receive I was transferred -- guess where??-- tech support in MANILA. Not only did they not know who the technician was whom had come to my house, but they had no idea what he did other than the report which stated \"wifi in proper working order\". Tech support in Manila has no idea what tech support in Jax is doing. When I told the lady in Manila the problem occurred once again this AM... guess where they sent me?? ---- Signature Support in Manila--- where I was assured that for a fee my problem would be resolved once and for all. Needless to say, and after my previous experience with Signature Support, I completely lost my temper. Won't bore you with the followup. Needless to say... if you are in a community that offers an alternative to Comcast, don't hesitate.", "I upgraded to the Xfinity internet with Comcast and have had nothing but trouble with tech support. The techs are just probable just doing their jobs and are polite, but the problem is they want to transfer you to level 2 if level 1 can't fix the problem. They must be from some foreign country as they are hard to understand and don't listen to what you are saying. They ask for the same information over and over. Then they repeat what they said several times and by the time you tell them the problem, they want to know the same thing over again until you become so frustrated you want to throw the phone at them. Well, by the time you get to level 2, they want to charge for the service level 1 couldn't handle. This is not the first time I have had trouble with them. I switched to Comcast several years ago and it took 6 months to get the billing and problems fixed.", "I moved in my house August 1st. I had a scheduled appointment for service in my home for 1 or 2 days after my move in date. Appointment was for 3pm. My fiancee got home at 3:10pm and the Comcast tech was sitting outside in his truck. So my fiancee walks over and asked him if he was here for my home and he just shook his head, said no and pulled the window up in her face. So she called Comcast and asked if anyone was coming over to put service in the house that day. They said yeah the tech was there but nobody was home and my fiancee told Comcast that there's a Comcast tech outside and he said he wasn't here for the house so she said oh yeah. He put his paperwork through that nobody was home and then said but regardless of what he should've still provided service if he knew that you hit home. \r\n\r\nBut anyways we got scheduled another day that was like 4 day later. A different tech came out and service home. He did whatever it is he had to do. So he was getting ready to hook the TV on with the box after he finished running all the cable wire. He plugged the cable wire into the cable box and got shocked (red flag something is wrong). Anyways he proceeded, he went and got the hdmi cable and plugged it into the cable box. Then as soon as he plugged in the hdmi to my TV my TV caught fire through the hdmi cable I believe and had me sparks. Now my TV does not work and also my DVD player that was plugged into the TV does not work. So he gathers his stuff, calls Comcast and make a report. \r\n\r\n1hr later Maby, his supervisor, came to my house to check up on what happened and went on saying how he apologize for what happened and said that the tech told him sleuthing was wrong with the house. That it was not grounded. And then went on saying how their tech army electricians that they wouldn't have I known if it was grounded or not. So I told him, \"don't you guys give them training on that or you just tell your techs hey listen ummm if you are putting in service in a home and you almost get your face blow off then that means the house has a problem.\" But anyhow he went on saying that we should be getting a call that same day nowhere than the next and since their box is what caused all this to happen then they are going to reimburse us for our stuff. \r\n\r\n2 days went on and we received no call. So we called and they said we should be getting a call in 6 to 7 days. 6-7 days later no call. We called again and they said we should be getting a call in 24 hours. I let 2 more days pass and no call. So 2 days after that I called again and this time they told me that they don't know why they told me that I would get a call in 6 to 7 days because it takes 30 days. So I got mad and requested a manager. Manager was more cool about things and felt bad about everything I went through and said I should get a call in a day or 2 and if I didn't that I should call back and they would send my report to corporate. \r\n\r\nSo 2 days pass and I get no call. So I call back and it got send to corporate. Next day I get a call from Cable Net and they went on saying that they are not responsible for our stuff because the issue was with the house. We tried explaining to him what happened and he said that his tech told him a different story from what we are saying and that what we are saying isn't in the report. So I said no what I'm telling you is the truth because I saw with my eyes what happened and if report says different then obviously it's just going have down what the tech reported which I'm 100% sure was to back himself up. So now we are going on about close to a month with no service or TV and now after all the ** they put us through they're going to finally call us back just to say they are not responsible for our stuff after everyone else we spoke to from Comcast told us they are going to replace our stuff. So he said he was going call somebody and they was going to contact us back. \r\n\r\nSo now I'm just waiting for a call that I'm sure is not going to come. And I thought to myself first of all I called Comcast to put service in my home, not Cable Net which is a private contractor that help do service for Comcast so I don't know why they made them call me. So I don't know who's paying for my damages but Comcast is going have to do something because did they hired Cable Net to put service in my home that's a issue between them but somebody needs to pay for my stuff. So now I'm just here thinking what else can I possibly do to get this take care off. Is legal actions really my only option? All I want is my TV fixed or replaced and my DVD player, and also some service at a discount for all the ** they put me through. Wish somebody could help me out!!!!", "I had been customer of AT&T/-Verse for nearly 8+ years. Not once in my life had I any terrible devastating customer service experience with them like I just had with Comcast. After doing some long hard research, I notice it would be worth changing my Internet service to Comcast. The reasons were simple: I had AT&T 12 Mbps and was paying $39.99. Then notice Comcast 25 Mbps for $29.99 for 6 months for newer customers and then $44.95 after the six months.\r\n\r\nSo the reason was simple, I pay a little less for six months and then 11% more every month after 6 months but will get 52% more speed just for 11% more cost. This was the simple reason I called Comcast last week and got the service. I am a first time customer of Comcast so I asked all the questions I know that matters to my Internet service. The representative explained the same rate plan for first 6 months and next 6 months and then I was told the technician will come over to my home this week (August 26th, 2013) to install the modem and turn the service on. I told the representative that I wish not to use their modem due to paying additional $7/Month a rental fee. So I provided the information of the Modem that I wish to use (Motorola SB5100) and the representative mentioned it works with Comcast and would have no problem with the internet service. So I order the modem and today, August 26, 2013, I had my internet service activated from outside my home by Comcast.\r\n\r\n1st Worst Call Customer Service Experience: Horrible\r\n\r\nAt 5:40ish PM today, I called Comcast to have my modem active WHICH I WAS TOLD BY THE COMCAST REP THAT WILL WORK. The whole worst experience started with Comcast automated phone service system. I had to find my way around just so I could speak with any representative due to the wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes. It took me 20 minutes before I could speak to one representative. Finally after long 20 minutes, I spoke with a live person who then took my information and took another 10 minutes before he said he will be transferring my call to the Internet Department where they will activate my Motorola Modem. He transferred my call and the representative (female) answered my call and just within a minute, my call got disconnected. After a long 30 minutes when I was about to get my modem activated, my call would get disconnected. I thought someone would call back because all the representatives were constantly asking me my phone number but after 5-10 minutes of wait of not receiving any call, I decided to call again.\r\n\r\n2nd Worst Call Customer Service Experience: Insulting and Rude Behavior\r\n\r\nSo this time, I call again trying to find my way out to somewhat eliminate that 1-hour wait and luckily I did by simply going to Account Department. There I explained the whole situation and the representative transferred my call to the Internet Department after another 15 minutes total wait. This time the representative (male) I spoke with in Internet Department did everything he could just to make my entire first time experience with Comcast a worst Nightmare. I explained to him that I obtained the information regarding the Modem that I personally purchased to use with my service after it was clarified to work with Comcast by Comcast Representative. I provided the details written underneath the modem which was the Serial Number and the MAC ID. \r\n\r\nAfter few minutes the representative came back from putting me on hold and said the modem is at the End of Life and will be Broken soon and said I need Docsis 3.0. Now, I did not understand these increments so I asked what that means and he explained that the modem could stop working in the future or one of these days because it will no longer be supported by the Comcast. I explained to him I was given the details by the Comcast Representative last week when I signed up for the service and he NEVER SAID ONCE any of this and neither did he say this is not what I need. So how come after I verified with Comcast and ordered the modem and even canceled my AT&T Service, you guys are telling me today when I will be without Internet by tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThis Internet Department Representative started getting upset at me and said why would I go purchase something else from the market when Comcast will be providing with the Modem and why would I make this decision and coming back to us telling that we had given the wrong information. I felt so insulted and felt if I am Comcast customer then I must become slave and follow what Comcast wants me to do. I asked him that I would like to speak with his immediate manager or supervisor and after a minute or two of putting me on hold, he said he has the supervisor on the line and will be transferring my call. I kept on saying \"Hello? Hello?\" for almost a minute or two after being transferred but I heard no voice and then again like first time, my call was disconnected.\r\n\r\n3rd Worst Call Customer Service Experience: Disaster\r\n\r\nThis time I called back again just to simply have the service canceled completely which I did not even use ONE SECOND. So after nearly one hour of time that was wasted and being humiliated and insulted by Comcast Representative, I chose to speak with someone in the Customer Care Department hoping I would find a manager or supervisor there. After a few minutes, I spoke to a female voice who I explained this whole horrendous experience I went through and explained to her that not once had I ever had such experience with AT&T in 8 years of being their customer. For a second, I thought maybe because I was talking to someone in Customer Care Department, this person would do everything to make my experience better. But all this representative said was sorry for what I felt and asked me what she wants me to do now. She said the modem is at End of Life and when I asked if that modem supported WiFi, she said it does not because this model is 2.0 and WiFi modems are 3.0. \r\n\r\nThe whole experience from talking to account representative to Internet representative to Customer Care manager was simply horrible, terrifying, and insulting as it didn't matter to anyone keeping the customer as their account holder. I told her I simply wanted to cancel the service which I just signed up for. She stated to do that I will be transferred to Cancellation Department but I told her that I do not want to go through the hassle again and requested her if she could be the middle person and directly explain to them the whole issue I was facing before transferring my call. She said she will make all the notes of which she and I talked about and the Cancellation Department will review them first. \r\n\r\nAfter she made the notes, she said she will now be transferring my call. And as my call was transferred, it once again was disconnected. This time I simply had it with Comcast and again chose the option to go through Customer Care Department and ironically the department was closed because it was 7:08 PM and the customer service department is ONLY OPEN from 7 AM - 7 PM. This person knew this but did not bother to inform me or take the initiative to make my experience any better but simply said, \"I am sorry,\" and transferred my call and after 1 hr and 25 minutes, I end up with no help but with one hell of a disaster customer service experience in my life.\r\n\r\nI simply want this service that I just signed up for last week on August 19th, 2013 to be cancelled as I do not wish to be a part of the company which has no respect for its customers at all. Honestly, I don't even think i would get any response from whoever I am sending this to after the experience I went through but if you guys have any dignity, then improve your customer service and teach your management to take charge.", "Yesterday (Tues, Sept 3, 2013), I spent 3 hours (3pm-6pm) trying to get effective service from Comcast regarding their Internet \"service.\" I had to call back several times due to disconnects, rude incompetent service, reps refusal to listen (constantly interrupting), having to jump through the same grueling hoops over and over and over and over, reps transferring me to voicemail hell where I heard incredibly painful hi-volume \"music\" on hold for up to 35 minutes, hang-ups, etc. I went through this same ordeal about a month ago without a solution to my Internet service problem - AGAIN! I put off calling again because I HATE their \"service\" that wastes many hours of my time.\r\n\r\n(In fact, last time, the technician's phone was breaking up so badly) I couldn't understand him. He said, \"Here's my personal number so you can call me back.\" When I called back, I got the same ** entry point as if I had never talked to anyone at all. I've been a Comcast customer, paying thousand$ of dollar$ for over 2 years (phone, TV, Internet). Regarding the Internet, everything was fine until they sent me a new modem, which I installed according to the directions supplied... yes, I can surf the Internet, BUT... \r\n\r\nNow, I can no longer hook up my wireless printer with my laptop and iPad (which worked before). Now, I can neither FTP-update my websites nor my client's websites (which worked before) due to some sort-of \"port problem\" according to analysts at Blue Host. Now, I cannot access my Comcast Internet Admin account. (Can you say, \"Out of business?\") Of course, Comcast's attitude seems to be it's MY fault: The customer is always wrong!", "They sign you up for one thing and they charge you for higher price. You never get the speed they promise. Their customer and internet service sucks!!!!!!!!", "On 9/1/13, I was waiting for a phone call from our daughter who was traveling to see us. Our phone never rang; however it showed a voice mail on the caller ID. She told us that it went directly to voice mail, so I tried calling customer service and the wait time on their automated system said approx. 15 minute wait time, so I hung up because I was having family come over and figured they were having issues. I checked our phone later that night and it rang at our house, so I thought the problem had been solved. \r\n\r\nOn 9/2/13, the same thing happened and this time I contacted Customer Service and was told our phone number had been changed (without our consent) and they may have re-issued our number out. After being on hold for over 50 minutes, they corrected it and told me I would have to call back the next day to get it permanently corrected. So I did, they were supposed to call me back to confirm that it was done; however I never received a call back, but the phone was correct (THAT is until 9/11/13). I was on a phone call and it automatically disconnected our call and I had no dial tone to call out. \r\n\r\nI had to make 3 calls (being disconnected after 15 minutes on hold, talking to another customer service rep and then demanding to speak with his supervisor). Their response was we called in June and they miscoded something which caused this error and they have already re-issued our number out and cannot get it back, but they would try to contact the new customer. I went 5 days without any phone service because someone in their company put the \"new phone number\" they assigned to us on a different port and we had to have a tech come out to the house to find this out. \r\n\r\nI have been on the phone with them (supervisor and IT supervisor) trying to get this resolved. They said they couldn't just go and take the number back; however that is exactly what they did to me!!!!!! I want my old number back since I have had it for over 4 years and it was not my error in the first place... I told the supervisor that I would call the new people every 15 minutes 24 hours a day until they turned it back in if they refuse to give my number back. It isn't their fault, but it is not mine either and I shouldn't have to make changes for an error they did.", "Well I am a happy camper. I got a hold of someone who went above and beyond and resolved the problem with our phone. We got our old number back and was compensated for the inconvenience. I spoke with Mike yesterday and he told me it could take up to a week. However this evening he called us and it was fixed. He took it personal that Comcast made the error and hadn't corrected it. I did contact the FCC and file and complaint along with our local media watchdog, but will let them know it has been resolved. He also told me if we have any more problems to contact him directly immediately.", "Since September 4th, 2013 I have tried and tried to get Comcast to fix my internet and TV service. I have spent countless hours on hold and talking with clerks who have no authority, training or control of the situation. Theirs is a system without accountability or internal controls and the result is a system wildly out of control and completely unresponsive to the customer. Missed appointments (4), no call backs as promised (several), wrong information (countless), hours and hours on hold. I have never been this angry and frustrated with a company. It has been absolutely unbelievable.", "I don't own a TV. Comcast provides me with internet. They've charged me $50 to fix a problem that was their fault. They have sent me adapters, remotes, a new router without me ordering them!! Then in the tiniest writing possible, somewhere under a flap of the box it says, \"If you don't return this product in 5 days, we will begin to start charging you $ for our products\". That's such crap!! I have to take time out of my day to go to the post office or find a UPS store, find parking, wait in line, then drop off a product that I can't even USE and did not order otherwise I will be charged?! This should be illegal! I'm canceling the service.", "When I moved I called to have Comcast installed because like everyone else I saw their ads and thought I would be getting good service. Boy was I ever wrong. When I called I stated I wanted the DVR in one room and standard in four other rooms. Was told okay and they would be out in a few days to do it. The day of installation arrives and the installer hooks up my DVR in the living room and then he hooks up the internet in my master and he's ready to leave. Hold up I say what about my other rooms. His reply was: \"That wasn't on my work order, I have to call it in.\" \r\n\r\nAfter walking around my house he tells me he can't install cable in my bedrooms because the wires were installed wrong and I would have to have wall facing because the wires come in through the attic. I asked could he do it and he said no, Comcast didn't do it anymore. I would have to hire an electrician to install them. I asked, \"Can't you drill a hole in from the outside and do it,\" he said no. I asked since it was installed wrong couldn't we just start over. I just bought the house but I'm assuming Comcast is the one who installed the wires since its their box on the side of the house. He said no because it was already installed I had to have an electrician come out and fix it. I asked him many times could we do it this way or that way and every time was \"No, Comcast doesn't do that.\" \r\n\r\nSo I get on the phone to Comcast. After being hung up on 9 times, I finally get to speak with someone. I explained I want to cancel my service because I can't get cable in my bedrooms. I spoke with Juan and he told me Comcast does do wall facing but there is a charge. I had to pay $60 for the guy to come back out plus $30 for wall facing per room and $35 for something else. It was going to cost around 200 dollars. I said no cancel my service. Juan said, \"Wait, I'm going to get this straightened out because the installer could have installed it differently.\" He said, \"I'm putting this in the computer, call back tomorrow,\" and they would get someone else out here to install it. \r\n\r\nSo I call back today and spoke with the rudest person ever. I'm told they had to install the wall facing because I live in an apartment. What I explained to Juan yesterday that I live in a one story house that I own and yes we could drill a hole in the wall or the floor or anything that needed to be done. After I told her that she hung up on me. So I call back and tell them I want to cancel my service and the lady I spoke with tries to get me to change my mind. I said nope cancel my service. I may have kept trying had the internet worked the way it was supposed to. Only my laptop connects with the internet. My son's Xbox won't connect nor with my tablet. Done with Comcast for good. This was their second chance with me. Canceled years ago because they keep going up on my bill.", "Our power company sent a letter saying that our cable running into the house from Comcast which we now only use for internet was too close to the power line running into the house and was in violation of the electrical codes. I called Comcast and they said they would take care of it. When they never came out, I called back and the ticket was closed. I had it reopened and they said they would take care of it this time. Nothing happened and I called and the ticket had been closed again. This has now happened 3 times and nothing has been done. The internet service is already really slow and the fact that they have such awful customer service makes me glad we are moving soon and there will be more options for internet. I told Comcast that if the power company threatens to turn off our power because of the location of the cable that I would cut it and remove it completely and find internet elsewhere. I still haven't seen any sign that they are going to do anything about this. When I lived in Indianapolis I had no problems with Comcast, but my experience is that they are awful in Illinois.", "This is more a question than complaint but could qualify as the latter. IF most of the sites I use are, more often than not, Slow, what is the point of paying for fast service?", "When I attempt to reply to an email the text block fills with hundreds of garbage characters. They cannot be erased. When I hit the reply icon on their toolbar the entire toolbar becomes inoperable and nothing is sent. Their Customer Service does not comprehend the problem. They read through a script that has nothing to do with the issue. They will not let me talk to a supervisor, nor a resident U.S. citizen, nor an email expert. My email has been inoperable for a month. No one there listens or cares or does anything about the problem.", "Comcast SERVICE is atrocious. They raise prices monthly. I have been a customer for 10 years and I have to wait 3 weeks for service? I broke my pelvis and asked Comcast to deliver an HD box and install it so I can watch TV downstairs since I can't walk upstairs. I am flat on my back. Multiple calls got me nowhere. They cannot come until 3 weeks. What is wrong with them? They suck all this money off their customers and when I ask for 1 service, which I have to pay for they give me an appointment 3 weeks later. All begging and asking resulted in nothing.\r\n\r\nTheir internet services is flawed. They charge for tiny boxes I received 10 years ago monthly 9.95. So I like to get tv downstairs because I am in a wheelchair and can't go upstairs and voila I have to wait 3 weeks. THIS IS UNHEARD OF. They are monopolizing the market and therefore don't care for real customer service. It's totally not fair. They moved it to the 28th of June, 11 days from now. Why can't they offer a simple service to a customer who really is just laying there and unable to go to a store and get the box?\r\n", "6/21, internet stops working. Call Comcast service line. Talk with someone who apologizes for the inconvenience. Determines that the modem (supplied by Comcast) is not working. Says they can send someone on 6/24. I explain that I work on the Internet and that I cannot be out of touch for that long. Person apologizes again and says they will escalate the trouble ticket and I will hear from someone on 6/22 by noon. Noon on 6/22 comes and goes and I hear from no one. \r\n\r\nCall Comcast again. Supervisor apologizes again and says the the escalation was denied but that I will hear from someone at Comcast by 10 am on 6/23. 10 am on 6/23 comes and goes, and another call to Comcast and another supervisor apologizes for the inconvenience. This supervisor \"guarantees\" that someone from Comcast will call and that a service person will come to my house by the end of the day on 6/23, but just to make sure, I have an appointment for a service call between 3 and 5 pm on 6/24. You guess it - no call and no service on 6/23, but service tech does come to my house at 4 pm on 6/24 and \"fixes\" the Internet problem. By this time, I have spent more than 2 and a half hours on the telephone with Comcast. \r\n\r\nFast forward a few days to 6/27, and internet is out again. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience. Supervisor promises service by midday on 6/28, but, no surprise, no one shows. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience and another promise that someone will call between 10 am and noon on 6/29 to arrange to fix the problem. No one calls or fixes anything and another call to Comcast and another apology for the inconvenience. This time, no promise of quick service (I think by now they figure I have caught on that they can make all the promises they want and I can't do anything if the promise is not kept; so why bother), but there will be a service person here between 8 and 10 am on 7/1. I'll believe it when I see it. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty clear that there is a disconnect between the folks who take your call for service and the people who actually fix things and Comcast just as clearly doesn't seem concerned about that disconnect. Oh, and when I called and asked for a credit for the service that I'm paying for and not getting, then Comcast offered to sell me some additional services. Sounds like a good deal!", "I had to smile at the latest public exposure of Comcast's attitude toward customers (The viral bit about the customer trying to cancel his account). Actually, the smile came when I read Comcast's public statement about this latest fiasco. The response was supposedly written by Tom Karinshak, Senior VP - Customer Experience. I've heard numerous people saying they feel sorry for the agent involved in this debacle because he was most likely only doing as told by his superiors. I suspect there is truth in this assumption.\r\n\r\nOur problems with Comcast began over two years ago (TV and Internet). After months of trying to get someone at Comcast to care about our problems, I contacted Corporate. They assigned a senior level employee (their word) to help. This was almost a year ago. Since then, numerous techs have come out to \"fix\" our problems. Each tech finds something s/he says is the cause of all our issues. The \"something\" is fixed and the tech leaves. An hour or two later, the issues reoccur. Comcast keeps sending out senior techs who find new problems and \"fix\" them. At this point, they have replaced just about every part of the system and yet the service issues remain. Meanwhile, getting anyone at the Company to respond to e-mail or telephone calls takes days and even weeks. Keep in mind, by now we are dealing with people at the Corporate level, not the low level field reps.\r\n\r\nWe are very frustrated and fed-up. Every month the bill must be paid, but no one seems to care that we lose channels in mid-program or that our Internet connection is often slower than old-fashioned dial-up. A month ago, we sent another letter to Mr. Karinshak explaining our frustration. We have heard nothing. However, after talking with friends and doing some online research, I now understand why. Mr. Karinshak may be in charge of customer experience, but he never sees any negative feedback. He is so well insulated from customers he has little or no idea how poorly his company is fulfilling the terms of the \"customer guarantee.\"([I'm not sure you can call mere words a guarantee!) If Mr. Karinshak wants to know how his company is performing, I suggest he make himself more accessible. Read the forum posts. Allow customers to e-mail him directly. Spend some time in the field listening to customers. Not all of us are cranks or people bent on dragging a company through the mud and muck. Some of us are simply frustrated and desperate to be heard by someone who will effect meaningful change.", "Our Internet service and phone service have gone out 7 times of the past 15 days between 1:30 and 3PM. I call Comcast and the automated system routes me eventually to a message that we are in an area that is having trouble and they know about the problem. They say they are fixing it. After 5 of these events, I spent over 15 minutes each time trying to get to a person. Once I figured out how to do that, their person told me that they had no record of our phone issues because we didn't talk directly to one of their people.\r\n\r\nThe second time, I asked for a supervisor. The gal put me on hold and 12 minutes later, the phone was cut off and went dead. I called back and asked immediately for a supervisor. The guy put me on hold and the phone went dead after 7 minutes. The last time I called, I left a message in a general mailbox to have a supervisor call me.\r\n\r\nI got a message on my home phone from Gwen, even though I left the message to call my cell phone number (which I left) because I would be at work. I have called Gwen back twice and received no return calls since that time. No messages on my home phone or my cell phone.\r\n", "We have limited cable and internet.  We did not want cable.  We were told it would not save any money because they give a \"discount\" for both.  Their site does not say that.  It says $40 or $49 a month for internet, not $70 a month if you do not have cable TV.  We dropped their service.", "We are a local small company in Rosenberg, TX looking for faster internet service. We signed up with Comcast Business Class internet that promised 22mbps. On July 2011, the service began. Mid July and August, the service would be interrupted and intermittent connection. I called customer service and all they tell the customers is \"they are servicing the area\" with no ETA or no way to resolve. We attempted to cancel the service because of the poor internet service. \r\n\r\nWarning: Comcast locks you in a 3-year contract and if you decide to cancel, they'll charge 75% of the remaining terms. You have to request 4 trouble calls before they \"may\" consider waiving the cancellation fee. The senior tech says there is \"noise\" in the line and does not offer a resolution to fix the issue. They just leave us in the dark about what to do next. Calling is a pain over and over, and holding and holding. As of today, 10/4, service is still unreliable and unpredictable. We're glad we still have our AT&T DSL service that never had an issue. It just maxes out at 6mpbs. Do not order Comcast. They are unreasonable to new customers and will not accommodate or listen to your story. This will be posted on other consumer complaint websites and forums.", "I am a Comcast business class subscriber.  I used the business line for a home office in Miami.  Comcast constantly goes down.  I would say that in the last 3 weeks, the service is unusable.  I had a tech look into this problem.  All I get is excuses.  There is always a problem affecting the area.  Cancellation comes with a hearty price.  When contacting Comcast, it is the same story.  The best one was that their DNS was down.  I found this an odd reason, considering that I run a local DNS which doesn't even use the Comcast DNS.  I suppose the point and click problem solver 2.0 doesn't take this into account, because if their DNS doesn't work, nothing does.  On top of that, they charge 5 dollars for IP address.  I need some help or direction on how to get my problem fixed.  Thanks.", "After a hurricane in August 2011, it knocked all the wires down, and until now, it's not yet repaired. We have reported this 4 times already. We are concerned that the wires on the ground will fail, this winter or earlier. Our business depends on telephone and internet. We are a fully computerized medical practice, in a building with many others; we only depend on Comcast, the only provider available.", "First off, the Comcast service was never right. It was a shoddy install that I had to complete. The cable boxes only worked part time and I spent the other times on customer service trying to get satisfaction. When the time came to pay the bill, I paid through their automated system by credit card. My service was still interrupted for non payment. My bank says Comcast received the money but Comcast says they never did.\r\n\r\nAt this time the matter has still not been resolved. I told Comcast to get this garbage out of my house before it winds up on the curb as garbage! I will go back to DirecTv and a DSL connection for the internet.", "First of all, if I could put a negative instead of one star for this company, I would. Let me tell you a thing or two about Comcast. When I worked there, all product agents and video agents alike were expected to sell, which I think is BS. Next the sales reps are liars and thieves and just want that fat commission check and get all the cool prizes like TVs, Xboxs etc. While in Ap and Video agents, we get balloons nacho day and a !@#$%^& pencil. Please don't ever work for this company and stop using this service from them. That way, they can be reformed and hopefully they will try and turn over a new leaf for their wrong doings when they lose thousands of customers at once.", "I have been using Comcast as my internet provider since April this year. For the last 2 months, I have been getting a slow signal and/or for the third time no internet access at all. I brought this issue with Comcast, but no satisfactory answer. Curiously, this is happening since the day that one for the sales rep. called me to offer \"Blast\" which I declined the offer. I wonder, but one thing's for sure. I am canceling the service and go elsewhere for service.", "<p>When i called Comcast Customer Service to get connected to the internet the first time, they were really good to us and treated us really well. They promised that they have really good and fast internet service and all, but it is not even 10 days and I am facing trouble with internet services. First day when the technician from Comcast came to set up the internet, he showed us the download speed as around more than 30 mbps through speedtest.net. For 3 days, I am facing a problem in even opening web pages and when checking speed, it shows 0.53 mbps.</p>\n", "<p>Internet was not working --reset modem. Home phone was not working and this was a daily issue. I called Comcast last 8/7/2011 and told them the issue. A technician was to come on 8/11/11 between 1:00-4:00, I gave them cell number and asked to be called 1/2 hour before their arrival. I called Comcast at 2:30 and said tech will be there. I called at 4:00; service was some how canceled.  </p>\n<p>Comcast could not tell me who canceled or why. They gave me a new appointment for 8/13/11, 3:00-5:00. Again, I asked them not to call home number since it does not work. Comcast called my cellphone at 3:37 telling me that tech will be there at 4:30. I asked for the tech to call my cell phone 1/2 hour before they come. I got to my house at 4:15, no-show. I called Comcast at 5:17 and was told that the tech was at my house at 3:45 and no one home. I checked my Comcast email and the tech called my home number at 3:45. This phone does not work. Now, I have an appointment on 8/16/11 (3:00-5:00). Comcast has been calling my home number since 8/10/11 even though it does not work. I am looking in to AT&amp;T.</p>\n", "As Comcast was the cable provider servicing the address of the home I purchased, I was forced to attempt to set up service with them. While on the phone with a local rep, she called the previous owners and got an okay from them to terminate service in their name. What ensued was madness.\r\n\r\nI set up installation appointments (multiple), only to have them cancelled by Comcast, because \"service already exists\" at that address. No lie, something like 10 phone calls later, I achieved installation. Despite this, my first bill was sent to the wrong address. When I called to see where my bill was, and to pay it, I was informed of this fact. I then paid my bill in full, over the phone. I checked, as always, to make sure that the payment was actually deducted from my bank account. It was.\r\n\r\nNext month (second month of service), I received a bill stating that my account was past due and my service was being shut off. A call to \"customer service\" (India), was met with a robotic, scripted response that had nothing to do with the questions I was asking. I was informed that my payment had been \"misapplied\". What!? To where, and whom? It was like pulling teeth to get \"India\" to transfer me to a supervisor or billing rep. There I was informed that my payment had been removed from my account and credited to another account. How could this happen, you may ask?\r\n\r\nThe other account holder called up, and giving just the last 4 numbers of the debit card I used to pay, stated that it was his $300 payment. What did Comcast do to verify? They looked to see if anyone had made a $300 payment on the date in question using those last 4 CC numbers. True CIA level security measures! They then suggested I monitor that card for fraud. Not a bad idea. I suggested they ramp up their billing security.", "I was talked into bundling TV, internet, and phone.  The rep never mentioned that long distance and international would have to stay with Comcast and could not use alternate (cheaper) carrier.  2) The internet did not work for 30 days.  Wrong equipment was installed.  I called Comcast and got no help.  Instead, I was told I had to sign up for Infinity Support for $39.99 to find out what the problem was.  I was on the phone up to an hour and transferred all over, and still had no solution.  This company has no customer service.  I cancelled everything and will never do business with them ever again!", "I just moved to the area and ordered cable on November 27, 2011. Here it is three months later and still no cable or internet service to speak of. It has been a living nightmare dealing with Comcast and a complete inconvenience. Starting from day 1 my equipment did not come in a timely manner. After 3-5 days and more than10 phone calls, I finally received my equipment (cable HD box and wireless router); however, I noticed that none of it functioned properly. \r\n\r\nSo once again I had to call Comcast to request another HD box or send a technician to my residence. The first technician never showed up; the second tech didn\u2019t step foot inside my residence; rather, he just went behind my home and said he turned the cable on from there. When I came home that day, I noticed my cable still was not working and neither was my internet! At this point, it was December 14, 2011 and I had become increasingly upset! The third tech was great! He appeared concerned and wanted nothing more than to right the wrong Comcast has committed (that and poor customer service are apparently the only things for which you can provide). \r\n\r\nHe took his time to set everything up: outside working in the back and inside testing out the wire until finally we were on track and my cable and internet worked. Comcast failed yet again as he was never instructed to bring an HD DVR box or a wireless router. He did the best he could, even calling Comcast himself to see what the problem was and order an HD DVR box for me. Again I\u2019d like to point out that tech ** was great! However, he we are. 2 months later, February 1, 2012 and I have not received my HD DVR box or my wireless services.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Homeland Security, by law, is required to tele-work once a week due to traffic regulations in the DC/MD metro-area. However, since Comcast has been insultingly lackadaisical in addressing my issues, I cannot work from home once a week and I don\u2019t have an HD cable box even though you can guarantee my bill shows these services as being provided when they are not! I have been begging and pleading for some sort of assistance since I ordered the service in November 2011. My wife is deployed in Afghanistan and makes every attempt to call when she has time. \r\n\r\nThough we could web chat via Skype, ooVoo, or web-based video links on my wireless devices if I had internet access that\u2019s compatible with Skype or video services, but I don\u2019t. So most nights I fall asleep in living room waiting for her calls. This is affecting our children as they can\u2019t see her to know she\u2019s alright. Though this is a luxury many don\u2019t have, it\u2019s one I willingly pay for and should be receiving just so that I can bring a sense of normalcy to my children.\r\n\r\nThe customer service at Comcast is beyond deplorable! Check my service records and you will see that I have called repeatedly over the past 2 months and with no results which you can speak of. Absolutely nothing! I am disgusted and offended at the way in which this situation has been handled and am more than ready to file a formal complaint! However, before it gets to that point, I would like to offer you the chance to correct this gross negligence. I am simply looking for consistency so my family and I can enjoy our experience here in the National Capitol Region. I am begging for assistance and apologize for the abrasive tone of this communication, but my patience has run out.

We called them. They put us on hold for a good 30 minutes then came back and said it was a mistake and it would be fixed. The next month came and the bill was over $600 again. I called and was told there was nothing they could do, that we had to pay it or we would be cut off. We did not pay it. Now, our landlord pays for the cable (Comcast) and they're doing the same crap to him and we still get bills from Comcast for stuff the landlord pays. \r\n\r\nIt's ** and now my mom has no phone or net and they're telling her that they can't get anyone out there until Friday.

I have called Comcast and have been promised 4 different appointments this week. No one has shown up for any of the scheduled appointments. This is the worst service ever, FCC should decommission them.", "Several months ago, unfortunately, I upgraded my Comcast service agreement to include telephone service. Doing so required a different modem and rather than renting the modem from Comcast, I opted to buy a modem. This modem required a Comcast technician to install and the installation was completed. Shortly thereafter, within 30 days, I began to experience internet problems - getting knocked off and/or not being able to log on. Once again, a technician came to my home, tested the entire system and concluded my purchased modem was at fault. A Comcast modem was installed and I returned the purchased modem for a replacement. When that modem arrived, another Comcast technician was called to install.\r\n\r\nFor a short time, everything functioned properly. Then my phone service stopped working on March 19, 2012. I immediately called and reported the problem and was transferred to tech support, who determined that the modem phone function was not working and needed to be replaced. I shared with the technician that I also had no internet service. I was transferred back to customer care. I was told the earliest appointment available was for March 23 between 3:00 and 5:00. I screamed and yelled to no avail. Since I could not receive or make phone calls using Comcast, I provided customer service my cellular number for purposes of confirming the appointment.\r\n\r\nAt 5:30 on March 23, I again contacted Comcast and was told the service technician called and there being no answer, cancelled the appointment. Of course, the call was made to my home phone number, not the cellular number. Again, Comcast was apologetic but could not provide a technician until March 27 between 11:00 and 1:00. But I was assured that someone would call me in an attempt to expedite service. No call was received, so the next day, I re-contacted Comcast and reminded them that my cellular number, not my home phone number, should be used to confirm the appointment. Now I wait to experience another disappointment. Something must be done. A strong message must be delivered to Comcast.", "Comcast is too big to care about its customers.

Yet, when doing several speed tests for Comcast Xfinity, my download speed ranged from 0.40Mbps to 1.81Mbps download and 0.58Mbps to 0.76Mbps upload. When I called and asked Comcast why it was so slow, the customer service lady said I could pay another $10 a month to upgrade to 12Mbps download and 5Mbps upload. I told her I was not even getting what I was paying for now, so why would I want to pay them more money for something I'm not even getting now?\r\n", "Comcast Xfinity service is abysmal - I switched back to Comcast from Verizon after 3 years when the salesman promised that things are different now after they started with their Xfinity service. There were initial hiccups for sure when I considered opting out as they had the 30-day guarantee, but I stuck with it. It seemed to get a little better over time but then, the problem started with the phone service that most Xfinity triple play customers are now familiar with - you can hear the other party but they cannot hear you a few minutes into the call and you need to redial. \r\n\r\nComcast has not been able to do anything about it. There were disruptions of internet service but except on a few days, it was alright. Yesterday (June 1, 2012), there was a major outage for 3 or 4 hours and when I called Comcast, they said the problem affected our area (Dayton, NJ) and technicians were working on it but could not give an ETA for resolution. The service did come back later but for the last 24+ hours, I've been having interruptions on phone service every few minutes when the line goes dead without a dial tone. The internet cuts off as well, and I have been recycling the modem every few minutes. \r\n\r\nI think Comcast does not have the wherewithal to run a huge data network and their technicians are the least knowledgeable in data networking. I am terribly mad and am thinking of switching out regardless of their termination fee. I rely on internet service for work. God knows how they are able to advertise high speed internet service for businesses when they are unable to deliver a decent service to households. I will never recommend their service - No internet and no phone service from Comcast - to anyone (except their TV).", "Comcast is a joke! I can't get on the internet. I called them and they told me I had to switch to Firefox. I tried it - no better. I told them their lack of software or hardware on their end does not mean I have to be used as an experiment. I dropped AT&T for the same reason. So my next step is writing the FCC, and maybe we can get them on the Nightly News to answer all the complaints. I'm sick and tired of all this!", "I was going to cancel my service and they talked me into staying on with a faster internet service and a new modem. Of course, when I got the new modem, it worked on the landline but the wireless portion did not work. Yes, I know it is cap sensitive and a million charters. When I called in to the little brochure, they slipped in the package it was for signature support services. They wanted to charge me for the support of something they just sent me that did not work. I said that was silly and she said this was the only department that could help with wireless... I hung up with her and called back in, getting cut off two times and spending over 3 hours of my time. I believe the issue is finally fixed now but that remains to be seen. The last service person was great... The three people I spoke with before her were very bad and did not follow through or help me with my problem. I want to switch to Dish or DirecTV now very badly...", "In May of 2012, I had Comcast install a home security system. It never worked as promised. The camera kept dropping off and this system had many false alarms. I had Comcast out to my home over 20 times within the first 90 days after installation. This was extremely frustrating since I had to continue to take time off work to meet the technician. I kept paying monthly for the system and soon got fed up with paying for something that wasn't working. So I cancelled the service in May 2013 and got hit with an $800 cancellation fee.\r\n\r\nAfter talking with many representatives I get the same answer. I finally got to the corporate office and they also refused to waive the fee. This company is as crooked as can be so I cancelled my service and got a new service and I am much happier with my new service. For all you folks out there, don't settle for poor service. Dump them and move on.", "All of my emails on my Comcast.net account(s) have been removed or I no longer have access to. I have placed several service calls. I received one email with directions how to restore my emails from the trash folder. Obviously, they don't really read the service ticket, as this is not the issue. I was informed that I would have my email in my account/resolved in 72 hours... It\u2019s six days later from my last service call. No historical records recovered. Today, they have changed my password. Now I have to wait for a technician to call me back. They provided no further directions, no explanation, no confidence that my communication records are safe, secure and will be returned. I'm so very worried...", "I'm convinced Comcast is throttling my internet signal. We've had issues with connectivity for 4 months now. Nearly every night between 8:30 and 10:30 our speeds slow down to a crawl. During that time it's so bad that we can't even load any websites at all. There have been three tech visits. The first tech said the signal was too strong. He installed a splitter behind the modem. The problem continued. The second tech did absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThe third tech was here for over two hours. He connected his laptop to our modem and using some kind of diagnostic program, he monitored the signal for about an hour and a half. He could clearly see there was an issue with the signal, lots of spikes where there should have been none, but he couldn't fix the issue and would escalate it to the next tier.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later our problems still continued and I hadn't heard one word from Comcast. So, I called again, explained the situation all over again for about the 5th time and they once again set up an appointment for a tech to come out. The day the tech was supposed to come (Oct. 2nd) I received a call from him that afternoon. It was the same tech who had been here for two hours a couple weeks earlier. He said they had received a complaint from another customer who is in our 'node' who has been having the same issues with their internet signal. He also said he had continued to monitor our situation and continued to see the problems with the signal.\r\n\r\nHe asked if it would be okay for another tech to come later in the evening, hopefully during the time frame when we have the problem (8:30-10:30) so that tech could see it for himself. I agreed. Within a half hour after agreeing to the later appointment, the tech who was supposed to come that evening called and said they now had two other customers within our 'node' who are having the same issues. He wasn't going to come to the house after-all. Instead, he and the other tech were going to be monitoring the signal and he asked me to call him if/when the problem occurs so they would be able to pin-point it.\r\n\r\nAt some point that evening the internet stopped working. I called the number given to me by the tech and told him it was happening right at that moment. That was Oct. 2nd and I never heard another word from Comcast. Our problems persisted. Last week I received a letter in the mail asking if I was satisfied with the work completed on October 6th. First of all, I have no knowledge of any work done on October 6th and second of all, our internet continues to be unusable nearly every evening between 8:30 - 10:30... sometimes earlier... sometimes later. I called the phone number that was provided with the letter. The person I reached on the other end had no idea what I was talking about... no record whatsoever of this nightmare we have been going through with this God-awful company! She promised to escalate our problem. Oh gee...thanks.\r\n\r\nTonight I received a call from some other tech who had no idea at all what has been going on these last four months. I'm afraid I lost it when he asked me to describe the problems we've been having. If there were any other internet service providers in my area I would drop Comcast in a second. But unfortunately, they're the only game in town. What on earth does one have to do to get this company to fix my service so that I can actually use what I'm paying my hard-earned money for? I am at my wit's end!", "Comcast Internet service suddenly got slow last month. It was perfectly fine until then, and I had no complaints. Now, even photos can take time to download and I have to wait several minutes to watch certain videos. We called customer care and their resolution is for us to pay more money for faster service, plus $250 to install new equipment to accommodate said faster service. Our current bill of $86 will increase to $114.\r\n", "During the month of December, my BLAST internet service was reduced down to dismal performance metrics e.g., 3 to 9mbps according to your speed test. Initially I thought it was due to the holiday season with lots of internet access from people for holiday activities. Finally the service became unbearable, I called on Jan 8 for service. It took Comcast 4 days to determine that the speed issue was from the outside according to your techs. I called billing dept for a credit and the standard answer I received was \"According to our policy we can only credit you since Jan 8 when you called in.\" It's unacceptable to me since the problem had been there before and the service was not up to par as I paid. If Comcast refused to own up its issue and acts responsibly to its customer like me. I don't need your token credit from Jan 8 to Jan 12. Otherwise, do the right thing, give me the credit for the low standard internet service I received throughout the month of December.", "I have been a customer of Comcast Business Class for about 10 years. Currently I pay $125/month for service with static IP addresses. I have been extremely happy with the service up until about October 2013. The service became very slow from 20Mb/s down to 1Mb/s (upload was 5Mb/s to 0.2Mb/s). I am constantly resetting their cable modem to get a temporary fix. Comcast replaced the modem but the condition still persists. A call today to Comcast resulted in a sales pitch. They suggested that for another $15/month I could get 50Mb/s download and 10Mb/s upload. I just want what I used to get. It appears that they have oversold bandwidth and are rationing services, or they are purposely causing the problem in order to sell customers into higher priced plans.", "In the beginning of this year I decided to leave greedy AT&T DSL and switch to Comcast cable Internet. I don\u2019t subscribe to the land line or TV so Internet is all I need. I switched on Jan 5, attached wireless router to my own cable modem, Comcast tech connected the modem and everything was ok - until Monday Jan 20. After 5pm on that day, my whole family started complaining about outages that would occur 3-4 times an hour and last anywhere from 2 to 10 min. I did quick troubleshooting and realized that cable modem loses the signal then regains it. Naturally, I decide to contact Comcast tech support, without knowing yet that what will happen next will be beyond Good and Evil \u2013 just incredible.\r\n\r\nSo my first contact is made via Comcast chat, in between two outages. At this point chat was broken by yet another outage. So, I immediately drive to the store and fork out $75 for DOCSIS 3 model from Zoom Telephonics. I install it, my computer asked me to run Comcast registration for the new device and everything connects. I live happily for another 30 min. Then, as you guessed already, another outage occurs and 15 min later \u2013 another one.\r\n\r\nI go into chat again and request reimbursement. Agent asks if I have a proof that such reimbursement was indeed promised to me, to which I reply that I saved the entire conversation to PDF file. Agent then files a case and tells me that I will be contacted within 2-3 days (which didn't happen yet but it may happen later). Ok, done with financial matters, now onto the technical issue. This time, I decided to use the phone because outages wouldn't let me finish chats. I am transferred to someone with heavy Indian accent.\r\n\r\nIt is about 11.30 pm, I have no Internet and I understand that I am dealing with lousiest tech support in the world that has no competence, training or just a common sense. I switch us back to the old modem for now. I am about to give up and switch to AT&T first thing in the morning, but my wife, equally enraged, wants to press on. So she dials the support number.\r\n\r\nAt this point I raised my hand to smash the phone into the wall, but instead, I just hang up. Next, I continued troubleshooting and after a couple of modem and router reboots I got us back online albeit with outages. Computer, of course, had nothing to do with it and couldn't have, even in theory. The last conversation also got me wondering if these support guys in India actually wear two hats, one for support and another for sales? In any case, if previous agents were just incompetent, this guy truly deserved the title of King of Morons.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I decided to give it the last try before going back to AT&T and connected to a chat from work (internet at home was unusable) . Surprisingly, this chat agent, after checking my case notes on file and reading my messages, said that she is going to dispatch a technician to my house because it is obvious to her that the modem, or router or computer had nothing to do with the issue I was having. She scheduled the appointment for me. \r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I asked which modem is currently registered with Comcast. She replied \u201cYour Zoom modem is registered as your own and connected to Comcast.\u201d Then I asked her how come that agent from yesterday demanded that I register my modem by the phone call and guys in activation department tried to do it and failed, and then they tried convince me that it is their own modem and if not, I have to go to the local office to resolve the issue? She replied that unfortunately, she has no clue why previous two agents were giving me wrong directions and wrong info.\r\n\r\nSo the tech appt is scheduled for the end of this week and guess what? My internet is up without a glitch for the last 24 hours on my new modem. So, my ordeal is over, hopefully. I can say to the world that of these 6 agents I worked with, only one from billing dept and last one in tech support were good. The rest four can be classified as incompetent and unprofessional idiots, liars, and a mix of type 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nNow tell me: if you were in my shoes, will you ever subscribe to any Comcast service? Would you be willing to talk to all of these who are unable to troubleshoot, but quickly blame customer equipment or provide false information and try to sell you more services instead of fixing broken one? I want to make sure that this story is available to as many people as possible. This may compensate me for wasted time, money and my blood pressure that shot up after communicating with this great Comcast support that is \u201calways here for you, 24-7\u201d.", "I got new Internet only service when I moved a month ago. They gave me a $39.95 \"deal,\" but my bills will be close to $60 a month after all the added charges. No satisfaction at all with queries. Initially, my modem would not work (I was supposed to self-install). I spent two hours on the phone troubleshooting, turning it on and off, etc. They told me that the modem was receiving fine according to their system. Finally got a guy out 4 days later. The wiring out the side of the house was simply waving in the air - not connected to anything. Receiving, my eye.\r\n\r\nThen, the past week, I have sat HOURS waiting for pages to load. Internet speed goes from 0 up to .5 mbps, peaks at 5mbps, and then back to 0. I have unplugged and reset the modem a number of times. No help. I make my living on the computer and am extremely upset that I couldn't get work completed. I cannot find any way to report a problem online. I type \"Report a Problem\" in the search box and it reverts to the default page. The Silver City phone number in the phone directory and online is a disconnected number. Is there no recourse for bad service?", "I replaced my Comcast modem with one I purchased from Best Buy over a year ago. When I installed mine, they had me call in to give them the model number, etc. They also said I had to return the Comcast modem to a service center which I did. About six months later I noticed the rental charge still on my bill so I called in to get it taken off. The guy I spoke with was very nice and said they would investigate and call me back within two to three days. No call back and I forgot about it until now and see they are still charging me for a rental. So called again and now they want me to go back to the service center with the receipt for the modem I purchased over a year ago! They will then \"investigate\" and remove charges. Really... I've been a customer of Comcast since 1998 and have had issues with them before but now they are telling me they don't care anymore. Just the aggravation of having to drive there again, wait in line and prove to them that I bought the modem. I asked the Comcast rep if there was someone I could speak with that could resolve this issue and she said no, I had to go to the center. I think Comcast has lost the idea that customers are number one and they've gotten too big to handle stuff like this. It's very disappointing but DirecTV, here I come.", "I am a snowbird. I called on Monday, March 3, to report that the cable box doesn't respond and that I would like a service technician to come and replace it. I was informed a technician would come between 1-3pm on Tuesday, March 4. At 4pm that day, I called so many times I can't remember, and was told that I was mistaken about the appointment time. It was rescheduled for Wednesday, March 5 between 1-3pm. I decided to drive to the Lake Worth location and replace the box myself. They were very nice at that location. \r\n\r\nI replaced the box myself, called the number provided, 1-855-OK-BEGIN. Went through an automated sequence, but the cable box didn't respond. But, at least the BYPASS light was illuminated (the box I returned was totally dead). I was told it would take 45 minutes (by the automation) for the system to load the information. I was also told that my service call was open and that the expected time of arrival by the technician is between 2:50-3:10PM. Needless to say, as I type this the time is 5:18pm and no call, no service technician, NOTHING. \r\n\r\nWhile I waited, I logged on to Comcast.com to try and get resolution from there... nothing again. I have called about 4x. I have been asked the same questions over and over again with the same results: NOTHING. I requested for a supervisor to call, put on hold and then disconnected. This happened 2x. Right now I got hold of yet another person and was told a supervisor will call me back. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL SERVICE. How can we have this kind of service (or lack thereof) in this country? You would expect it from a 3rd world country? What is the problem???? I am so upset right now. I will report another complaint/update if there is one. I am exhausted right now. This is supposed to be my vacation and I've wasted two days out of my week!", "I have taken internet connection from COMCAST in the month of March 2014. However I would like to say that I had very bad experience with COMCAST company. Attached are the complete details.", "Ordered Comcast on April 28th internet and television. Quote was $116.00 a month for the first year. Comcast mailed a defective box for a $15.00 self install. I called tech support and they sent out a tech guy who simple replaced their defective box. I was told by the Comcast technician, there would be no extra charge for this call. Next, an email arrives saying my monthly bill will be $220.00 per month. I called their billing department, am told the email is wrong and my actual bill is going to be $127.79 per month.\r\n\r\nA month later, an email arrives and tells me I am being billed $320.00. Called their billing department and was told this was for April 28 until the end of June. That is 2 months and 3 days. The $15.00 self install morphed into a $92.00 service call. I asked for a supervisor and was told there was none available but I would receive a call back today. Of course that never happened. My days are numbered at Comcast.", "In March 2014, I got something in the mail that offered my a $200.00 if I switch my cable and internet service to Comcast. In the fine print it stated that I would have to be customer for 90 days. July 02, 2014. I called about the VISA gift card ($200.00), I was told I would not get it. I pay my bill on time each month. When I attempted to call anyone at Comcast each person doesn't have any idea what I'm talking about. I have been hang up on 3 times and have been on the phone with Comcast since 10am and it's now 10:53 am in my area. Please beware of this \"so called DEAL\". I have ask them to disconnected my services. The company (Comcast) has told me I would have to pay a disconnection fee. On top of me not getting the gift card I was promise. I now hate Comcast. The integrity of this Company is shot with me. I just want out and have nothing else to do with Comcast.\r\n", "So many hidden charges in their $119 bundle. My first bill was $370! My salesperson promised 3 different times to correct it. Yea, not so much. Still fighting with them while they keep adding late charges. My internet went out and they came to change box. Guy told me they recycle boxes and can't count on them to be functional. We were out of service 5 days, had to wait for service window (1-4:00) and then they charged me for service call. I am currently waiting for another service call for home security. It's been out for 10 days. So sick of the bs. HATE this company.", "Comcast has been a thorn in my side for years. When I changed service from my previous address but left it connected and transferred to my roommate 6 years ago, it took 4 months to get the $150 over I had paid (because I pay my bills before they are due - well never again with them). I have continuous problems through the years with my internet connection (I pay for top of the line). Then amazingly when I call them and complain suddenly they stop slowing it down. I have reset my router 3 times in the last 24 hours and still was having spotty connection, until suddenly when I logged on here, my Netflix works again. Think I am paranoid - no, I know how these big businesses behave, and they are very capable of tracking all of the data and calls (why do you think the government gets information from them?).", "After many years of happy service with Fios, I was forced into Comcast's clutches when I moved to an area that doesn't support Fios. I spent hours on the phone with 2 people (1) dumb and (1) dumber setting up my plan, and I had to call back and speak to someone to correct their mistakes on the order. Just when I thought I was in the clear, I receive my 1st Bill and find a $150 Deposit Fee on it. I called kicking and screaming but all I got was lip service and apologies for the previous (3) people not telling me. I thought for a short second that maybe they really made a mistake when I found this systemic problem written about all other the web. Rip Off, Stupid, and downright Liars is what I have to look forward to. Fios please come to Leisuretowne Community in Southampton. I need you so badly.", "In March 2009, my husband bought me a new computer.  We decided to put the old one in my step daughter's room.  I went to Comcast's office to get a wireless router.  The first one they gave me was wrong.  After trying for hours to get it up and running, we finally contacted Comcast.  I went back the next day to get the correct one.  We again tried to get it up and running.  My husband accidentally hit the wrong button, which made the old computer (that ran on mice and wheels) the primary computer.  We called Comcast.  What a nightmare!  \r\nAfter sitting on hold for almost an hour, we finally got someone.  We explained what happened.  She was told over and over that the old computer was not wifi.  We were transferred several times.  We could not get it through anyone's head that the computer was not wifi.  this literally went on for about 4 hours with no resolution.  We were then transferred (since it was after hours) to someone in India who barely spoke English.  After another 2 hours, it still wasn\u2019t resolved.  About a week later, a serviceman showed up (3 hours late on a Sunday).  He finally got it up and running.  Mind you, I run an internet business out of my home.  I ended up having to refund my customers almost $1000.00 due to Comcast's inability to take care of their customers.  And to top it off, I was billed for a Sunday call!  We returned the old modem to the office.  We are still being billed $8.95 a month for a modem that was returned.\r\n", "I have had phone and Internet through Comcast since July 2011 (about 4 months).  They sold me on their services when they stated on the phone and their Internet site that you can own your own modem and not pay a monthly service to rent theirs.  I have my own and it was on the list of modems that qualify.  However, this is not the case.  Comcast has billed me a rental fee every month since I have signed up with them.  My husband and I have both tried to resolve this matter, but Comcast refuses to stick with their 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.\r\n\r\nWhen we call, they are unprofessional, leave us on hold for far too long, and when they get back on the phone, it is never the supervisor or the manager that I requested.  It normally takes about three hours to even get a supervisor on the phone, and when they do finally get on the phone, they tell us that they have to open an investigation into the matter.  This has been going on for about three months and I have even taken the modem up to their office so they could verify that it did not belong to them.\r\n\r\nAfter they scanned it into their computer, I gave them some time and called them back (about two weeks) but they did not even have my modem in their system.  Actually, they have no notes in their account in regards to this matter.  I have made several complaints to this company in regards to their service and they do very little to resolve any of the issues.  I still have the line they ran outside hanging on by a shoelace.  I have heard about 10 different times that they need to take care of this and they will make an appointment.\r\n\r\nThey actually sent someone out (2 trucks) who backed up to the pole, looked at the shoe lace real closely, and then left without even speaking to us or looking at us (it is still not fixed).  I am very frustrated and I am getting no help from this company.  I have seen many other people with the same complaints and I honestly want to start a class action lawsuit.  This company needs to be stopped!", "I feel like Comcast should come and hook my services up.  I have been a longtime Comcast costumer.  When I called to get my services transferred, they knew I needed new wiring and they didn't say that I had to pay 50 dollars for an installation fee they set up to appointments. I feel like they should hook up my cable without charging me the 50 dollars.  I am not happy.", "For the past several weeks, I have been experiencing technical issues with Comcast in regards to the internet speed and the emails, which have been failed to be properly delivered in time.  I have been making several different calls back and forth for the last two weeks.  And I had two technicians come out and check out what was wrong with the internet.  They both came out and said that Comcast was having issues with the area and they had been experiencing problems.  Thinking my problem was being addressed to Comcast, I was more than patient. \r\n\r\nTwo days ago, my emails weren't being sent out at all.  I contacted Comcast's customer service and asked to speak to a customer service representative.  Lenard is the name of the individual that attended my call.  Needless to say, he is the most unprofessional person I have ever spoken to.  He would not let me explain to him my problem and would only repeat that Comcast wasn't the one with the issue.  I was on the phone with him for about thirty minutes, until I got fed up with his lack of professionalism.  I asked to speak to a manager or someone of higher ranking.  He did not want to direct my phone call, telling me various times to say please and maybe he'll transfer me.  \r\n\r\nI am not playing games, nor am I acting a fool to be played with.  I have a business to take care of and an office to run.  The only thing I wanted was for someone to resolve my issue, not make matters worse.  He had me on the line for about forty five minutes after he put me on hold and said that he was going to direct me to a manager.  But he never did.  He finally hung up the phone call after having me wait more than an hour and I felt extremely insulted.  I am paying for my service.

I went to their place of business again and changed my cable box. I've since learned that the box has nothing to do with the internet problems. My computer tech has made many visits to my home (my cost) and kept telling me it's Comcast and that they are the worst.</p>\n<p>All reasons were eliminated and Comcast finally, on August 19, sent someone to my home to check the lines. He replaced my cable box (yet again) to the very latest version and replaced my remote. And sure enough, he determined the signal was low and suggested the first thing to try would be replacing/increasing the line from the outside box to my home. He said he would have the outside contractors come. This gentleman gave me his phone number to call him in case things don't go well. He doesn't return my calls now. Why should he, there's nothing he can do.</p>\n<p>I've called this company so many, many times because no one has showed up to fix the service. I've been misled so many times (twice told a supervisor will be calling me to correct the problem but never happened). Today, I asked someone to look at the record for August 19, the date that a Comcast representative came to my home and checked the signals from the lines and supposedly, the date that a work order was done to replace the line outside. I was told that they have no record in their computer that anyone was at my home on that date. I have a signed receipt dated 8/19/11 showing that Comcast was here. I've read so many similar complaints about Comcast and must wonder why isn't a government agency after them for misrepresentations and non-completion of services?</p>\n", "Two weeks ago I had one of my boxes stop working. I called tech support and after verifying my info through the automated service I got a person who barely spoke English to ask me every single question again. Then she asks serial number of box and proceeds to put me on hold for 12 minutes. She then comes back and asks how the other TV that I am splitting the box with is working? I am like what? What are you even talking about? Why would you ask me that? Can you see I have 2 boxes that I pay for? She then tries to tell me that is a normal question. I have been a customer for about 6 years and have never had that asked. And I have had box issues from time to time. I tell her to either answer my question or I want a supervisor. She tells me to hold. After holding 14 more minutes, call is disconnected. Immediately the phone rings and it is an automated survey asking about my call experience. \r\n\r\nI never get a real person but clearly mark the lowest scores and that my problem is not resolved. The system tells me it will call me back in 24 hours or less. I wait 2 weeks, nothing. So today I decide to try on-line help as I do not trust myself to sound civil. The tech never even offers to troubleshoot but says they will send a tech. I have explained what I have been through already, so stupid me thinks they are actually trying to step up. They offer me an appointment next Thursday. I tell her it\u2019s unacceptable and I have had it. This of course is not the first issues with Comcast; they are never ending and never quite fixed. I fire off ** of email while I start to shop around. They actually have a monopoly here in my town. The only other supposed hi-speed internet offered is Century Link at just 1.5 MBPS. 1.5 and no other speeds available. While doing this the phone rings and it\u2019s Comcast. Ever the optimist, I answer thinking my email might have actually gotten to someone who cares about this long standing customer and the way I have been treated and my non-working box. \r\n\r\nI get a snotty woman who threatens to turn off my services unless I pay her right then. Pay her a payment that has already cleared my bank for them at the beginning of the week. Another email, another phone call. This rep swears she knows nothing. She is responding to that automated survey I took 2 weeks ago. Yes, usually we respond in 24 hours but we have been really busy and it is just a coincidence that I called right now after all this mess. She says I need tech again with no troubleshooting measures and she will set that appointment. I sit and wait for it...first available now is next Friday as I turned down the week from Thursday appointment. I shop and search and investigate for 2 hours. I am stuck with them for internet at least unless I want to deal with 1.5 MBPS. No wonder they don't care about this long standing customer. They don't have to. Why, here in Northern Colorado are they a monopoly?\r\n", "Back in August 2011, I was offered a 6-month package by Jessica **** at Comcast. I was already paying $78.08 a month for internet and basic cable. When I spoke to Jessica, she offered me a plan that would include a lot more stations plus Cinemax and HBO plus a faster internet speed. The cost would be only a dollar or so more. Fine, I want it. It will not cost me $99.99 a month. She would be giving me a credit of $20.00 a month for six months which would bring the total amount to $79.99 but I would be getting more TV and faster internet at 12 MB. I am disabled and have been out of work for a very long time. This sounds wonderful, I was so happy. After six months, it would go back to the $99.99 a month. \r\n\r\nWell, I have emailed her several times trying to get the correction fixed because I am still being billed wrongly. She has in response and said that she has emailed her supervisor for the codes but with no response. Since then, I have nothing but billing problems, email and internet connection problems. Every one says they cannot change the price so I have kept emailing Jessica. After three months now, I am being charged for Cinemax until now. They say that they are crediting it and the service calls to fix the internet and still it has not been done. I cannot believe how much time I have had to put into this. Furthermore, they will credit one and not the other when I have called on the same day. This has to be wrong that they can continue to keep my money and say that next month, it will show up as a credit and so on and on. What do I do?", "Below is a copy of an email that I sent to Gregory, sales at Comcast Business, and I am still waiting to hear back from him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello Gregory,\r\n\r\nI have reviewed the attached document, but did not agree to pay the $199 installation fee to have internet installed at our business. During our telephone conversation this morning, I clearly asked you what where all of the charges that we would be responsible for our business internet, and you replied $66.95/month which includes internet and modem fee plus a few dollars for tax. There was no mention of the $199 installation fee, and I am requesting that you waive that fee; otherwise, we will cancel the installation.\r\n\r\nI did some research this morning and found that this it is common business practice for Comcast not mention the installation fee and wait until the customer receives their first bill to discover that they've been defrauded. Shame on Comcast!\u201d\r\n", "Friday, March 16, 2012, I spoke to 4 people regarding the slow speed regarding my internet. I am unable to retrieve my emails, including accessing the internet. I requested to speak to a supervisor. One of the 4 people was supervisor Joe. He put me in touch with technician Robert who scheduled a technician come out to my home Monday, March 16 between the hours of 3 pm and 6 pm. The day before, Sunday, March 18th, I received an automated confirmation phone call. Leaving work early, I arrived home at 1 pm and waited at home for the rest of the day. The technician never phoned nor showed up! My records will show that I am an excellent customer who has been with Comcast for more than 6 years. I live in a condominium building of 295 units. Half of my building has left Comcast and have transferred their service to Verizon. I am appalled by the poor service I received from Comcast.", "I needed to scale down for budgetary purposes and decided I wanted to get rid of my cable service altogether, but keep my high speed Internet, which I use for work-at-home purposes. Comcast threatened that if we canceled our cable, they would raise the price of high speed Internet, so that it would cost more to do high speed Internet only than to do high speed Internet plus cable. These people are savages. This is supposed to be America. We are supposed to be concerned with monopolies and trusts - with collusion and price-fixing and absence of competition - with the bullying of the American consumer. Shame on Comcast and on the American politicians.", "I am a new customer and I only ordered internet Xfinity. I was told of all the charges and then today, I get my first bill and they have added a reconnect fee, which I was never told about. I was told there was no installation fee because I was a new customer. I called and, of course, they dance around what I was told and tell me I have to pay the installation fee. \r\n\r\nThis is so unfair and sad that a company as large as Comcast would play these games to get a customer to sign up and then they screw you over with added fees. What happened to honesty and giving a customer what you promised? The guy that came to install the internet couldn't even help me setup my computer because he does not know the Apple computer. I had to pay someone else to come setup my computer. The installer didn't give me a so called welcome package and didn't do anything but connect from the outside. \r\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s be fair. Should I have to pay for services that the installer had no knowledge of setting up my Apple laptop? Until today, 2 weeks later, I still don't have a Comcast email address.\r\n", "After seeing a promotion for $150 Visa Gift Card with bundled service, I decided to try Comcast. I was to have my service installed mid-October. The day before installation, I received a call from a rep telling me my installation needed to be rescheduled because there was no service contract on file. Without that, I could not receive my promotion. I was connected to a department where answers to their questions were recorded. It was a verbal agreement to a 2-year contract with them. I was told it would take 3 months to receive my gift card. \r\n\r\nWhen March arrived and I had not received my card, I called to inquire about it. I was told someone would get back to me. April came, and I called again. For the second time, I was told someone would get back to me. By the time May 2 came along, I was furious. I called and was told she personally would get back to me, which she did not. I called yet again on the 8th and the man gave me my word he would look further into this and he would personally call me before the day ended. Guess what? It never happened. This morning, I spoke to yet another rep. He put me on hold for a brief period of time and came back to tell me there was no contract on file. I insisted I did indeed have my conversation recorded for a verbal contract. Now he is looking into this, saying that without a contract, I could not qualify for the gift card. He gave me his number and extension and I am to call him in a week if no one gets back to me. \r\n\r\nI am beyond angry at this point. If they don't keep their word and send me my Visa card, they can take their service and shove it where the sun don't shine. I never had a problem with RCN. I should have stayed with them, but I will definitely be returning to them!", "After moving from Richmond, VA, we were sent a prepaid label to return our computer router and wireless adapter. We mailed them in immediately after receiving the label. Luckily, I kept the receipt from UPS because approximately three weeks later, we received a collections notice. The notice told us that Comcast had contacted them in regards to us owing money for the equipment, stating it had never been returned. When I contacted Comcast, they admitted to submitting us to a collection agency without notifying us of any issue. They also looked up our records and found that they showed that we had, indeed, returned the equipment. I received no apologies and was told that it would take a week for the information to be removed from our account and for the collections agency to stop calling us/sending notices. I'm beyond livid at their mistake and lack of human compassion.", "Eight months ago, I was dissatisfied with the internet service I had before. So I went searching for internet through Comcast as I already had my cable TV through them. I spoke with a woman and told her I was looking for a better deal for internet service, and asked what she could do for me. She told me about different plans. One was what is called Econo Internet Service, it sounded very reasonable. The installation would be spread out over 4 months on my bill. Then there after my payment would be $26.99 + $7.00 for the box rental total $33.99 a month. \r\n\r\nThis month our bill came from Comcast and my husband was furious as our total bill with cable was $123.63. My husband has been out of work since January of this year. So we started to go over our cable bill and realized that for the last 3 months the internet was $36.95 and $35.30. So my husband called Comcast to talk about the problem with the price of the internet. Not only was it wrong, but the math for the internet part of billing was wrong. They informed my husband that that internet service we got from them was a promotional, which is an outright lie because I was the one (Linda **) who spoke with the representative for Comcast when I got the internet. And she informed me that she has this particular plan Econo Internet Service and was really pleased with it. At no time during our conversation discussing the price after installation was paid off that this was a promotional fee. And that it would have gone up. If she had, I would have declined to get it and searched elsewhere for a better deal. \r\n\r\nBecause of my husband being unemployed at this time, money is almost non-existent and every penny counts. And one thing we have to have is the internet for him to search for work and keep applying every week for his unemployment benefits. So instead of canceling the internet for the time being, we had to change our cable TV programs to accommodate for the unfair practice in extorting more money from the consumers. Now I understand why Comcast is rated one of the ten worst companies. They deserve the title. But mark my word. As soon as my husband is employed again, I will kiss Comcast internet goodbye. I almost forgot they told my husband that this promotional was for 6 months. I am livid for them lying like that.", "Comcast won't match competitors. I have tried now for several weeks to get a hold of someone at Comcast that would be able to price match my internet with CenturyLink high speed. After being transferred to multiple departments and offices, being disconnected and being given a fax number for a department instead of the real number, I decided I would try one last time to get someone that would take care of me. I have been a Comcast customer for 6 or 7 years now without any complaints. You would think that they would like to keep a loyal customer happy but that is not the case. I tried several months ago to get them to match a price with DirecTV and basically got the same runaround. They then seemed so surprised when I called to cancel their service. I wanted to keep their service but at $40 difference every month, why should I? It makes no sense to me. I am getting ready to step out the door and go to the store to pick up my CenturyLink modem and sign up with their service. I wonder if they think it is worth it to have a customer this disgruntled.\r\n", "I was scheduled to work from home on Wednesday, 8/8/2012. The Comcast internet to my home stopped working (service outage) from 7:22 am to 3:01 pm. I was not able to work from home for 6.5 hours of the 7.5 hours I was scheduled to work. This cost me $286 in lost wages. Comcast gave me a $4 refund for my inconvenience. Our bill is over $200 a month. We are supposedly one of their (Comcast) most valued customers. You would think they could offer free service for one month or something a little better than $4! I am going to research another cable company.", "I have had Comcast internet for one year, only because it has a monopoly in my area. It's the only internet service I can get besides dial up. We are paying extra for high speed that is rarely high speed. I thought I would save money by getting a home phone through Comcast. It was over $70 to install the phone, which took a total of 2 minutes. After 6 months, they raised my phone bill and I was being charged long distance for my mother's house in the same area code. I called to cancel the phone, and now they said my internet price will go up because I cancelled the phone. I had that price before I got the phone but now it's going up because I'm cancelling? This company is horrible and will screw you any way they can. I hope to God another internet provider comes to our area soon! If you can, avoid using Comcast by all means!", "Comcast is the worst internet provider I've ever encountered bar none! All day I have to work on my computer for my business and everyday it's the same **! Slow and freezing up! I have to shut down everything and reboot in order to get anything done! Not to mention that most of the time, I have to start over with what I was doing because it's lost! They should be banned from continuing any internet service until they do what it takes to make sure that customers get what they are paying for and they provide what they promise! \r\n\r\nI intend on doing all I can to see that everybody will be warned of their incompetent service starting by filing complaints with the BBB and the CPA asap! I would suggest anyone going through this to do the same! You deserve and can get them to refund your money back! Just research that! I had to stop 4 times due to freeze ups just to complete this complaint! I'm surprised I got through it this time! Good luck!", "My son mailed Comcast\u2019s equipment to Comcast when he canceled his service. The equipment came to our home because this is his mailing address. I spoke to a customer representative and was told to mail (US Postal mail) to Illinois, and the equipment was refused. This is clearly stamped on the box that Comcast refused to accept the return of the equipment. My son is still receiving harassing phone calls about the equipment and money he owes for unpaid service. Comcast clearly is not allowing my son to cancel his service and return his equipment. Consequently, this is now in collections!", "There were frequent outages of several hours or more by throttle of bandwidth to almost zero. At an average of once every week, it happens in the 4 pm to 7 pm range. Customer service is clueless and/or blames the modem which I own. I have a great deal of knowledge in telecommunications, having worked in it for many years. It's not the modem - it's Comcast. Upload speeds are not affected, only download speeds. This is intentional and it has to be stopped. I pay for 20Mb/sec and they throttle it down to zero. Not 15, not 12, not 6, but zero. I can receive email only and cannot view YouTube videos or even go to normal websites. It is targeted and punitive against me.", "I opened a retail business and chose Comcast for my business bundle three years ago. The business had to be moved two more times during the three-year period. When I spoke with a representative each time, never once did any of them inform me it was a multi-year \"contract.\" Most egregious (the last move a year ago), without my permission, they tacked on an additional three years and just buried it in the boiler plate of the contract. Why would anybody imagine they would do this without some verbal discussion? My serious mistake was that I trusted the company. My business failed as are so many in this terrible economy and when I tried to discontinue service, I was informed I signed the contract and that I am liable for two more years - to the tune of almost $3,000.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to several other business owners, I have learned that Comcast representatives do not verbally warn people of what they are putting in the fine print - knowing most people trust and do not read those multi-page contracts - and that is what they bank on. Entrapment. Comcast is horrendously unethical, sneaky and downright criminal in their behavior and policy. These policies should be verbally relayed to potential customers so that they can make a rational decision. No business can guarantee they will be in business for several years. Had I known what they were doing, I never would have signed up.\r\n", "If you are a business owner, contact your merchant services provider before changing to Comcast. You will need an IP-compatible terminal. Comcast fails to inform merchants that their system is incompatible with most terminals. You may find out when you contact your merchant services provider with terminal connection issues or if you contact Comcast, they may send a technician on out, charge you $150, and then tell you that you need an IP-compatible terminal.", "I\u2019ve experienced loss of connection to internet/telephone service. All customer service is now in the Philippines. For over three weeks, I have spoken to 15 representatives and had one tech appointment. There is simply no one who can correct issues, credit account, take a complaint, resolve the connection issues or even cancel the service. I have been on hold, had representatives try to sell cable TV addition, and many lost call/hang-ups. We pay plenty for these services and yet we can get no assistance when needed. I further resent the recorded review which does not even inquire as to the problems you are having. I guess it is rocket science, and there is no customer service in this company or even retention of the business. I am seeking another company. Don't use Comcast unless you just crave irritation and incompetence! ", "My wife was on the phone with Comcast for well over 6 hours today and yesterday, was transferred from one rep to another, cut off twice and forwarded to a voicemail. Really stellar service, guys! I have had Comcast service for many, many years. I have had the same email for that entire time and have used the same modem and router now for the last 2-3 years without service problems. Now, it seems that when I want to move my service to a new address, no one seems to know how to fix it! I am only on now because of my iPhone and the wifi in my new building (which is painfully slow)! My wife and I operate home-based businesses and rely on the internet. I can suffer without the cable TV for a day or two, but cannot be without the net, for which they have already billed me for. \r\n\r\nWe had an expedited service call with a confirmation number to have a tech come to our house today. After no show, we called again and after an hour on the phone was told that someone called and came by, but we were not there. That is simply not true. Phone records support no call and a service tech must check in with our concierge to enter the building which was not done! Poor service and dishonest too! I posted numerous complaints to their Facebook page since their corporate website is useless and this is what I got from them moments ago: \"Tracy, your FB posts have also been shared with the executives at corporate. You can also send your detailed account to the email address you used yesterday (comcast_cares@comcast.com). Just to let you know, we removed the multiple posts with the phone number listed.\"\r\n\r\nSo you see, they have decided to remove my posts, rather than fix the problem. Really smooth!", "My internet service stopped working on March 27. I called the 800 number and spoke to a rep. The rep did some troubleshooting and found that my modem is no longer working. The rep then told me to go to the local office and have the modem exchanged. I specifically asked the rep to make sure the local office would be able to exchange the modem. She said yes, they carry the modem in the office and would be able to exchange it. When I arrived at the local office, I was told they do not carry the modem and therefore could not exchange it. The local rep said she would put in a ticket for a technician to exchange my modem on March 28 after 3:30PM. I waited for the rep, but no one showed. \r\n\r\nToday, April 1, I called to report the incident and to reschedule a new time for a tech to exchange my modem. The CSR said the only time available is Thursday or Friday this week. I take online classes and this is my only internet service. We have had Comast service for years and think we deserve better service than what we are receiving. I am very disappointed and have been trying to reach a manager. I am getting the runaround from the CSR. I need help now!", "Ever since we moved into the 2-flat we are in, our cable has simply not worked. Anytime we try to access the On Demand, we get the same error message for no reason which tells us to call and/or unplug and reset our box. If we do this, it takes 5-6 days for the TV to fill in. We have \"To Be Announced\" on almost every channel and it will fill in literally one hour ahead of where we presently are every two hours. We will have no movie channels. We can't watch anything because it will just say \"To Be Announced\" if we go to a channel where the TV isn't showing the title. I have called at least 70 times over the years and then I gave up. We were told something must be interfering with the signal from our box/apartment to their satellites-tower-whatever (they are about a mile from us). \r\n\r\nThe tower is less than four blocks. We have had seven technicians out here this year alone. Some are beyond stupid. One guy said he'd been working there two weeks. They stand and scroll through the menu stuff, reset the box (again) and if it works, it will work for a week or two, then the same thing happens all over. Over the last two years, they have replaced the wire coming in from outside, sent us a new box (two years ago) and claimed they found various things outside on the pole/building from little tears in the wires to I don't know what. One guy got curious at me when he had to come back that same day to replace the cable from outside into our wall because after 7 hours it wasn't fixed even though he said that would be the next step, I guess for someone else to do. \r\n\r\nThis week, I called starting Wednesday of last week to report that all the TV guide was out again. We had bad storms so I said maybe that was it, and yes, I had unplugged the cables, let it sit an hour, plugged it all back in and it was not helping. I told the guy not to reset the box as we had one day of TV guide filling in (so we could see three hours ahead of us on the guide) and so of course, he reset the box anyway. (I was talking to Mexico.) I said I did not want to be rude but asked if I can get a number or talk to someone in the US who does the tech stuff as I have done this to death. He said no, they had no way to do that. He said he'd schedule an appointment for me which was today, the 25th, over a week since I called. I said that was unacceptable and he said that's all he had. He connected me to billing. I was on hold for seven minutes then got disconnected. At this point, I'd been on the phone for three hours and had things to do so I gave up for the day.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I called again and (got Mexico) asked for a supervisor. The guy said he couldn't give me one unless I told him what was wrong and he decided I needed one. I told him the same story. He listened and then put me on hold for 9 minutes. The supervisor got on. I had to tell him the whole thing again. He said there was nothing they could do, but he would give me an appointment sooner, on Tuesday the 24th between 1 and 3. I said fine. He said he would have one of the technicians call us the next day. (No one called again, third time promised.) I called billing and was told by the girl that they could not issue any credits until the tech came out and fixed things, then they can refund money.\r\n\r\nSo we went without TV for a week. When the appointment came on Wednesday, no one showed up. I called and was told that they hadn't told us we had one for sure. He had just said he would try to get me one earlier. This is total ** as I had the guy on speakerphone and my husband also heard him make this appointment as we talked about who would take off work to be home for it. They said we had the appointment for Thursday from 3-5. So here it is Thursday and not only did I take off work 1/2 day, again, to be here but at 20 minutes to 5, Prince Telecommunications called me to tell me they were Comcast and they were really sorry but the guy was running terrifically late and would be here between 6 and 6:30 probably. I said fine and hung up on her. What are you supposed to do?\r\n\r\nThis has been one week with no TV, but this same issue has gone on the entire 13 years we have lived here. We have tried just to put up with it but my nephews are staying with us and no one can ever watch TV. Yet, Comcast calls us at least once a week soliciting, trying to get us to change to their internet service even though we were told that if we have these much problems with the cable, we probably wouldn't have much luck with internet either. The last time someone came out to fix this, Comcast called us relentlessly asking us to take various phone surveys. I literally called and told them if they didn't stop, I'd file a harassment claim. I had to block two of their numbers, it was so bad. How they get away with this is beyond me. Why they are allowed to is purely politics. How many decades have people been complaining about Comcast? I am also tired of calling and getting 15 minutes of ads and menu options just to talk to a human being who can do something.", "I pay over $300 a month for the bundle service - cable TV, telephone and internet. I have three televisions on HD cable and pay extra for each of the HD boxes. The biggest problem we have is with the internet service. The service will all of a sudden disconnect from the Internet. When you troubleshoot the problem, it will say check your modem/router connections, which I have done. We have several computers in the house and the disconnect does not happen all at once - it is random on each computer. It would seem to me if there was a router/modem connection problem that they would all go down at the same time. You can be responding to an email and go to send your response - no connection. \r\n\r\nI have tried to contact customer service and have not been connected. I tried to email them two days ago and my entire email system went down and I did not receive emails yesterday. I have not called because I know they will say it is my equipment and we will have to buy new/pay for a service visit. We have been customers of Comcast since they first entered the market here over 25 years ago. We are starting to look at other options. I am tired of being held hostage. If it were just me, I would disconnect everything but I have a sports fanatic and grandchildren who watch on-demand and cartoon network.", "Back in May, Comcast announced, \"We just increased your Internet speed.\" All that was required was that I have a modem with DOCSYS 3.0, so I purchased a new $100 Motorola modem with DOCSYS 3.0 and hooked it up. I called Comcast to activate the connection. Fine and dandy so far. However, according to the Comcast reps, we're supposed to be getting a minimum of 20 Mbps -- something we have NEVER experienced. We've been lucky to get as high as 1.2 Mbps on rare occasions; usually, we settle for 700 kbps. But then, in the middle of June, downloads dropped to a start of 500 kbps, and then, within 2-3 minutes, it dropped to 20 kbps, rarely completing any download.\r\n\r\nWe've run numerous antivirus programs, Malwarebytes malware scrubber, CCleaner clutter cleaner, defragged hard drives, etc. ALL of these indicate that our PCs are squeaky clean. Ergo, the problem MUST be from Comcast's side. When I contacted Tech Support, they checked from their side and stated that we should be getting that minimum of 20 Mbps. Beyond that, a tech would need to be sent, and if the problem was ascertained to be non-Comcast, it would cost $50. OR, I could agree to pay $3.99 per month forever for the Service Protection Plan.\r\n\r\nThis smacks of a Protection racket scam: sell something, drop the performance to generate the trouble call, then sell \"insurance\" to correct the problem, especially when the fine print reads, \"Restrictions apply. Not available in all areas. Speed increase affects Performance Internet customers. Actual speeds vary and are not guaranteed.\"", "I am currently being sued by Comcast without a reason. I am actually in collection but my account is up to date and my balance is at 0. When I moved to my new rental I made the transfer effective March 1 and I moved and did not get my service installed until March 10 and it took the guy 15 minutes to install the service. No one bothered to let me know that my account number was changed and so was my phone number. I found out because my family was calling and getting a disconnect recording. When I tried calling them back from my house number, that is when I found out I had a new number. Hmm, all this time I took it and was glad to get my service. \r\n\r\nI did write a nasty letter to the CEO, who doesn't really care and got a phone call from some woman at his office offering apologies for all my struggles and my bill was going to be reduced due to a misunderstanding of some wall outlets that I was charged for but didn't need and never got. Long story short, I am now being sued by Comcast for an account cancellation that occurred in May 2013 according to the collection agency. However, the account number does not match my old account or my new account number. I have written letter after letter asking for a resolution and no response. Now my credit is being screwed up by something that is not even my fault and no one seems to care that this company is just out of control. Any suggestions?", "I appreciate your experience and has me rethinking going to Comcrap internet only as DSL with its \"7mg\" is just too slow with the addition of more and more wireless devices. Comcrap has our city tied into them as City administrators won't even talk about allowing competition into our area. My past experience with their Customer NO Service has been that they will tell me anything and deliver nothing. We dropped them (TV) years ago and went over the air with streaming Netflix and have been very happy - not missing Comcrap at all. \r\n\r\nMy cost? After purchasing the necessary antenna and misc. stuff, $8.69 month - for Netflix. The over the air signal is MORE clear than Comcrap ever was (and slightly better than Dish was) and it's FREE! I just asked my neighbor, a \"loyal\" Comcrap customer, how often his bill is increased and his reply was \"every month\"??? Yes, they get a \"couple dollar\" increase EVERY MONTH! I talked myself out of going back to Comcrap. If ever there was a company that doesn't deserve our business, it\u2019s Comcast aka COMCRAP.\r\n\r\nWhy did I leave them? Because they mailed me a flyer for a service that seemed too good to be true. I called the customer no service number on the flyer and explained my understanding of the flyer and asked if that was correct. \"YES\" was the answer. Rather than ordering it from them at the time, I was still skeptical so went to a kiosk at a local mall and discussed the service offering and questioned the guy extensively who assured me that my understanding was correct. I signed up with him, he gave me whatever the device was that was required and off I went. When my next bill came, it was significantly higher than what I had understood and what 2 of Comcrap's people assured me was true. I was so pissed that I canceled my service vowing never to go back.", "I switched to Comcast high speed internet and cable TV because my kids wanted to watch some sports on TV. I was pretty happy with Century Link DSL, but since I was getting TV and all the Comcast ads say they are the fastest I bundled internet with cable. There really are no words to express how upset I am with the experience. My 30 day cancellation period ends in a couple days and I am GONE!\r\n\r\nFirst, despite every ad on TV saying service is their top priority, their service is **. Techs are nice, but it's a scam. I've had techs to my house twice and it still isn't right. Then my network printer didn't work and I called in immediately and on about the 3rd call, having waited a total of 2hrs, no kidding, they told me it was my problem and would cost to get it working again. I said, \"it was working immediately before I switched and is not now, so this is your problem.\" Long story short I finally sucked it up and went to Signature Support (i.e. paid support) and they told me it would cost $14.95 to get it working. I said, \"what the hell\" and OK-ed it. \r\n\r\nThen after changing some settings it worked again. I sensed that I'd been set up on something, so asked and the rep said I had signed up for the $14.95 recurring service plan. I had him transfer me over to cancel that immediately and did. Then looked at my bill and not only was I still on the $14.95 plan they had charged me $50 for the call. I was pissed but figured I could get that off the bill by threatening to cancel. Then my son mentioned that he thought the Comcast wireless was slow compared to Century Link. He watches a lot of MLB videos and they were all breaking up. Then I started noticing that streaming videos and movies were not playing as smoothly as before on CL and downloads were just taking longer.\r\n\r\nSo we were getting pretty dissatisfied with the internet (and the cable was causing us a huge number of frustrations and pissing us off daily, i.e. the new X1 box was going from color to black and white every 2 minutes, requiring box reboot, horrible search menus, just a ** system). After my 7th call to customer service, with about 5 hrs on hold and being pissed off once again I decided to go back to Century Link. So back up and running on CL DSL and Comcast internet still running. I had bookmarked an internet speed test link I saw on the Comcast site and ran a comparison while both are still connected. The Comcast test said I was getting 28 mbps +/- and when I ran it on CL it averaged around 12 mbps. I think that is the biggest scam of them all. But, we all noticed that the CL DSL seemed incredibly fast compared to Comcast. I mean lightning fast. Click, load, it's there. Clean, smooth video playback. It was a palpable improvement over Comcast.\r\n\r\nBut here was this Comcast sourced speed test telling me it was half the speed. I think this speed test, in fact all their talk about the fastest internet, is just one big BS scam, just like everything I've experienced with the company so far. Every time I turn on the TV I see a couple ads an hour BSing about their service and \"fastest internet, no one can match...\" Crap! Customer service their top priority? BS. Fastest high speed internet? BS! I would seriously distrust anything you hear from the company. I will never go back.", "They would not credit one day of 3 years of bad service. They told me to use my internet that I had to buy a splitter and router. Unhook my tv then hook up my internet, with a broken spine and nerve damage. If that is not worth a credit of some type I do not know what is. I have tried to talk with corporate in Philadelphia but you can not get anywhere. Forget Florida Corporate they are even worst. Join our voice, in numbers we have power. I have the FCC applications which they have 30-days to answer. LET'S SEND THEM ALL IN AT ONE TIME TOGETHER. SAME PARCEL, SEND TO PATRICIA ** **. I HAVE A COMCAST PHONE. IT DOES NOT WORK.", "I have internet browsing issues now for over 2 weeks and when they scheduled a tech to come to my home he never showed up. This makes the second no show. Good customer service, right? This company sucks.", "I moved into apartment and called Comcast for setting up internet. They told me the old tenant didn't disconnect the account and I had to wait. It's totally not my fault and why I have to wait for such a long time. Before that, whenever I called the local service, the reply were always voice mail box. And I sent about ten emails but only got one reply.\r\n", "I sold my business and want to cancel Comcast. They still charge me for the cancellation fee, and their reason is \"we still provide service to you\"?!? I talked to the rep and he asked why I don't transfer our service to the new owner. I HATE Comcast so, so, so, so, so much. In another business, I have service with Comcast also. Their internet has been failure almost every month. TV service doesn't work. Phone line is bad. I will cancel contract with Comcast by the end of this year and never recommend any friends of mine to Comcast again.", "The most hated company in the country, and nothing is being done to change their abuse of customers. Worst customer service ever. When I called today, to make a payment through the automated system, it processed a payment for the full balance, instead of the past due amount, because it misunderstood my \"NO\" for a \"YES\". The automated system did not verify the amount I was committing to pay, and processed the full payment. I talked to a rep & a supervisor in the financial department within 2 minutes, and because it was done through the automated system, their hands were tied. They offered to credit back the current charges, within 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen you call customer service, with each representative, you have to verify more information about yourself, than I do when I call a bank. But, the automated system doesn't even confirm the amount you're paying before it is processed, and to process a payment with a customer service person, charges a fee. I am beyond angry. Last year, I canceled all cable television. I don't want to spend money to watch repetitive tv, and reality tv while being smothered in commercials during the programming and even within the television shows themselves. I also don't want to spend my valuable downtime getting wrapped up in a new series that gets canceled after one or two seasons (this generally happens with the shows I like the most). So, I use Netflix and Amazon Prime, and I don't watch new series until they have 3 seasons available. Because of this choice, I need high speed internet. The only choice of company for quality high speed internet is Comcast.\r\n\r\nAfter talking with them today, I immediately began looking at other internet providers and reviews from their customers. Unfortunately, I'm still stuck with Comcast, and at this point, I am so frustrated with paying a company that abuses its customers that I am seriously considering canceling internet service, and just reading books, going to movies, and using my cellphone limitedly to access the internet for news and information. My local libraries never leave me feeling this angry, and I don't pay them for using their books, videos, or internet.\r\n", "Internet went out on Monday August 18th. I immediately called Comcast and was promised by the rep that someone would be out the following day to repair it. Today is Thursday, August 21st and yes you guessed it... still no internet. I have called Comcast 7 times. I was told yesterday to go to my local Comcast office to get a new modem. They said the one I had wasn't working properly. I did all that and yes, you guessed it, still no internet. I told them several times that I work from my computer. It really doesn't matter what you tell them. They\u2019re so backed up w/ service calls that people are waiting 2 to 3 weeks. Absolutely unacceptable!", "I moved in to a new apartment in January of this year. Part of the move-in package was a flyer for comcast service, advertising special pricing on their plans for the whole complex. I called in and spoke to a guy who was pretty rude to begin with, and he explained that there was a $30, $40, and $50 options (typical good better best). I chose the $40 plan and he told me the soonest they could come out was a week and half away... Okay... I scheduled the install for as early as they go, 8 am. I had to leave for work by 11. The installer brought a \"trainee\" and had him setup the system instead. Not a big deal, except the guy clearly didn't know what he was doing and they kept running into \"problems with the wiring\" of my apartment. Whatever. It took them 3 hours and 3 separate modems to find one that was compatible with my apartment. Funny, I thought they worked with the whole complex? \r\n\r\nMy first bill was $130. This apparently was including a $15 per hour rate for each installer. NOT OKAY. Second bill, $50. What?? I went along paying it, happy to just have the internet, until July when my bills went up to $75. I could NOT afford that. At that point, my roommate had bailed on our lease and I was paying everything by myself anyways. I opened a chat with a rep and they told me I was on a \"promotional period\" that was only for 6 months. I read over all my paperwork from my install and my bills and nowhere, freaking nowhere, did it ever say promotional or mention what my bills would be afterwards. \r\n\r\nI still had two months on my lease so I couldn't cancel, but I was pissed. I called in finally this week to cancel (they advertise 24/7 service but not for their cancellation dept) and spoke to a rep. Nicest person I talked to in the whole experience, and also an idiot. He repeated questions, took twenty minutes for the whole process, and kept asking me about my personal life and why I was moving. He also told me that I was going to be billed for the month I moved out anyways?? Comcast is billing me $75 for the month of September after I called and said my last day will be August 31st. He said they will send me a check with the amount left after what service I used. I'M NOT USING IT THE WHOLE MONTH??? What the hell!! Greedy jerks is all I can say.\r\n", "In June 2014 I contacted Comcast regarding new service. The salesperson said I would get a $450 Visa gift card after 3 months of continuous service if we signed up for XFinity Triple Play. We said to go ahead, service was installed July 2014. After NOT receiving any confirmation nor paperwork regarding the gift card, I called Comcast to verify. After numerous run-arounds I was told that I would get the gift card by the end of Nov. 2014. After our 3 months of continuous service, I called again & got the run-around again. Nobody seemed to know anything about a $450 gift card! Now I am told by their sales dept. that I never completed the contract because they never finished it & that's why there's no record of the promotion on my acct. Now they are saying I can't get the gift card because of that! They dropped the ball & I lose out! This is the worst provider! I don't see how they can stay in business!", "I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMPANY. Seriously they should stop serving people. They overcharged, they change your services, offer you a nice package for an affordable price, the surprise: it doubled up for x and y reason. Customer service is not polite, signal is bad, WI-FI is slow, the channel line-up sucks!!! After 4 months of being over-billed and had a TERRIBLE SERVICE I got to disconnected from COMCAST (I had to bring the router to their store, it was back in July). I aged in those four months believe me.\r\n\r\nOn September I received a new bill from these **, they continue charging me with no reason. Because they bill you one month in advance so there is no way to own them money. When I got disconnected I had actually balance in my favor. But if Comcast could take your eyes, it would!! Called several times to solve it. It was supposed to be solved, but guess what I am in collection center now. REALLY? Now I can't get anyone to help me because they say I need to solve with them, that comcast has nothing to do with it. COMCAST is the worst BS!!!", "Internet...After more than a year of internet service with Comcast on which I never exceeded the 300GB data usage cap, I was recently notified that I had reached 90% just 14 days into the month of September. This means that somehow my data usage more than doubled. I have not changed any of my internet habits and just me and my wife live in the house. My problem is two-fold: Comcast added the caps January 2014, months after I started the service but did not notify me of the data caps had been added. We have not changed how we use our internet, yet suddenly we are being notified 1/2 way through the month that we are at the cap...they have something wrong in their algorithm somewhere. I HATE COMCAST.", "From day 1 they installed, it has never work RIGHT. I have call your damn customers service and no one seems to know what the hell is wrong .... mMy calls get put on hold for hours and then dropped - no call back. Now I got bill for service that I never enjoy. 1 thing for sure is cable works just fine but Internet HELL NOOOOOO.  I want this crap out of here but now they want me to pay bill first...how nice.", "I have had to deal with Comcast so many times since 2009 and I've regretted it every single time. If it wasn't bad enough they're pretty much an anti-trust monopoly -- which means I have few alternatives to them -- the service they do provide manages to be wretched, sub-par and abysmal. The service claims to offer up to 75 mbps of broadband speed, yet I rarely ever hit that. My experience with them has been one filled with dropped connections, throttled speeds, and mediocre customer service.\r\n\r\nEvery time I try to talk to their customer service reps, my problems rarely get addressed. All I get is palliative reassurances that 'everything is fine' when they test my internet connections (which coincidentally, occurs during the few moments when my connection is stable) and then something about testing my router, only to be told the problem is on my end and not their part. Then after all of that is over, my internet will go back to sucking again.\r\n\r\nAlso, for some reason, despite how Comcast rakes in billions of dollars every single fiscal year, they can't seem to make their online, automatic payment system work. As a result, my card doesn't get charged on time and on several different occasions, I've had to pay an exorbitantly large late fee as a punishment for the fact that their servers can't process online payments like other companies do. Long story short: Comcast gets a -1000 out of ten from me. I long for the day when actual competition comes along and either Verizon or Google Fiber comes to this area and I will never have to put up with this scrupulous, amoral company with no ethics or concern for others, ever again.\r\n", "Worst customer service EVER. I spent four hours on the phone with six people on two continents over the course of three days, trying to fix an internet problem that it turned out THEY caused. I then spent another hour with three more people trying to get the $110 worth of fees they'd landed me with (for the problem they caused) removed from my bill. \r\n\r\nThe reps, or laughably named \"account executives,\" are worse than useless. The first two I spoke with had no suggestions at all besides \"unplug it and then plug it back in\". With the first, I could hear other people coaching him from the background. The third flat-out lied to me to get me off the phone. I didn't get the same answers from any two reps, and as it turned out, none of the answers they gave me were right anyway. \r\n\r\nIf Comcast is allowed to merge with Time-Warner, it will be a kick in the face to every customer in the country. As far as I can tell, the only reason most people are signed on with Comcast is because there is no other option. It's certainly the case with me - I'd leave in a heartbeat if there was any other service provider in my area.", "Comcast provides my business internet and tv through Xfinity. On the website they gave me to log in, under my account it shows my services and one of their services is online streaming and online tv. I have had this for 9 months and it worked fine. According to person on phone they migrated away and no longer provide this service to business customers. However, no reduction fee. When you sign it says the service is provided. When you call unless you press they say it was never part of service for business, and want to ignore the fact their online says it is. FTC should look into this false advertising by a company that nearly has a monopoly.", "I was living at an apartment in Ft Myers FL. It was infested with bed bugs so I went to court and broke my lease. I had Comcast hook up cable, alarm, internet triple play but with security instead of phone. I moved in February and moved out end of April and I didn't pay last months cable bill which ran about 140$ after tax. I moved in with my father in-law and he got sick with a brain tumor. I returned all the equipment about a month after moving out. My father in-law died and me and my fiance moved to Port Charlotte FL about 30 mins away. I ordered with Comcast to install the same thing I had at Ft Myers address. In the meantime, I found out that Comcast was billing me 640$ for the account in Ft Myers. \r\n\r\nThey come and install the new equipment at the new address and everything is great and I pay until my bill as soon as I get it and things have been good. So I go check the mail on October 31st 2014 and there is a bill in there from Comcast for 1796.00$ so I call and was on the phone with 5 different people explaining what happened. And they all say they charged me a cancellation fee of 1100$ and say to hold on, they need to transfer me or get their supervisor and then I get disconnected!!!! Can someone help me out please! This is crazy and I've been dealing with this since I moved in this address trying to come to an agreement. I figure I owe them about 200$ for the last month bill I didn't pay plus a little late fee.

For over 8 months almost a year I have been experiencing intermittent Internet service from Comcast. \r\n\r\nWhen I phone to report the outage I would have to wait for 20 minutes just to speak to the 1st rep, who would transfer me around several time.

Long story short I was forced to terminate the service out of aggravation and hopelessness after they shut my service off for $40, while I had poor service at full price.

They just want to send a tech so they can charge me extra money. A tech came out in the past & said they didn't give me the right cords & the internet modem was jumping, so he had to get new cords & a different modem out of his van. But they still charged me on my bill; even though they say if it's their service that's not working, you don't have to pay. I shouldn't even have to pay my bill since my service isn't working. At one time, I had internet & cable, but when I cut off the cable I received a higher bill, just for the internet.

The first man we spoke within Tom K's office supposedly took care of everything and credited our account. Guess what, he didn't. I think this company should be banned. They have the rudest customer service reps I have ever dealt with. They hang up on you when you want a supervisor.

I spoke with a nice car from the Philippines who told me Comcast had been overcharging me by $45 to $47 each month since March. She put thru a credit which she said would be between $250 and $300 that would appear by Friday. She also made an appointment for a tech to come look at my Internet whose performance had been terrible for months. She said she'd note the account to show the credit will be applied to my back payment so. That my service would not be turned off. I came home the following night to find my service disconnected - I called d's to see what happened & was told they had no record of a request for a credit on my account & they would not turn my service back on unless I paid my bill first. I late ranked them on a subsequent call to review the 1st call I made & reap for themselves what I was promised - the rep said she'd ask a manager to do this but when the tech came out no credit was on my account & no manager had contacted me saying they had listened to my 1st call. The tech said he couldn't do any work unless I paid my bill first. By this time I was so disgusted with having to deal with this thieving lying company that I told the tech to take everything Comcast out of my house. They have lost a customer that had been with them for over 20 years. This company no longer deserves my business.", "I order a 25 internet speed and I did a speed test and it only gives me 6.28.

I cannot get my gateway to reset so that the home network works. Now all I have is much slower internet connection and not the speed I am paying for.", "I have been with Comcast for almost 2 years. Had to get them because they are the only providers of wifi services in the neighborhood I moved into. So I bundled my phone/internet/cable. I am not a heavy user so imagine my surprise when I get a notification that I have used over 300GB for the past 2 months! In fact I was already over 300 just 16 days into the month!!! Their response was perhaps someone hacked my wifi. REALLY! That's your explanation? Felt better that I wasn't crazy when I see it has happened to others. So I called today to cancel my services. Was disconnected 3 different times! So now what? I now have to get a mifi device so I can have internet access in my home. Also I called xfinity back to see what my bill would be if I just kept the wifi and was told it would be 100.00!! How can that be when most plans average about 25.00 a month! How can they charge so much!!!! Something needs to be done about this.", "I have had intermittent issues connecting to the email server since Thursday night. Two very long phone calls have revealed that it is a nationwide problem that they still can't figure out. I am unable to do important work without email.", "I have had Comcast for only 1 month and in these 4 weeks I have made 3 trips to the service center, multiple visits by technicians and still no results. This is by far the worst ISP provider I have ever dealt with. Both my husband and I work from home and we need certain speeds and we are only getting 2x download speeds... It's ridiculous!! They say they fixed the problem but they haven't. You call their customer service number and all they do is transfer you around and you have to tell your story over every time.... Well, we only had them 4 weeks and today I am switching to AT&T. Someone should really do an investigation on this company and their processes and procedures... THEY NEED A CLUE ON HOW TO TREAT A CUSTOMER AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESS....", "April of 2014, Comcast picked up their modem and gave me a receipt showing that. Each month there is a charge for modem rental. Each month I called to get it taken off. Sometimes they would credit it back and try to take it off the bill. Alas, this has been going on every month since. Finally got to talk to a manager and he told me that we will be credited back when they find the modem they picked up. If they don't locate it then we get charged for the whole modem. I asked him if he understood what he just said to mean. \"How is that fair?\" I asked and he said there is nothing that can be done and I would just have to wait. To make matters worse, they billed us a $70 Trouble Charge. Who can I get to help me make a corporation listen to reason and do what's right?", "Some friends of mine who are and older couple just moved and decided to order new Comcast service. They asked me to be there the day of the Comcast install because I work in the computer/internet business myself and they wanted me to make sure the computers were connected and working properly on the internet and that their TV service was working properly. They figured a \"second set of eyes\" would also be helpful to assure that the Comcast technician did things correctly, because I told them a few horror stories about awful Comcast installs I had witnessed in the recent past.\r\n\r\nThe technician was scheduled to arrive between 1 and 3 PM. I arrived around 1:30 PM that day (Nov 7th, 2014). We waited and waited...no Comcast guy by 3PM. We called, they said dispatch said he would be about 30 minutes late...3:30 then 4:00 then 4:30 PM..still no show. We called again, took the customer service guy 20 minutes to try and reach dispatch and the technician. Finally he told us that they could reach the original technician scheduled on the job, but that they transferred it to another technician who was on his way and he would be there before 7:00 PM (on a Friday evening). We said okay,..and...and..wait, wait....wait...wait...NO SHOW. Comcast sucks. Period.\r\n\r\n", "No doubt the WORST TV/INTERNET/PHONE service EVER. Do not subscribe with them. They charge more than they tell you, don't show up for appointments, customer service hangs up on you. When I first signed on with them, I had 2 land lines to work from home. For 5 months my fax line would not work: 3 service calls, new fax machine and still nothing. When we finally found out Comcast didn't port the number from AT&T. They offered nothing,and was charged $350 install fee! They have zero customer service and don't care about customers. Even service men tell us it's awful. DO NOT USE Comcast. You'll be sorry. I promise you.", "There really isn't much of a choice for high speed internet only Xfinity/Comcast. They claim they are supplying 100mbps internet, of which when we use their choice for internet speed test but internetfrog and testmy.net show otherwise. testmy.net is unable to run an upload test. They always want to send a tech out that really never finds a problem. ", "Business customer wait time to talk to human 30 min. Then no help - piss poor service.", "I have reported this problem to Comcast via email and with their customer service. Regardless of the fact that I have checked the little box that is supposed to \"keep me signed in\" to my internet account for 30 days at a time, I am still forced to sign on average 4 times per day just to get my email. Customer Service stated they would send a Tech out to my home. I made the appointment. When I received the confirmation email for the appointment, it made it very CLEAR that I would be billed for this service! I cancelled the appointment immediately. I cannot believe I pay for internet/email service that DOES NOT PERFORM to this company's specifications. \r\n\r\nSetting up these bogus tech appointments is just another way to reach into the customer's pocket! Funny that this problem started to happen at exactly the same time that I had called Comcast about their monthly bill notification email. Every month, I would receive an email that stated \"Your Bill is Ready\". This email would be sent to me 7-8 days after I had just paid my previous bill! WTF? Totally annoying! So I called Comcast and told them to STOP sending these email notifications. It was right at that time I found myself having to constantly login to get my email. BTW, I will NOT set up auto pay with this Crap Xfinity/Comcast Company because I don't trust them one iota, i.e., I DO NOT want them to have free reign with my bank account. I need to get set up with a new ISP ASAP!", "I have had Comcast for over 5 years now, it would seem ever since I have retired. My wife and I moved from upper New york state and we received terrible internet service where we lived! Always shotty, you would have to cross your fingers and say a little prayer to Mary in hopes that it might work! When we moved down here the folks in our retirement community told us about bundling our package for phone, television, and internet so we did. Now I have no use for the darn phone because I have had my cell phone now for some time and it served me well, but for some reason Verizon just doesn't do too well where I'm at! I don't have any coverage! That's why we got the phone.... Well if I tell you that the service I was provided was anything less than amazing I would be just lying through my teeth!\r\n\r\nNow sure over the years we've had a couple problems especially after hurricane Charlie and a couple nasty storms causing outages and downed power lines, but it was all fixed shortly there after! One time I called up the customer service just as angry as a gang of honey bees, ready to just quit them, because we were out of all three services for 1 week! They immediately apologized and explained that there were some downed lines which there happened to be, I went and looked myself, and they gave me a 25% discount on my bill for that month! I didn't ask for it, they just offered it to me and it wasn't just a day after my call that, it was back on!\r\n\r\nI see all these angry responses to Comcast and I might not know everything in my 62 years of life! I've been in war, served in the U.S.M.C., rank of Staff Sergeant was the highest I made it to til my service was over! I will say this that for my area, they do well by me. Maybe the difference is the places we are at but they are stellar in my eye!", "Comcast is literally the most pathetic excuse of an internet service known to man. I have been paying for 50mbps for years now, and I barely ever get anything more than 5mbps. Often it drops down to 0.3 mbps! I've called many times, and every time I call they tell me I'd have to PAY for a technician to come over. What sort of scam are they running? It's unfortunate there isn't a different ISP for my area, otherwise I'd leave these crooks instantly.", "They just don't care, even though they are all over the news for bad customer service - this company does not care. I am a new customer and I am already thinking of moving to a different service provider. When I set up my service they promised one thing. When I get the email confirmation it\u2019s different and when the technician is here to install it\u2019s a whole different story. I had to call them 6 times to reach the correct department. They just keep transferring me all over the place and the customer service reps are so rude. The next time I call them is to cancel my service and it is pretty soon.\r\n", "I'm 31 years old. I was actually around for the advent of the Internet. I remember how slow a 56k dial-up phone modem was, and trust me, Comcast/Xfinity is slower!! On average, I get speeds of no more than 0.4mb/s and my ping is absolutely outrageously horrible!! Furthermore, the Internet cuts out constantly, forcing me out of my games and videos, and I can't stream ANYTHING on it, NOT EVEN YOUTUBE!! Comcast/Xfinity is absolutely the worse thing on the market that a person can buy and what's worse? They're the only Internet provider in my area. There's literally NOBODY else I can go to. If I still had the modem, hookup, and drivers for it, I'd install a 56k modem in a heartbeat and finally enjoy a fast internet service!! This is pure, undiluted, crap!! AVOID COMCAST/XFINITY AT-ALL-COSTS IF YOU CAN!!\r\n", "I have to admit, comcast had us hooked for the first month. We bought a faster internet package; our DL speeds were sometimes faster than advertised! But after a month or two, that was no longer the case. From 50Mbps to around 10Mbps on good days and with very high ping, I tried to have customer support help us. One even told us that \"6Mbps is included in your package\". What!? The customer support is marginal, but cannot fix the problem. Right now, we are paying for a service that we are not receiving. Comcast, please pay more attention to your customers.", "I made the mistake of returning to Comcast after leaving years before for terrible customer service. I'll admit I was intrigued by their ads for Xfinity and decided to give it a try. In (((theory only))) the service was great. In reality... nothing worked as promised. The callerID was the first to give me problems; some days it worked... others, it didn't. Next, the on Demand became unpredictable. I lost entire seasons of \"recorded shows!\" ...and sometimes (in the middle) of playing back\r\na recorded, it would just STOP and give me an \"error\" message. \r\n\r\nThe problems continued over a (2) month period. Too many trouble-shooting phone calls to count; ALL of which were directed to a call center in the Philippines! No less than (4) technicians came to my home, with three DIFFERENT explanations for my issues: Maintenance... Software... Neighborhood Interference...etc. A REAL NIGHTMARE!! ...and to add misery to mayhem... After discussing the problems with BILLING department and being 'assured' that my service was in no danger of interruption, my service was disconnected! So, my advice to you... just SAY NO TO XFINITY! The branding is new but the lack of customer service is still the SAME ole Comcast!", "I've finally been able to be passed further down the line in this mess Comcast has created. I got one great rep to help remove some of the fraudulent charges, however older ones were still listed on their online bill. I was given a number to call for my dispute with the deposit, but the number said they temp shut my service till I paid the $100 to have it turned back on. (No mention if this was a deposit and since I paid all my bills on time what was owed this = extortion and breech of contract). In fact the number leads to a loops for payment through credit card and even though it says hold for a live rep the same message plays over and over trying to get credit card and payment info.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a second number to try and resolve this. I had reached what claimed to be an executive support through writing one of the upper customer service managers and they called me a few times giving me a number that wasn't listed as Comcast and that number was just an answering machine each time I called and when leaving a message they never called back. Within this time I received a weird bank phishing email in my Comcast mail acct which nobody has my add for and it had no TO: info filled out, which is necessary in sending a message, so I checked the detail info on sender etc. and it was coming from a Comcast internal email.\r\n\r\n\r\nI plan on handing this info to the Executive support if I ever actually get a hold of them, to trace the ISP number and info along with their internal codes to see if this is an attempt to steal money from people's bank accounts as the work of their own employees or third parties they contract and give our info to. I also have specific details on my last check and letter stating they cannot cash my last check unless they admit I am paid in full and fix their fraudulent charges, therefore if they cash the last check after trying to extort $100 from me and shutting me off then they are literally stealing from my bank account and I will have the clear evidence whether they help decipher the weird bank phishing scam mail or not.\r\n", "Internet service went down so I called Comcast. It will take 7 days to have a service tech come to my home to fix problem. Stay away from Comcast. I'm dropping them.", "I have a internet/cable bundle. I was receiving reception for approx. 60 channels for four months. All of a sudden, two days ago, they cut the reception by about 20 channels without any notice!

Worst service EVER!!!!", "Got a new Comcast internet connection. The internet cuts in and out and does not work all the time. I spoke to Comcast 4 times over the last week and still I get the run around. Comcast is the worst cable internet service and if I have a choice I would never use it.", "I received a call in November 2014 saying that I should upgrade my Modem. They told me to go on this site ** and depending on which item you pick allowed up to click to buy straight from Amazon.com. And that's exactly what I did and bought a used one. Unfortunately, that's what I did. 3 hours on the phone, 2.5 hours at the customer service office, I still cannot register my modem. A legit modem that I bought from a Amazon reseller online. Their advice? You should have bought a new and paid full price. Why did you buy used? Honey, you gave me the link and I bought the used one because it was 50% off and it was an option. Don't patronize me! I pay my bills on time, just let me register this online. This regionalization of buying modems and monopolizing a market is frustrating to consumers.", "Everyday it seems like they have a connection problem. The customer service experience was the worst consumer experience I have ever dealt with. DO NOT do business with Comcast. They do nothing to help you. Just a lot of lip service.", "This has been an on-going issue w/Comcast. Our services in the area of Patterson, CA has been unstable. Regardless as to if you're signed up for 100 mbps+ download speed you will get anywhere between 2-20mbps of the actually download speeds provided. There are calls made not just by me, but my neighbors and just about everyone I speak within Patterson about this issue and nothing is being done to resolve it. They may resolve it one day, but it reoccurs 4-5 times per month and it's very frustrating for paying customers as they're not getting the speeds they should be getting. And practically every night after 8pm until 6-7am the speeds will always drop to around 2-5 mbps. They will send a tech in the morning to take a look at this and of course, every time the tech comes the issue is gone (makes you wonder). \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, they've blocked all competition in the area for other ISP providers to compete against their monopoly of the area so you can't just switch service. There's only one service here that offers over 15 mbps service and that's unfortunately Comcast. The top rated worst cable provider in based on both BBB and Consumer Affairs and nothing is being done about this monopoly. Them buying Time-Warner will only make matters that much worse for other people across the United States.", "So I used to be pretty pleased with our comcast internet speeds, but it wasn't long before we started noticing slower connection speeds at peak hours rather than boosts in speeds, which we are being charged for. It's frustrating to be paying over $100 for an internet connection that won't even load a webpage. Oh, and you better hope you don't have an actual technical problem because they will bounce you around from call center to call center suggesting variations on turning off the router and turning it back on. Yes my router is on and yes I have power cycled it. Do you have any actual \"expert\" advice? No? Got it. They have a monopoly on the area I live in and no incentive to provide more reliable service or tech support. It's my fault for not checking to see if there were any other ISPs in the area. I also doubt you'll find a more reliable alternative though, because most ISPs treat their customers this way. So disappointing. Hopefully this will go through eventually if the page loads.", "Comcast wanted customers to upgrade their modems with their new ones. I did that. They mailed the new modem to me. It was a self install but I could not do it so I called and had them send a technician out to install and had to pay for that. That was fine but after that the WIFI in the modem never worked properly - I kept being drop while using my tablet or Netflix. I called for months regarding this. Comcast had me calling other places and doing things. Finally just before the Holidays I called Comcast once again and someone there said, \"Well let me check into something.\" And whatever he did he informed me that the WIFI in the modem was defective and it needed to be replaced. They had to send another new modem. \r\n\r\nI told them at the time \"But I need someone again to come out and install it.\" And I told them I did not want to pay a second time to have another one installed. Each time I spoke to the Service department and to billing and I made sure to check into it I was told there would not be a charge since it was due to Comcast's defective modem. Well lo and behold when I get my bill they not only charged me a 15.00 shipping for another modem they charged me a service charge for the technician a second time and taxes on top of everything. \r\n\r\nI called to speak with a supervisor and they were not going to credit me. Also saying no notes on my account which I thought very strange since there should have been many notes since I called them on many occasions. I finally was able to get a credit of 50.00 only on a 88.17 charge. I am very upset about this and will eventually change providers. Hoping AT&T will come my way asap. Beware, Comcast has terrible customer service and has no problem outright lying to a customer to turn around and get them in the back. Their price are also outrageous.", "I'm so very upset at the price increase forced on all of us. I don't have cable so I've been hit with a $21.00 price increase per month. I only have internet & a land line. I heard all the spiel on how I was in a time line of a 2 year contract, 2014. B.S. I've only had it for one year. No employee could tell me what happened to the other year? My bill went up regardless. I hate cable company monopolies. We are all going to come up short in the end.\r\n", "In early September my Comcast phone, TV and internet service had deteriorated and was spotty - TV channels not coming in and the phone not working. And the internet slowed down too. So a tech came out and determined that the Comcast cable line from the street to my house was badly worn and needed to be replaced.\r\nHe made a call and told me that the repair would be done between September 25th and October 9th. But they never showed, never called, and I never heard from Comcast until October 9th when I received an email informing me that the new repair date was October 16th. But they never showed for that one either and I never heard from them. \r\n\r\nTo make a long story not so long, they also missed the next two appointments, the latest was yesterday October 21st. Never showed, never contacted me. Today I got an email from them stating that the repair was now rescheduled to be completed by November 13th. Today is October 22nd and this has been going on since early September and nothing's been done. And didn't think of it but no one ever gave me an order number either.", "I'm going to be accurate and fair. The individual I initially called to send technical support over was nice, patient and helpful; unfortunately, the support itself was not. He comes into our door with his first words being \"I parked in the 20 min spot, so this better be quick. I don't want a ticket.\" No name introduction? Kay. After taking a look at our modem, he concluded that there was nothing he could do and that wifi was a luxury, so we'll just have to deal with it. Pardon me, what? I'm usually very understanding, but I just can't comprehend why Comcast would hire employees that represent their company in that manner. I'm disappointed, and will keep this encounter in mind going forward. What a waste of bill payments.", "In August, I changed from my DVR service, the shiny new X1 platform. What a complete piece of crap. I have struggled with it for 3 months now. The equipment in 3 locations in my house was fouled up every other day, I kid you not. I have LESS functionality than I had with the DVR! I finally called them to move back to my old DVR equipment. No problem! But I either have to pay $70 for a service call, or drive clear across town (Denver area) to switch out the equipment. I work like most of us, and their service center is only open during my work hours, no weekend hours. So I would have to blow off 2 to 3 hours to accomplish this. I finally kept complaining, and they agreed to ship the new equipment at no cost. \r\n\r\nSo, now is where the fun starts. They sent me 4 boxes. One is the central box, the other are satellite, like X1. The master box is the only one with pause or rewind capability during a show. You can only set recordings from the main box. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? No different from X1 except it's not based on an internet connection. And get this...the equipment doesn't work! I can either go to the service center, or they can once again ship new equipment, or I can wait for 5 days for a service call. And I can't watch any TV. \r\n\r\nI have a long fuse, I believe in solving disputes in a reasonable and respectful fashion. I am always courteous. But I'm at the end of my rope with Comcast. I'm a raving mad customer who would love to fire them, but I can't because they have the monopoly. Comcast is pure evil. My frustration has brought me to tears. The only reasonable thing I can say is their staff is pleasant. They just can't fix the problem or do anything to compensate you. I genuinely HATE THEM. If you have a choice, any pick is better than Comcast.\r\n", "I have never received such horrific customer experience ever. After being a customer for over 2 years I noticed my bill increasing little by little. My bill started out at $119.00 and then the second year $139.00 and now $179.00. I called to inquire why my bill had increased since my contract was over. After being on hold numerous times for more than 20 minutes each and hung up on I opted to close my account.

I will attach my receipt when I can get it off my email.", "On Sunday, Dec. 21, 2014, my internet suddenly went out. I was told that the problem was in the wiring and they would have to send a technician. What had happened was that my next door neighbor moved and instead of disconnecting her line, they disconnected mine. Not only was I without internet for two days (which I use for my work), they billed me for the call! The technician put some codes on the work order that said they made some changes to the wiring in my house. All they did was screw the cable back onto the box. I was standing there when he did it.\r\n\r\nWhen I called customer service they offered to waive half the fee, which tells me that they knew they had screwed up. When I told them that in essence they were billing me for their error, they said they could only go by what was on the paperwork (a copy of which the tech did not leave me). I went up two levels at customer service to a senior supervisor, who told me that if it was up to him he \"would bill me for the whole thing,\" because I'd taken up so much of his colleague's time. This is the second incident in less than a year that I have lost income due to Comcast. Two months ago my modem started failing and I had to take it to the branch for a replacement or pay for a service call for THAT. I've only had this service since April 11th -- less than a year!", "I tried to stay loyal for years with Comcast because they used to be somewhat fair. Now they are just extremely greedy. I have used another Internet provider for years. Called clear communications, which weren\u2019t the greatest but it was only $20.00 a month. Well every time I called into Comcast they would try to push their Internet on me. \r\n\r\nThis one lady was so desperate for the sale she wouldn't take no for an answer and she tricked me by saying, \"Will you at least try it under no obligation?\" I was on vacation at the time and wanted to wait until I got home and advised her I would call back. She advised me that I needed to be put in that day to get the deal. She said the equipment wouldn't be sent until I returned home and called. I agreed and then I got home and called to tell them that I changed my mind and wasn't interested. \r\n\r\nThey billed me every month for a year for the Internet and the equipment and I never had any equipment in my house or the Internet ever. I called every month for a year and spent hours and hours trying to get them to remove it. They would just talk over you or run you around in circles with some bogus excuse until you were exhausted. I continued to pay because I didn't want this to hit my credit. I then got so frustrated I stopped paying that portion of the bill until it was resolved. They just added late charges every month. I finally just stopped paying the bill and will dispute it later. \r\n\r\nI've had it with their bullying tactics and refusal of customer service. They are like Wal-Mart. Made all their money and now have most people brain washed that they have the cheapest product and then they slowly increase the price and throw in misc. charges. Comcast you have lost this customer forever. I will find another way!\r\n", "Worst customer service ever. I have been dealing with an issue since March 2012 when I purchased a modem from Saveology.com to use at my residence for internet use. Months later noticed the bill was too high. Called Xfinity, in Oct of 2013 and was told that it was their mistake, they couldn't refund my money past 2 months but I was given a decent package for my trouble. Well last month again (Oct 2013), I noticed my bill was high and once again called about it, only to find that I was being charged a leasing fee for that same modem. I was told that it was taken care of, no future charges will be charged, and again, no total refund was offered. I was pissed and told my neighbor who works at Comcast and he gave me a card. \r\n\r\nI called the card tonight (11-17-2014), only to find that that lease charge is still on my account! Doug ** told me that it is being audited and there is nothing he can do without a receipt. He could not produce a record other than a order number that was originally in error. He said that he trusts that order number shows that I ordered a modem from Xfinity. I checked my records on gmail (Thank God for that storage) and found the receipt. \r\n\r\nI told people over at Xfinity over and over again, \"the customer is always right! Why are you doing this? You make me never want to use this company again!\" He responded with he cannot just give the modem away, even though paying $109 plus $8 a month puts this modem at around $300 that is giving it away! Advice if you are going to use this company don't use paperless billing, save your receipts and  don't expect anything from their customer service because they will tell you one thing and another will happen. Either they don't know, or they are lying. I hope that the regional manager for Xfinity Colorado sees this and has the guts to send a written letter of apology and give me a full refund.", "Wow, here I am another victim of Comcast.

The lady name by April said my internet speed is slow because they send me to the collection department. I asked her how can I keep paying for the service I never received? She transfer my call to Ted. He apologized and said he left a note on my account for credit before transfer me to tech support. I spoke with Diane, she was very friendly and helpful. After been help, she transfer me back to Mrs. Sonia at the billing department. Sonia was very disrespectful. She called me a liar and said there is NO note left in my file. I asked her to transfer me to another agent who can help me and she hang up the phone. This the first time in my life that someone humiliates me. Comcast agent need more training.", "I am so angry with Comcast it isn't even funny. For the last year I have had intermittent service interruptions with my internet. They have sent me modems, they have sent Techs and nothing seems to fix the problem. Every time I call I get a different answer. In fact the Tech who was here again today had to ask why the modem was acting so crazy saying \"I've never seen it do this before\". The Tech did nothing and I'm just waiting for my internet to go down again. Then I talked to some guy who offered me a $20 credit after I was promised a large credit. Insulting after a year of this. If Comcast and the Time Warner merge goes through we will be screwed. Ma Bell all over again.", "I went to fort Myers fl office and requested the 19.99 internet special... I was informed the speed of 3Mbs was not adequate for internet or Netflix. THE FIRST LIE. I was informed that i would need the 25 Mbs and would also receive many wonderful channels. The SECOND AND THIRD LIE. I was informed that if i was not happy with the service that i could cancel with no charge or change - THE FOURTH LIE. I changed to what i originally wanted, the 3 MBS and it works fine. I was however charged the full amount of the $55.00 for the first month as the service is suddenly.... prorated. The fifth lie. I will cancel and strongly warn everyone to avoid this corrupt corporation. ", "Comcast/xfinity is a nightmare. If anyone can avoid them avoid them like a plague. They are deceptive, lying, manipulative, horrible slap-you-in-the-face business practices. They actually tell reps to lie, to be deceptive. Otherwise they can lose their jobs. Don't work for them. They will only steal the real true person you are and want to be. Only liars work for them. If you are a son or daughter of the great 'decepter' then you belong there.\r\n\r\nFrom day 1 they've overcharged me on things.

I switched from AT&T because my AT&T bill went too high and I wanted to have my internet-cable within the budget. I called Comcast and spoke to a customer rep who first promised a flat $39 rate and no charges for installation or technician services. Besides I was offered a 50GB internet as part of the deal. I was OK with the service although my internet was very unstable and slow but I believed it was my building that was slowing down the signal. It took me for surprise when I got my bill with charges for $40 for technician, moreover I realized that I never got the 50GB but instead 25GB. I called approximately to complain and they didn't do anything to fix my bill. They offered me to increase my internet from 25 to 50GB at not cost. Never happened. What they did is charged me $10.00 every month for a service I never got. Every month I have to call to ask to correct the bill. I will switch to any provider in a short time frame.", "I subscribed to triple play three months ago. I didn't realize at the time I was signing on for a two year contract as that was never discussed, so basically I'm stuck and I've been told that by one of their reps.

I have to set aside at least 1 hour 45 minutes for each phone call before I get someone to \"help\". As I am typing this I am waiting for a tech to come to my house. The appt was from 9-1. I have also been on the phone for 45 minutes with Comcast. They are telling me tech has been to house and resolved issue (not the case). Their automated service says appt is for tomorrow from 9-11, which was discussed, but I explained I would not be home and it would have to be Monday so he gave me Monday 9-1 and gave me a confirmation number. Now at 12:29 they will see if they can get a tech out. They will call me back when they know. Another day wasted. If anyone wants triple play service go to Verizon. Run from Comcast.", "They refused to give me next day appointment. They showed up 3 business days later... Agent was refusing to connect me with supervisor saying there was no supervisor he could connect me to. Then after 5 minutes of a UN-happy customer, he decides to transfer me to a supervisor.

When it's working, both the upload and download speeds are great, but the reliability is just plain terrible. We have to reboot the wireless router at least once a week and have had the service go down completely for hours at a time on several occasions in the past 6 months. When you call \"customer service\" you can't reach anyone and often the company IVR doesn't work at all and hangs up on you. \r\n\r\nIn the 11 years we had DSL prior to switching to Comcast Internet, we had 4 outages and had to reset the wireless modem maybe once every several months.

We need far more competition to encourage and ensure reliable and affordable Internet service.", "Roku informed me I did not have internet access. I called Comcast. At every step I was required to provide my phone, address, and last 4 of my social. This was magnified as my call was repeatedly \"dropped\" and I had to start over with reps who were patronizing and difficult to understand at times.

No argument no getting crazy just blocked!..we found this out by calling from a different phone.. So tonight we called from a different phone because the account number, my cell phone was blocked.. It said our bill of $189 was paid a couple days ago!!..hmmm odd ...So we contact Comcast and I'll be darn if they didn't have our account mixed up with another customer!! This I found out after they started telling me all about this other account!!!\r\n\r\nSo after (I) figure this out the guy (mark) says there's nothing they could do, it was sent to collections!!!..wait WHAT!!!!!...So needless to say the collection place they go through was closed..go figure...

Regardless as to if you're signed up for 100mbps+ download speed you will get anywhere between 2-20mbps of the actually download speeds provided. There are calls made not just by me, but my neighbors and just about everyone I speak with in Patterson about this issue and nothing is being done to resolve it. They may resolve it one day, but it reoccurs 4-5 times per month and it's very frustrating for paying customers as they're not getting the speeds they should be getting. And practically every night after 8pm until 6-7am, the speeds will always drop to around 2-5mbps. They will send a tech in the morning to take a look at this and of course, every time the tech comes, the issue is gone (makes you wonder). \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, they've blocked all competition in the area for other ISP providers to compete against their monopoly of the area so you can't just switch service. There's only one service here that offers over 15mbps service and that's unfortunately Comcast. The top rated worst cable provider in based on both BBB and Consumer Affairs and nothing is being done about this monopoly. Them buying Time-Warner will only make matters that much worse for other people across the United States.", "I have been troubled by the speed Comcast providing for the whole duration of my 1 year contract. Contracted up to 50 mbps. However, the speed was initially good, but will quickly get down to single digit. I called Comcast multiple times per month. Every time, they made me go through the same same ritual: \"recycle\" the router, which also takes out my phone. Then I called in again, then they did one same thing - \"re-provision\" my internet service. That is their name for the one click of button they did at their end. The re-provisioning always brought the speed back up to 50+. In one minute, while I was still on the phone with Comcast tech support, the speed went way up. This pattern shows Comcast knew what the problem is and know how to fix it. But they just pretend not so by having me going through all the regular steps. In addition, they don't fix the real problem. The re-provisioning is just a temporary fix. They might just grab the bandwidth from another consumer and provided to me. And when other calls, they will grab my bandwidth away. My speed will drop back to single digit, or even 0.5 mbps after a day or two. Sometimes after as quickly as half an hour.\r\n\r\nI read so many complaint about Comcast on this site. I noticed that the complaints are across geographic location in the US. Comcast is cheating all over the country. Comcast service is expensive. I spent over $60 per month for the service. There should be a CLASS ACTION lawsuit against Comcast for breaching their contract with subscribers. The legal action is warranted because of the magnitude of the offense!", "Hidden Fees are everywhere. They are trained not to answer your questions regarding fees/credits/etc, it's ridiculous.

I started using the Comcast online pmt system since Dec. 2013. It worked, then suddenly one month, it didn't go through. I called to complain and they removed the $25.00 fee. Well, it happened again in Dec of 2014, and I called telling them I've been using the same account numbers and it didn't go through. So I get the fee charge again. I explained that the account numbers are the same and they pop up automatically when I go to type them in, so how could I put in a wrong number? My bank didn't make a mistake, and I didn't make a mistake. It is THEIR system that made the mistake. They refused to take the charge off and I switched to paper billing. DO NOT USE THE ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEM! IT IS FRAUDULENT!", "I was told by a customer representative, over the phone, that I would be paying for 25Mbps as part of their special promotion. They also told me that the promotion would end in 12 months with a 30 day money back guarantee. With good faith in the company, I continued to pay for 6 months under the impression I was getting just that. For awhile I thought slow speeds were a result of too many people in my apartment being on at once. However, after doing a few checks, I began to get suspicious and it turns out my internet had been changed to 3Mbps for months now. It seems that if it's not in writing, they can say anything to get you to fork your money over. I will be canceling their service after this billing period. What an awful sales tactic.", "I have been screwed over twice now by Comcast and their Autopay malfunctioning and me having no idea why that would happen.

They cut my internet off today. Apparently, someone in the departments changed my address and due to the same address being used by someone else, they were unable to reconnect my service. I spent well over 6 hours talking to different people who claim they would fix and they did not. When I was finally fed up and asked to cancel, they told me I wouldn't be able to cancel unless I called back the next day.

Never had internet or the channels in our package. A week later they send a tech that got our master bedroom working on cable and internet. After peaking in the attic where they were working I noticed one of my roof trusses laying there. Guess he didn't have time to reinstall it. They offered nothing to us. I had to repair the remaining two cable outlets myself that weren't working because the tech sent out disconnected them to make only two rooms operate on basic. Xfinity is awful. We still have not received our original offer. If you have any other provider, choose wisely. We are in central Florida. Good luck.", "Comcast sent out a letter to notify me of a new modem upgrade.

Otherwise the company will mail it out for me. I was next transferred to the person who would set me up to receive the modem by mail when she tells me I have to pay $15 for them to mail me out a new modem which they mandate I get. The letter, call and the person I spoke to just before Marcela said it was free to mail it to me and I install it. So, Comcast would like to charge me for doing their job of installing and exchanging their outdated equipment and I should pay for the 6 to 10 days that I do not have service. Yep, that is the way Comcast does business.", "I signed up for Comcast Internet when I moved into my new home, and was overjoyed to have fast internet again after being without it for a few months. I signed up for their 50mbps Blast! plan, and had a tech come install it, but used my own modem. Everything was just fine until 7 days in, I received an e-mail from Comcast warning me that I was near my \"data cap\". I was utterly confused and immediately logged in to my account to find out what it was referring to. I had never even HEARD of any company having a data cap on their internet service.\r\n\r\nSure enough, 7 days in, I was at 268 GB out of the 300 GB allowed. I instantly saw red. I did some research and was horrified to learn of their data cap policies and getting charged overages. I wasn't even using what I considered a large amount of data. Even with their highest internet tier, the cap is only 600 GB. with 50+ mbps, that is frighteningly simple to surpass in just days. All of the information I acquired about their cap was from forums. There was little to no useful information on their actual website to better inform me as to what my options were.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how it is even legal to instill such an abysmal cap in the first place, much less not make you aware of such a thing until you are virtually past it. This data cap combined with TERRIBLE customer service, almost daily e-mails reminding me about my bill (which obviously was never paid), and other shady tactics they use to rob people of hundreds of dollars, forced me to switch to a company with a substantially lower internet speed. I have no data cap however, and am still perfectly able to use the internet for everything I need/want on a daily basis. My opinion is that everyone else should do the same to give Comcast and companies like them to put an end to this kind of nonsense, and actually serve their customers, instead of mistreat/cheat them.

Then I started getting messages that I couldn't open the web page, not even the Comcast home page. I called for a technician and he came Friday morning at 8:00 AM. It was like if his coming over was magic. The internet worked like a rocket. Two hours later it was back to waiting, and more waiting.

I could write up a thousand adjectives about their service and only about two would be positive. My current internet is atrocious, first of all, it is the slowest internet I've seen in my entire life, it must be comparable to dial up connection. Next, the biggest problem is that the internet resets itself after every five minutes or so, so every single one of my devices loses all of their internet and that becomes unbearable when working on something (it will probably be lost when writing this complaint, leaving me to start over). It will kick me off of Xbox Live completely after every 5 minutes, my Kindle is always in a reconnecting state because by the time it finally connects again, it's lost right away.

They cannot locate my introductory offer stipulations, even though I have the offer right in front of me. Numerous calls to their customer service department proved futile with inexperienced reps ringing their hands, not knowing what to say or how to fix the problem.

All they could say or respond with (via message in front of you on your screen) was press restart and the problem you've encountered MAY be fixed.

Our internet is very slow (18) even though she pays for high speed which is supposed to be 105. Now Comcast has turned off the service to her house because of non payment.

December I paid 6 mos. ahead to come back to a horror in my Comcast bill. So doing research into why and how I could be behind I found that in September 28 or 29th of 2013 I made a payment of $130.22 that was never credited to my bill - which snowballed into me being behind. So that meant my December 6 mo. payment wasn't right either according to Comcast. Since then I called several times with no success. I just kept getting more fees late charges even though they told me my bill was on hold until this was resolved. So Comcast kept shutting me off while they were supposed to be finding out where my money went. \r\n\r\nI paid their fees just to keep my service on and I'd get more fees. I paid over a years worth of service fees that I could of paid and had over a years worth of service in just a couple months. I'd pay the bill and they would shut off my service. I'd call, they'd shut it back off. They shut it off 3 times in one day. I'd call and the person I talk to would say, \"I see no reason for your service to be off.\" They were doing anything and everything to get me to forget it all! I contacted the executives in PA, Daniel, he completely blew me off after he asked all my info and wasted my time for a half hour on the phone, told me he couldn't do anything to help me because someone else had it!!! He was like, \"I can restore your service.\" I was like, \"I have service, well when I got off the phone I didn't have service anymore even with a paid bill.\" So the person he said I had to call was Andrea **. I have talked to her several times. Nothing done. \r\n\r\nWhen this started they had asked me to send proof to Comcast so to the office it went in hand and had them fax it right from Comcast on Clippert Street Lansing MI. Well they closed it, they claim they never got it. So I sent it to Andrea the bank statements, nope not good enough. So I went back to the bank, got it on letter head and sent it again along with every credit card I had been at the same bank 20 yrs. The bank said for Comcast to call them, they refused. Because I have all the proof they stole my money and they owe me all the fees they charged me along with compensation for shutting me off several times. \r\n\r\nThey also took it upon themselves to remove me from internet essentials and put me on a more expensive plan and charge me 70.00. I called internet essentials, they put it back, that was a few days after I found out what they had done. So to this day I've got nothing but a big blow off.

After multiple calls, a tech rep finally admitted to me that my Internet box was obsolete and needed to be replaced. When I asked why I had not been notified about this problem I was told that CC had to inform the citizens of California before they informed the citizens of New Mexico. It is also curious as to why it took multiple time consuming calls to finally arrive at the truth with this company. It appears as though Hollywood is more important to CC than Albuquerque.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat tech rep stated that he would be mailing a new box out that day. After one week I had not received the new box and called yet again. I discovered that the box had never been mailed. The box arrived over one month after my original call to CC.

Finally I call back to be told that the technician came but it was an outside service (WTF!?) and everything is working now. I tell the CSR, repeatedly, I HAVE NO INTERNET CONNECTIONS period in my apartment; an \"outside\" job does nothing for me if it doesn't make its way inside... which it didn't, because no one showed up anyway.\r\n\r\nSo I make another appointment. I literally spent 30 minutes on the phone to schedule it. Today, the day of the appointment arrives. Take a half-day off work and wait. I decide to call to confirm and lo and behold...NO APPOINTMENT. The girl I'm talking to proceeds to lie to me about my Tuesday appointment...saying that someone did come (a fact that was refuted by the last person I talked to) and that I have no appointment on file...I asked her if I could speak to a manager to try to get this resolved because each time I talk to one of the CSRs nothing happens, she says \"oh yes, sure, of course.\" And then hangs up on me. I wasn't even going to complain about her... I called back to actually put in a complaint and am told there's no record of who I talked to less than 3 minutes earlier.\r\n\r\nI briefly worked a call center job while in grad school abroad, I know for a fact it sucks been people call in angry, so I try to be reasonable when I do call in. But seriously, I have never in my life been so frustrated dealing with CSRs in my life. I give up. I'd rather pay more elsewhere. The only thing that's good about this is that I was able to cancel my service (in store) and return my unused equipment free of charge because I am still in the 30-day money back guarantee period.\r\n", "This is a follow up to my first Comcast review for November 7th, 2014. That Comcast install was a 'No Show\" and a complete waste of time. I am an IT guy and my friends who were having the install done at their new home asked me to come over to be a second set of eyes for the install, and to check and connect their computers once the Comcast install was completed. After the first Comcast install \"no show\" on Nov 7th, 2014, my friends a significant amount of time on the phone re-initiating the install order and rescheduling the install for the following Wednesday, Nov 12th, 2014. The Comcast installer technician was scheduled to arrive between 8 AM to 10 AM that morning. I arrived about 8:30 AM. The Comcast technician had not yet arrived. Then time marched on... 9 AM, then 9:30 AM... so we called again. SIDE NOTE: Earlier that morning, my friend called Comcast and they confirmed, and Comcast actually called her back again to CONFIRM that the technician would be there between the scheduled time block of between 8 AM and 10 AM that morning.\r\n\r\nSo here we were, once again, at 9:30 AM and no Comcast installer technician. We called Comcast. Got the nice man on the phone named Alberto, based in their Monterrey, Mexico office, 2,000 miles away from Chicago, IL, who, to the best of his ability, tried to nicely explain that the technician would be there and that they would call us within 30 minutes. No call. I called Comcast back. Got the same guy, Alberto, who said that yes, he had the order, but no ETA on the technician arriving... I asked to speak to his supervisor, he said I could not, but that Jose, his supervisor, would call me back within 15 minutes. I also asked Alberto for a phone number for their Local Dispatch office so I could call and follow up myself, but Alberto could not/would not give me that information; citing that it was not within their operating protocol to give out that information(?). Alberto kept insisting that the install technician would arrive by 1:16 PM (NOT 1 pm OR 1:15 pm, IT WAS 1:16 pm!). So once again, we waited. No supervisor call 15 minutes later. NO follow up call(s) from anyone. No technician. At 1:16 PM no technician. No install, no technician, for a THIRD TIME! No follow up calls. Nothing.\r\n\r\nFinally, we called At&T, who took all of our information, set up the appointment for the next day, and yes, the AT&T tech called me and my friends one hour before his install, he arrived on time, got the install done, checked everything, and now my friends are in business, with AT&T... at a price and value package offering more services for a lower price than the original Comcast deal that had attracted my friends in the first place.\r\n\r\nI cannot stress enough that Comcast MUST address this serious communications, scheduling and performance issue, at least here in the Chicago, IL region and get it fixed. There is no excuse for a huge company like Comcast/NBC Universal to have such lousy service. I hope they take these reviews seriously... otherwise, all I and so many others can assume is that they simply don't give a damn about getting new customers. How they can stay in business this way is beyond me. Huge company or not, they also are asking for multiple lawsuits to happen if they have not already!\r\n\r\nI will NEVER, EVER, deal with Comcast again. And, I have my customers of mine, friends, contacts, who often call me for recommendations on what company to go with for new internet, TV, phone service... guess which company I am going to recommend? IT AIN'T GOING TO BE COMCAST!!! Comcast, you have got to get it right. There is NOTHING WORSE than blowing off NEW customers, and not even being able to fulfill initial installation orders. Absolutely unforgivable and a complete insult to potential new customers!\r\n", "Signed up for X1 Blast package not quite 2 weeks ago. Was told install was free & I would not receive a bill until 30 days after I started my service. I was told install tech would be here the next day between 5 & 7 pm. I was given my phone number and paid my deposit for all 3 service.\r\n\r\nThe day of the install I received a call saying something went wrong on their end and they would have to reschedule my install for 2 days later. I was not happy with that. I was able to get the next day instead, so I was ok with it. They had to run my deposit again. I confirmed that the phone number they gave me was still going to be the same as original they gave me. I explained I was ordering new card & t-shirts with the new number and wanted to make sure there was no chance of the number being different. I was assured that the number was the same. So I placed my order.\r\n\r\nThe next day when tech showed up I was informed that the number was a different number! After about 4 phone calls and almost 3 hours on the phone with I forget how many different operators trying to get a supervisor, because the operators did not have the authority to correct the number. I just spent 1000.00 on my order! I could not change it due to a mistake on my end. The Supervisor was able to correct it! I was very happy.\r\n\r\nNot even 2 weeks go by and I get a email from Xfinity saying my video bill was due???? So I watch it and I'm thinking maybe a tutorial on my video bill. WRONG!!! IT WAS A BILL!!! I had a bill over $200.00. It is only supposed to be 112.00 including tax a month. I was charged an additional 39.95 for the installer to show up and 40.00 for hooking 2 cable lines to 2 box's 20.00 a box! So install was 89.95. My house was already wired and ready. I was also charged for half a month's service and tax. \r\n\r\nI called and was informed that the info the 1st operator told me was not true that they always bill 2 weeks after service and I would get another bill in a few days for a full month service. That on occasions they do offer free install but it was not in my notes. So there was no chance of getting that removed from my bill. I requested that they pull the recording of my conversation with the original representative. I was told it was possible that it was not recorded. HMMM... Imagine that!!\r\n\r\nShe said she would put in a request for her manager to remove the $40.00 but the manager was off till Monday, it was Friday. I was also told that if it was removed it would come off the next bill statement not the current one. She recommended I pay it all now. That the next bill may be adjusted! She said she would call me Tuesday to let me know the decision. It is now Saturday and I have already received another email telling me my bill was due AGAIN! I just got the first bill yesterday! It is not even due till for another 10 days! I am awaiting the call on Tuesday. Will update this on outcome!", "For the last 6 months the internet is constantly going down and when you call customer service you are on hold forever and all they do is tell you, \"Yes an outage has been reported\" and claim to credit your account but have nothing about the constant outages! If I ran my business like this I would be shut down! Where is the accountability? This company is horrible. They always tell you \"Oh the outage should be resolved in 2 to 4 hours or more!\" Then you get a call or text saying it's resolved and you try your internet and it is still down??? One time the customers service guy told me it's because a lot of people in my area are streaming and it slows the internet down??? What the heck how can this be ok?? I would never recommend Comcast. They are just as bad if not worse than AT&T.......", "In June, I signed up for the $29.99/month for the Internet Plus plan. When I received my first bill, I noticed being charged $39.99 for the service. I have contacted Comcast countless times since then, as I am still being overcharged. Despite calls, chat sessions, promises to receive callbacks, nothing has been resolved. I have even provided a screenshot of the Internet Plus promotion on Comcast.com for $29.99/month taken the day I signed up, but they refuse to honor it as it isn't a current promotion, even though it was when I signed up! The only attempts at correcting this issue were giving me faster internet and additional channels for a month each. Both of these resulted in even more additional charges to my account. \r\n\r\nAlso, as part of my promotion, I was supposed to receive a $50 Visa prepaid card after 90 days of service. Six months have gone by, and I still have not received it. Whenever I inquire about this with Comcast, I am given the same response: \"Please allow up to sixteen weeks from your installation for your Visa prepaid card to mail. The additional four weeks after the 90-day period is to account for processing.\" The two images are screenshots of the promotion for $29.99/month and my bill, reflecting the incorrect charge. To clarify my bill, it should state $69.95 - $39.96 $29.99/month promotion) + $8.00 = $37.99.", "I talk to cust. rep. last month about slow internet. They can't figure it out over the phone, offer to send someone over but never mention there's a charge... The guy shows up, takes him 3 min to fix the problem. Next month I see $70 charge on my bill. I go online, chat with an agent. He offers $70 credit.. I subtracted $70 from my bill. Next month I see the same $70 (past due). I call them, they say there is no record of anyone offering me $70... I'm pissed.. First they did not tell me there's going to be a charge, then someone lied to me about crediting my acct.. in the end they gave me $20.", "On numerous occasions my wifi has been disabled causing me to contact the company, etc. It would not be a huge deal except that I pay numerous amounts in fees and charges for the service that never actually works. I know other people have issues with WIFI and I'm surprised Comcast has not had to make amends to their overcharges and unfair practices.", "Comcast makes up fraudulent charges on people's bills and has a service system set up to give people a run around, so they never get their bills issues solved. They illegally charge for people's rights to privacy by asking for money when you refuse your Social security number. They lie and say this is for equipment to insure payments but they change the deposit fee to an actual fee on the bill then charge late fees illegally on falsified deposit money requests not received. You can't charge late fees on money that is a deposit, they do so by pretending the deposit is a charge of service by no longer announcing the deposit as such, thus allowing them to claim to not know why you owe the fee and try and get away with such charges. The billing becomes extortion and when you report the fraudulent billing to the FCC they tag on more mystery fees like suddenly they make modem fees appear even though their web site admits you have your own modem and no equipment of theirs. The Billing blames service and service dept. blames billing as a run around ensues. They try every trick imaginable to extort money and make customers have to spend time trying to fix what they refuse to fix. \r\n\r\nPrivacy violations, strong arm tactics, interference of data transmission is some of their tools to get you to drop your FCC charges and consumer complaints (they removed half of my message to the FCC the complaint section was almost all erased). They even try copyright infringement tactics to scare and try and extort more money from their customers. These magically turn up after you file your report to the FCC, but they mess up because they date the incidents on days you can prove not to even be in town with modem or electricity turned on. It's almost as if someone within the organization is sabotaging the company, embezzling money, or attacking the customers, but then I see these tactics have existed for a long time, so I think perhaps this is their everyday known practice since they are too big to prevent from doing whatever they want.\r\n\r\nUpdated on 12/28/2014:\r\n\r\nI've finally been able to be passed further down the line in this mess Comcast has created. I got one great rep to help remove some of the fraudulent charges, however older ones were still listed on their online bill. I was given a number to call for my dispute with the deposit, but the number said they temp shut my service till I paid the $100 to have it turned back on. (No mention if this was a deposit and since I paid all my bills on time what was owed this = extortion and breech of contract). In fact the number leads to a loops for payment through credit card and even though it says hold for a live rep the same message plays over and over trying to get credit card and payment info.\r\n\r\nI had a second number to try and resolve this. I had reached what claimed to be an executive support through writing one of the upper customer service managers and they called me a few times giving me a number that wasn't listed as Comcast and that number was just an answering machine each time I called and when leaving a message they never called back. Within this time I received a weird bank phishing email in my Comcast mail acct which nobody has my add for and it had no TO: info filled out, which is necessary in sending a message, so I checked the detail info on sender etc. and it was coming from a Comcast internal email.\r\n\r\nI plan on handing this info to the Executive support if I ever actually get a hold of them, to trace the ISP number and info along with their internal codes to see if this is an attempt to steal money from people's bank accounts as the work of their own employees or third parties they contract and give our info to. I also have specific details on my last check and letter stating they cannot cash my last check unless they admit I am paid in full and fix their fraudulent charges, therefore if they cash the last check after trying to extort $100 from me and shutting me off then they are literally stealing from my bank account and I will have the clear evidence whether they help decipher the weird bank phishing scam mail or not.\r\n\r\n", "Having Comcast Internet connect in Mechanicsburg is the worst part. I have been escalating to Comcast customer care at least weekly once about my Internet speed. I am paying $53 and I am getting 2 to 5 Mbps speed. Not sure what's wrong with Comcast Internet. I requesting people not to go with Comcast Internet. The worst service.", "I have been a Comcast customer for over 15 years. Customer service have declined. I had appointment March 5, 2015. They never showed nor did they give me a courtesy call. I called, inquiring about the technician. She told me he had to cancel Due to the weather. I ask the women, \"Why didn't anyone call and inform me?\" She said they did. I told her, \"No one called,\" so she reschedule for the next day. I am waiting and waiting so I called. She said, \"They're running late. They're coming.\" Another no show. I called and insisting on speaking with management. She put me on hold for forty five minutes only to get back on the phone to tell me her supervisor was too busy to answer the complaint...he would call back. The supervisor never called back. I work from home so I lost money because of this. This company is horrible. I think the problem is the language barrier.", "Called last week to complain about slow Internet (downloads about 1-2Mbs according to Bandwidthplace.com. After IDing myself to their IVR system, I repeated the info to a rep, Told about my problem. Asked all kinds of questions about the modem and router. Said that it was their equipment so they should know all about it. She couldn't help so transferred me to their \"Advanced\" support. Repeated all the ID info and then was asked about the problem. Said that they would try to fix and call back in two days.\r\n\r\nObviously, no help so I called back and they scheduled a tech to come on Sat PM. He arrived on time and checked signal strength and said the problem is in their system. Service drop is old and loss is above their standard. He would write a work order to run new service drop and increase signal strength. As you might expect, no improvement so I repeated everything early this PM and will see their service tech on Sat PM. By almost any standard Comcast is the absolute worst company in America. I just wish that the money being spent in DC to get the merger through was spent on improving infrastructure. We can only hope... ", "We just signed up for Xfinity high speed internet.

This is with their NEW Modem.", "My mother's Comcast/Infinity wifi constantly goes out, and often runs slow. They are definitely deserving of one star. I have Time Warner in New York City, which has a bad rep, but they are far better than Comcast, both in terms of internet service and customer service. Many of the Comcast customer service agents at Comcast just don't feel like helping, and there's no continuity while you're speaking to different people. You're giving them the same information over and over, explaining the problem over and over, which is frustrating. This is what monopoly creates.", "Great service.. Rarely down. Great speed options.", "We were sent a new box to update our internet connection. We spent over 2 hours on the phone trying to get it to work. We spoke to 3 different people - two of whom were very difficult to understand. The other was a very grumpy woman. They never could get it to work and decided the modem is defective. Their solution to the problem was to say that we had to take the box to the Comcast store. The only way they would send a technician was if we paid for the visit and even then they said he would not bring a box, we would still have to get a new one ourselves. We are exploring our other options for Internet connection.", "I have been doing tests for two months on my internet speed that Xfinity says is 50mb. It has NEVER been over 40mb.", "Comcast has been the only cable provider for this particular geographic area since I moved here in 1999. We had a business and bought business class high speed Internet just because of the stable IP, the speed was really bad.. We consistently had problems and the problem was never in our house. IT was always their lines. Now (2015) I need high speed internet. For years we have been using speedtest.net to calculate our speed since Comcast would NEVER tell us what speed we were buying. No wonder. We have always had a ping of about 50 ms, download speed of 8.48 mbps and upload of 0.78 mbps. Today I spoke with a technician since I am being timed out by the VA, Netflx, Xfinfity downloads, etc. He said it can't be fixed because the lines need to be replaced and Comcast has no interest in doing that. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, Verizon has customers in the east part of town and they have FIOS. I understand Comcast and Verizon decided to split this area and I am on the wrong side of the division. The tech today actually reduced my monthly fees because the speeds are so bad...he says they don't even offer these speeds anymore. I asked to be upgraded and that wasn't possible because of the lines. Just what should I do now? Dish and Hughs don't work well here either due to the amount of snow we get. I feel like I am not an American citizen anymore. I bet there are places in Africa doing better than this speed.\r\n", "They don't give you the upgrade charge right away.

They could not fix it over the phone so they scheduled an appointment to come to the house.

I was not informed before or during the appointment that there was going to be a charge. My cable bill is already close to $200.00 and I barely watch the TV. I called customer service (in the Philippines) and they tried to sell me a service plan on top of the $40.00 service charge!!! They are threatening to charge $350.00 if I cancel the service. Is this legal. I never had to pay for a service charge when I had Verizon. If it goes out again I am just going to be stuck because I do not have $40.00 to pay to have it repaired.", "I took over the lease on an apartment from another tenant recently. I also took over her Comcast Internet service contract. We both filled out the forms to transfer the account to my name. Unfortunately while Comcast transferred the account to my name they didn't bother to change the address or contact info, or the user name or password for the account so the bills kept going to the old tenant but at her new address and when I tried to access the account online to change things I couldn't get access. \r\n\r\nI tried contacting them by phone and spent almost an hour going around in circles through their terrible automated phone system, which just can't seem to deal with a situation where the account number and phone number don't match the records (that was why I was calling after all). Once I actually got to talk to a real person they passed me off between 3 different people before I talked to someone who could actually figure out my problem. Fortunately I did eventually talk to an intelligent and helpful person but I took a very long time and lots of hassles. \r\n\r\nNow a few weeks later I am trying to log in online and discovering that they still haven't changed anything and I still can't get access online. When I tried getting to an online chat with a customer service rep I found that there was some sort of glitch with their online form so that I couldn't enter my zip code or phone number properly. Both of those are required fields so I couldn't access the online rep because of the glitch in their online system. \r\n\r\nI think I have gotten around that problem for now and I am just waiting (for over half an hour at this point) to get to the head of the queue for the customer service chat. I have dealt with many different cell phones, credit card, cable, and other sorts of services over the years and I have never seen such utterly inept, incompetent, useless, and careless customer service. It is clear that Comcast believes that they have a captive audience and could care less about serving their customers. Their Internet service has been mostly OK when it has been working, but it is never especially fast or great for the amount one pays for it, and if there is a problem well, God help you, because Comcast hardly will.\r\n", "I have had an account with these morons since June!

He worked on the original thermostat for about half an hour and then left our residence without notice. The heat was not connected to the thermostat and the thermostat was hanging off of the wall when he left. After multiple attempts to contact Xfinity/Comcast, we were unable to get another technician to our residence and it was unclear whether or not they would bill us for the \"service.\" They also refused to provide a name or ID for the technician so we could file a formal complaint. My husband was on hold for almost an hour and a representative disconnected the call twice. We had to call an emergency service to fix our thermostat and hook it up to the heat which costed $75.", "I signed up for Comcast Security in December 2013, canceled in January 2014 within the 30 day period and my service was inactivated. Since then I have called to tell them that I am still being billed as recent as April 2, 2015 ($100+) a month for over 16 months. Confirmed today that my security services cannot be troubleshooted because they are inactive. Why have I paid over $1,600 for inactive service and continuing to pay because if I don't, all my other services will be disconnected as well and I need my internet so I have been forced to pay for the security service even though it has been inactive since January 2014 and confirmed again today with ** in Home Security Trouble Shooting Department that my security service is inactive but it remains on my bill. \r\n\r\nThis service has been inactive since January 2014 as noted/recorded in several calls (over 75) made to Comcast through out 2014. I was also just told today that I do not qualify for the $100 gift card that was promised to me in January - April of 2014 for all of my inconveniences (after calling in threatening to cancel all services and switch over to AT&T) and being told as early as March 31, 2015 that I did qualify for it and it was in the mail.

Sometimes they work mediocre and sometime not all. What do you do? THROW more money down the drain with calling their service man or drive over to their office and get more of their faulty products. Bent over the barrel is right! I can't wait for dsl. Maybe their service will be faster than dial up????", "The tv shuts down every night and only thing they tell me is it's a required maintenance... I mean really do you have to reboot an entire WAN every night?", "My son, who also has a Comcast internet account, recently moved back into our home. As it didn't make sense for both of us to pay for Comcast service at the same address, he called Comcast to have our account closed and the email addresses moved to his account. At this point I got on the phone with Comcast as well as I wanted to make sure there would not be any issues (we have used Comcast for over 10 years and all of our email is tied to the Comcast accounts). They assured me there would not be any problems and no disruption of service. Well... that was true for about two weeks and then without any notice our Comcast accounts were closed.\r\n\r\nI have since made 5 calls to Comcast customer support, two of those resulting in being disconnected during the calls, have had two different \"tickets\" opened to fix the problem, and have been told multiple times that it will be fixed within 24 hours. I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT EMAIL SERVICE FOR 6 DAYS AND IT STILL HASN'T BEEN FIXED. My email address is apparently no longer working and will not receive emails, and I have my bank accounts, other financial accounts, etc. all sending notifications, etc. to my email address... which Comcast can't seem to get set up again. This could turn into a major problem. For example, all of my credit card statements are sent electronically to my email account... only now I'm not getting them.\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had in trying to work with a company. One word for anyone considering the Comcast service... RUN! Run as far away as you can as they apparently have no idea how to treat a customer of 10+ years. I will call again today for the 6th time as it still isn't working, but at this point I am open to suggestions as to what it might take to get my email accounts active again. Suggestions???", "I canceled Comcast business internet and phone due to illness and business being closed. Also due to their gross mismanagement of my account requiring me to call them several times each month to straighten it out. They would take the information, say it would be taken care of, and then nothing would be done. After several complaints they got rude and unresponsive, charged my credit card even after I had changed the card (3 times) - charged me for items without sending a bill. Refuse to cancel account even after I wrote them an e-mail to their consumer service stating I was canceling. They change the bills each month and say I owe them for an early termination fee. They broke the contract first. I owe them nothing.", "Comcast sells internet packages claiming they can provide up to 50mb/sec download speeds. Their own technicians have verified that Santa Cruz (where I live) does not have the network infrastructure to provide more than 17/ms download speed, and often less. I have complained to Comcast several times and received an $18 credit on my monthly bill of $120. They have no plans to correct the infrastructure problem. This fraudulent business practice affects thousands of customers in Santa Cruz.", "We decided to upgrade our cable to HD and increase our internet speed. Comcast scheduled us with a technician to install the new x1 cable box and upgraded modem. When the technician arrived he setup the new box but did not bring a new modem. After he left our internet stopped working and I could not access the HD channels, when I select an HD channel it tells me to call and subscribe. The entire point was to upgrade to HD. Now I have no internet and still no HD. I called Comcast and after 2.5 hours and being transferred 7 times. I still have no internet and my HD channels still do not work. To top it all off they want to charge me to have another technician come out.

I am counting down the days until I move out of this apartment and can switch back to CenturyLink. My internet is INCREDIBLY slow, with regular delays. It doesn't make any difference which device I'm using -- it's always slow. Nightly, around 11pm, the internet strength reduces significantly to the point that whatever I'm watching on Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube through my AppleTV freezes, taking forever to reload, and repeating this process until I eventually give up and go to sleep. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER solicit service from Comast or Xfinity again. It's essentially useless. ** XFINITY!!!", "Please do not utilize this service. They will promise great things to get you to sign up but no customer service after up to and including outright lies. I was with DirecTV, two HD DVR's, one other HD set top and one other normal definition set top. This was bundled with phone and internet at 6Mbs. The bill for this was at $130.00 roughly.\r\n\r\nI called xfinity/comcast and they quoted me $59/month for 50Mbs internet and phone. I specifically asked that I needed to keep certain channels (espn, amc, natgeo were among these). No mention of installation costs and confirmation that there was no contract but this price was good for two years. I received my first bill of $177. Since this day the nightmare they call customer service has not been able to resolve the billing issue. They insist that I signed up for the \"triple play\" at $89/month.\r\n\r\nInternet speed averages around 7Mbs. I have called their customer service and the CSR told me that they were having lots of issues with the cisco modem/router combo and that I would get better speeds if I bought my own router and modem. I did so ($250) but the speeds did not change. I called them once again and they sent a tech out 2 days later (two hours late for appointment). He said the signal from the curb to my house was ok, but signal to the area was bad. He stated that an engineer would be send out to correct it. Next day an automated call from comcast informed me the situation was fixed but I am still at 5-12 Mbs. This issue continues...\r\n\r\nBack to tv programming: at least 8 calls have been place to resolve programming. And at each call the situation with my programming gets worse. It even seems there may be some vindication happening as they reduced my service to the basic 30 channels (all crud btw) at midnight last night. When I call them today (Sunday) they say they cannot change service as their resolution center is closed.\r\n\r\nI am a consultant and am now going to be sending invoices at a charge rate of $300/hour for every hour I spent on the phone I am not billing to my customers. 4 hours today and counting. Now it seems they have put my box into deactivated mode. They insist that they cannot restore my channels without a 2-year agreement and $135/month billing rate. Do not do business with these people!

I scheduled another appointment, as I was not able to use it coz of Comcast issue. But they charged me like some $100. Later when I called customer care and complained, they waived that off. \r\n\r\nAfter replacing the equipment in the second visit, it went fine for some time. Then new issue popped up - very frequent loss of connection and the router was going offline. Troubleshooted with remote support for more than 20 times. Their remote support is the most worthless support I have seen from many service providers. Only thing they can do is remote restart and finally asking us to manually reset the router. Two times, onsite technician came and fixed some issue with their outside switches and boxes, and it started working fine for few months. Then issue resurface again. Only thing I continue with Comcast is there is no other real alternative.", "Refuse to honor contract. It's been going on two years still having problems. They try to do the bait and switch game. Who can I contact to help me. Thank you.", "Ordered just internet service and wireless hot spots. Stopped working immediately way before I could even get my cable modem sent to me. Called in to fix and technical support either could not figure out the problem, or hung up on me, or passed me around to different departments. I stayed on the phone waiting for hours always to be hung up on or told to call back the next day and it would be fixed. Never happened. I even was given case numbers but that did not help. Then they send me the wrong cable modem and I had to drive to a store to exchange it myself as it did not work. Then back to endless hours on the phone and being passed around and hung up on.\r\n\r\nI escalated to supervisors several times that promised me they would fix the issue but no luck. I even gave up and just tried to cancel my service all together at that point (3 times) but the reps are so incompetent they could not even complete that (got passed to different departments then hung up on again). It took over 2 weeks and this is not an exaggeration, 20+ phone calls to finally get someone who knew what to do and finally get me up and running. \r\n\r\nThis person 'Ricardo' agreed I was treated unfairly and said he would definitely have billing adjust my account so I would not be charged for 2+ weeks of service I did not have and hours of frustration on the phone. He assured me he put in the proper notes and requests to adjust my billing. Well sure enough when the bill came absolutely no discounts and I was charged way more than I should have been. \r\n\r\nThis by far has been the worst customer support from a corporation I have ever experienced in my life. I have never dealt with a company so dysfunctional, disorganized, and clueless about such a simple thing as activating an internet account. I would gladly pay more for a much slower service if there was one around but Comcast/Xfinity seems to have the monopoly on this area in Jacksonville where I just moved to. What I learned is most people have such a difficult time with this company as well so something should be done about their poor service.", "Had the worse experience that I had with any company or anyone!!! Can't talk to anyone on the phone and when you do it does no good because they DO NOT do anything they say they will. Almost doubled my rate that they (supposedly) signed me up for. You have to take the equipment back to THEM as they say they will not pick it up. They can pick it up out of my dumpster if they want it - I will treat them like they treated me.\r\n\r\nI'm canceling this lousy, lying, two-faced, sorry excuse for a business and going to Triton. Comcast also lies to you about how many megabytes you need to have to order so as to attempt to drive folks toward the higher priced Mbps and Triton offers 8 Mbps (more than most any company needs) that they guarantee will do me better than Comcast's 105 Mbps @ over a 100 bucks where Triton charges 29.95 per month with a 50.00 one time installation and this is a month to month agreement rather than having to sign up to Comcast for much longer periods of time. SO I SAY COME AND GET YOUR CRAP EQUIPMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE HISTORY TO ME AND I HOPE ANYONE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS RIPOFF COMPANY!!!!!\r\n", "Comcast is horrible at customer service mostly because the people you always talk to are so far removed from you, usually India - they have no idea what we are dealing with over here. I will make a list problems I've had with them and they are apparently reoccurring to a sickening degree.\r\n\r\nThey always raise the price of my bill which I've read happens to people all the time, adding on ** extras that I never asked for. I have had to call and complain about this about 7 or 8 times in the last few years. The way they always try to resolve this is to give you a 'package deal' which only would result in me paying more money, another tactic that I found out is always used to scam customers. This way they make you think they are saving you money and giving you such a good deal.\r\n\r\nThey always say they will change something or adjust your bill and it might change for a month or two and then surprise, next month it's back up again. And no one is held accountable, if you ask them for their names they say, \"We are not allowed to divulge that information\" so you can never say this specific person promised me blah blah blah and make someone accountable. The only way to beat this I've read is to record all your calls with them and they also have I.D. Numbers so you have to ask them for their ID numbers. But you have to be religious about doing these things and keep track of every detail to use later. They transfer your calls like nobody's business, back and forth between departments so if you have a detailed problem you have to explain it thoroughly 5 times before someone can actually address your problem.\r\n\r\nThey also pretend like they can't change your bills themselves when in fact many of these people can. The last battle I had with them I got transferred 3 times when I was about to quit Comcast for good because a new company just moved into my area (Seattle) and I was telling them it's possible for me to pay less. Only then do they listen to you and this woman finally just clicked a button and changed my bill back to 49.95$ per month. And this was after I got a bill for 88.45$ for my monthly charge. And this woman was actually American - after talking to two foreigners they finally transferred me to someone local because they knew I was ready to quit and none of these workers likes to have that on their record because it looks bad on their quotas or how ever they do it.\r\n\r\nAnd finally after all this pretending like she went out of her way to work really hard to look for a deal she could offer me she promised me to change my bill back to 49 and some change when I check it the next day and it still shows up as 88.45$ that I owe so I am just about to call the map once again to complain. I broke my own rule when I forgot to ask for her ID number to keep her accountable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I am still constantly looking for a company that is willing to start offering a decent rate for internet service. Comcast is a horrible monopoly for the most part and it's only getting worse. They are buying up smaller companies that can't compete just swallowing them up one by one, like Charter and smaller local companies. Please everybody keep posting your bad reviews and spreading the word, they are just treating customers horribly because they can and we need to stop putting up with it.", "Comcast is the worse company.

A couple of days ago Comcast inexplicably disconnected my internet services. When I contacted customer support, I was initially transferred between multiple departments. Finally, one representative told me that there was service outage in my area, that technicians were working on the problem, and that I would be re-connected at 7:30pm that evening. This did not happen.\r\n\r\nConcerned because I had several papers due and needed the internet for research purposes, I contacted Comcast's customer services a second time. This time was told that my account had been deactivated and that in order to reactivate it, I would need to purchase wifi services ($39.99) and a self-installation kit ($9.95). I was told that I could either travel to a local service center or wait 3-5 business days for a kit to be mailed. I chose to wait for the kit to be mailed because I did not have time to travel to the service center.\r\n\r\nBecause I needed internet service to complete work for school, I ended up using my cellular hotspot for several days while waiting for the self-installation kit. Charges for the additional data totaled nearly $100. When I finally received the self-installation kit, I opened it to find two coaxial cables, a bag of cable tacks, and a splitter. Although I had been told that the kit would contain an activation code, there was no such code in the kit. I did not know what to do with the items I did receive so, once again, I contacted Comcast's customer support.\r\n\r\nThe first representative I spoke with was unable to help me and told me that my account was in \"inactive mode.\" He then transferred me to another department. The second Comcast representative I spoke with was also unable to help but told me that he had \"escalated my issue to upper management.\" He then transferred me to another department. Finally, the third representative I spoke with was able to reconnect my internet. At no point were any of the items in the self-installation kit used.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, no one bothered to mention that Comcast might have a wifi hotspot in my area that I could use while I was waiting to be reconnected. I only found out that this option was available after a friend mentioned it while I was chatting with the Comcast representative who was finally able to reconnect me. Obviously, by that time this was a moot point. This entire process was exhausting and completely uncoordinated. Each representative I spoke with asked me to list the same information and apparently Comcast kept no record kept of the issue because I also had to describe my problem each time. At no point was I given an explanation for why my service had been disconnected.\r\n", "I had two internet options available to me when I first moved here about 10 years ago; Qwest DSL and Comcast Cable. I had questions about both and so contacted both companies; I made my decision to go with Comcast based solely on one thing: it was easy to reach real people who spoke English with Comcast, while I never could figure out how to talk to a person at Qwest.\r\n\r\nEverything was fine for a few years, but then it started falling apart. My internet started disconnecting with increasing frequency, until it was happening several times an hour. I work two jobs from home, both of which require internet connection, so this was not only frustrating but also costly. I called customer service and they told me to get a new modem. I drove 100+ miles to the nearest Comcast store and got one. Problem solved... for about 9 months, when it started disconnecting several times an hour again.\r\n\r\nThis time I noticed something... the disconnecting was only happening in the daytime on hot, sunny days. Obviously some connection somewhere was expanding with the heat and messing up the connection, or something. The correlation was so strong that I could predict what days I would have connection issues by looking at the weather forecast. I called Comcast to report my findings in the hope they'd be able to really fix the issue, and this was when I discovered customer service no longer spoke English very well. But, I was able to get someone out who fixed some connection in the ground that was shorting out. Internet worked great... until next summer.\r\n\r\nSince then, for the last 5 or 6 years, every summer is a constant battle. I can go weeks without having a full day of continual connection. I can't make the customer service reps understand my problem.... they just tell me to \"unplug the modem for 15 seconds or to get a new modem.\" It is incredibly insulting to be sitting there on hold with your internet down while their stupid robot voice tells you to go online to check for outages. It's even more insulting when they try to get you to pay more for extra crap I don't want when what I already have doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI would switch to Qwest but my roommate has been battling with them for years too, though for different issues. The only other options around here are all dial-up (did you know they still even had dial-up?!) and that's just not good enough for my jobs. It's an incredibly frustrating situation and oh how I look forward to the day there is another option available... I'd even be willing to set aside my long-standing hatred of Google and try their service. It can't possibly be worse.", "This is my first time writing a review and I think it is important for people to know just how horrible Comcast is as a cable company. I hear the horror stories but never knew I would have one of my own. I relocated to a new condo over a month ago and requested for Comcast to disconnect and switch service to the new address. My online account never reflected the requested updated new address info and had a zero balance. I called and waited on customer service for 3 hours!!! Really? 3 hours??? When is this ever acceptable for any business! This is a shame and disgrace.\r\n\r\nI took several calls to find out my service was disconnect for $30. How can you make a payment on a $0 balance on your account. This company does not have the right to acquire Time Warner as a merge and the big monopoly of corporate should be limited so other competitors can be a part of the market. I know why people go to DirecTV... It makes sense now.", "I set up internet through Comcast when I moved to a new place. It didn't work for almost 2 weeks and when they finally sent someone, they charged me $39.95 for it and refused to remove it from my account. Even though I was told it would be free and even though it was their equipment outside that didn't work! I had to fight with them to get a credit for the couple weeks that it didn't work. Every time I've been on the phone with them and asked them to note my account, the rep leaves something totally different! Finally, today the customer service rep told me that \"I should have to pay for the technician because internet is luxury, not a utility\" and that it was my choice to have the service installed. I've had my fill with them once and for all. Switching to AT&T. They aren't much better, but hell I'm finding out anything is better than Comcast these days!", "Boy what a day. First, a Comcast guy shows up at our door and tells me he needs $223.00 or he is going to collect my modem. I explained to him that I owned the modem and he would not be taking it. I asked why he wanted $223 and he told me our bill had not been paid since October. Interesting, since we do direct payment through IU credit union. Bernice got online and transferred the data from IU to a note pad and we showed this to him. I also explained that we have two accounts in Bernice's name and if he would check, the excess money would be under that account and that Comcast had many times in the past, applied all of the payments to one account and then showed the other account past due.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't even look into it and told me our service would be disconnected. OK, so I took both bills to Comcast, waited in line to see the lady behind the counter, and finally after 30 minutes, got to talk to someone who I thought might get this corrected. I explained to her what was wrong and sure enough she checked and found an excess of $308 on the second account which is Bernice's sister's account that we also pay. So I said, \"there you have, just transfer that money over to the other account.\", \"I can\"t do that\". WHAT? She showed me a printout and told me I needed to show her which payments needed to be transferred. I told her I would need to be looking at our computer to be able to do that, and asked for her phone number so Bernice could call her. She told me she couldn't give me her phone number. So what do I do? Her response, \"I DON'T KNOW\".\r\n\r\nMy next comment was, \"I am paying you for a service, you have my money, your records even show that you have my money, and you can't transfer my money to the correct account, because Comcast applied it to the wrong account. Ma'am, do you understand that is theft of service, a criminal offense?\" Well she really didn't care, and she got huffy with me. This is what our country has come to, a big corporation makes a mistake and then refuse to correct it, and they just don't care about a customer who has paid their bill since 1999.", "I have had Xfinity/Comcast for years and have been pretty happy. A few weeks ago I noticed a channel had disappeared and so I called to find out why. The employee proceeded then to sell me more services since it wouldn't cost me too much more money than what I was paying. Well, the equipment arrived and when it wouldn't automatically work I contacted Xfinity again. This employee shared what this new stuff was going to cost me and so I cancelled.\r\n\r\nSo, a few hours later I had no cable and called again. This person got the cable working but unbeknownst to me he reset what I had just cancelled. So, I returned the equipment and saw my bill a day ago and contacted them again since the bill was over 200% what I had been paying. So, he helped me out but told me to call customer service to finalize everything. I did. But, instead of finalizing my cancellation he proceeded to try and sell me the same thing I had already cancelled twice. WTH is going on here?", "The quick version: Comcast sent my bill to an email address they created and that I didn't even know existed, then disconnected my service for non-payment without any attempt to notify me. Trying to contact them resulted in more than an hour of making phone calls, most of which were disconnected by their system before I ever got to speak to a human being. We'll be using a T-Mobile hotspot for our in-home Internet from now on.\r\n\r\nThe long version: We recently moved to the Atlanta area, and the only decent (price & speed) option for Internet service was Comcast/Xfinity. Having dealt with them before, we were less than pleased, but I work from home and decent speeds/data plans are important. So we bit the bullet and signed up. Here we are one month later, never received a bill, and wake up to find that our service has been disconnected for non-payment. We owe $70.90, says their website (the only site we can connect to using our WiFi). I, of course, want a breakdown of those charges and to see what the hell happened, so I try calling. That's when the real fun started.\r\n\r\nI tried several different 800 numbers that I found online (using my phone's hotspot to connect). Every single one of them had me enter all my identifying information multiple times, then disconnected me at the exact same point--before speaking to a human being, of course. I got a hold of a live chat operator (again, using my phone's data plan to connect) and got other numbers that were \"direct hotlines\" to the service and, eventually, the cancellation departments. They funneled me back to the same primary customer service lines where, again, I was disconnected.\r\n\r\nSo, let's call the sales lines--they always answer, right? Disconnected twice, but eventually managed to speak to several sales representatives who were \"sorry, but they can't transfer me\"--not to billing, not to cancellation. If I wanted to buy something more from Comcast they were happy to help, otherwise I was pretty much **.  After about an hour, I finally manage to get someone in cancellations. They tell me that my account is already in \"non-paid deactivation\" (remember, this is after one month of service, and I have NEVER RECEIVED A BILL) and they can't do anything. They can't even tell me what the $70.90 I supposedly owe them consists of; for that I need to speak to someone in billing.\r\n\r\nFinally get a hold of someone in billing (had to insist that the cancellation rep transfer me and stay on the line while I was being transferred to make sure I wasn't disconnected--she argued, but yelling at her for long enough actually worked). They tell me my bill was sent to @comcast.net account that they swear I set up but I very much did not, they simply took my Comcast username (which I had to set up) and made an email address without telling me, then sent my bill there. I insisted on a paper bill, and I was told that PAPER BILLS ARE AN EXTRA $5 CHARGE PER MONTH. Told him exactly what he could do with himself, and that was that.\r\n\r\nI'm typing this report using my phone's hotspot. I've already called T-Mobile, which has great service in this area and great customer service in general--we've been with them for more than a decade--and we'll be using a mobile hot spot with a high-tiered data plan for our in-home Internet. I'd rather pay a little (a VERY little) each month than give Comcast a single penny more.\r\n\r\nComcast: You suck. You know you suck, because reports like this are posted all the time. Maybe you disconnect everyone who calls because you're tired of hearing about how much you suck, but I'll be posting this everywhere I can just to make sure you know how much you suck. (p.s. you suck).\r\n", "Admittedly I have never had an issue with Comcast in the past, but today I spoke with several employees and didn't run into a problem until I asked for a tech to come out to my home and fix what were apparently unable to do in several hours of phone conversation and virtual \"tech support\". There is only so much of that you can do, if it's just not working. I'm a tech savvy person and I had reached the end of my patience for something that was supposed to be \"easy\". I was told the fee would be waived and I was being transferred.\r\n\r\nThat happened and all hell broke loose. This woman raised her voice, said she'd have to charge me, and that \"she does this all day long\". I asked for her manager and she said she'd \"transfer\" me. She hung up on me instead. I called back, he made me troubleshoot some more, then begrudgingly said a tech could come by Sat. . it's Wed. This is totally unacceptable. I can't wait until Google Fiber comes and breaks up this monopoly.\r\n", "First off, the fact that their product wasn't working properly was already a bad start and secondly, terrible customer service just ruined the whole mood. Here\u2019s what happened. My Internet was not working properly and when I had called the customer service, they were absolutely wonderful - treated me with respect and all. But here comes the bad part. They directed me to the Advanced Wireless Department and some whacko picks up the phone half-awake answering the phone with a very dreadful \"Hello?\" Very professional (Sarcasm). So I was telling him about what was happening with my Internet and halfway in, I hear the guy yawn and hang up the phone! The worst part about it is that this guy might be doing this to OTHER customers with no punishment whatsoever. Goes to show Comcast hires some very bad workers. Disappointed.", "I have been dealing with issues regarding my services since installation. Comcast tells you one thing without follow through, and outsources technicians that are unfamiliar with their product. They lack customer services, and charge you for services you are unable to get. They are extremely unprofessional and in my opinion the WORST cable provider.. In my opinion this company is a fraud that will waste your time and steal your money.", "I talked to a representative Feb 11th and asked her for Double Play (internet and TV). The rep started to tell me that they had great promotions. I told her my pay limits were up to $120 a month. She started saying that she was doing something special for me and that there was a plan with home security, telephone, internet and TV package and all in the price I was looking for; plus she said that she will waive installation fees, send me a $200 gist card and it was not a contract. At that point I said, \"Wow what a great deal.\"\r\n\r\nThe 19th of February the guys came in and installed the services and I they asked me to sign a contract, also my bill went from $119 to $185, then from $185 to $354 in just the first 2 weeks. That day my nightmare began. I called every single day since the 19th of February, people from customer services, customer solutions, billing all hung up on me and they did not care about anything at all. It was the worst experience ever. I tried, in every single call, explaining I got services I did not ask for and to listen to the call which has every single piece of the promises made by that sales rep that day (I gave them name, number, time of the call, length of the call). I had promises of managers and/or supervisors calling back and nothing ever happened. When day I called 10 times and the ten times I was hung up on. I never imagined Comcast was going to be so horrible. I returned all the equipment, no one cared.", "user CHRISTOPHER has entered room\r\n\r\nanalyst Frieda has entered room\r\n\r\nFrieda: Hello CHRISTOPHER_, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Frieda. Please give me one moment to review your information.\r\n\r\nFrieda: My pleasure to have you on this chat ! I will gladly assist you with your concern for today. Hope your doing well.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: My Issue: I became a customer of Comcast of April 21, 2015 and have experienced issues from day one. I tried to work with Comcast to make sure all my issues are resolved. Recently one of my tvs stop working and a technician was sent to my home.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: the technician stated that the signal coming to my home was bad and the wire would have to be replaced\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: he stated that technicians do not replace wires in the wall and that a comcast contractor would have to come.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: The contractor came to my home twice. 05/15/2015 and again 05/19/2015.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: my issue was resolved on the 05/19/2015 visit\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: so i decided to call in and ask why i was being charged if my services was not working for such a long period of time\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: I was told comcast has no record of my technical issues\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: this is very frustrating since i had such a huge issue and no one even seems to have a record of it.\r\n\r\nFrieda: I understand that you have tech issue that was resolved last 5/19/15 and you need credits for the affected date of the cable issue credited but there was no records of the tech issue.\r\n\r\nFrieda: Is that correct?\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: thats what i was told but i dont see how that would be possible. so many techs have been to my home since the start of may it has to be a record somewhere\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: I wish there was someone who could help me navigate through the many departments comcast has\r\n\r\nFrieda: My apologies this, Christopher. Let me look into your account so we can see what the problem is and check what needs to be done to get this credited for you.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: please do\r\n\r\nFrieda: If I cant do it on my end then I will get you to someone who can.\r\n\r\nFrieda: Please give me 2 to 3 minutes to pull up and check your account. Would that be okay?\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: thanks frieda\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: yes thats fine\r\n\r\nFrieda: Thanks\r\n\r\nFrieda: Thank you for waiting.\r\n\r\nFrieda: I have your account information pulled up.\r\n\r\nFrieda: Christopher, I have backdated the account. The first record that I have of the tech issue was last 5/11. THat was when the first tech visit was set.\r\n\r\nFrieda: The last note was on 5/15.\r\n\r\nFrieda: I can go ahead and credit you for 5/11-5/15.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: listen Frieda I need you to do more research in order to help me\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: I just got my problem resolved tuesday the 19th of May\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: this problem lasted so long a supervisor from the technical department got involved\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: his number is 302-661-4438 that is his comcast work phone\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: I want to resolve this issue but I dont understand why comcast has no record of my issues\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: Frieda how do i prove when my technical issue were resolved?\r\n\r\nFrieda: I apologize, Christopher, but as I am with the billing team, I can not access the actual tech issues in the account. I do not have the tools, I am dependent on the notes of the tech team.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: first Frieda please understand the technical issue I was having. The wire bringing service into my home from the Comcast source OUTSIDE was not carrying a strong enough signal according to the comcast tech. A contractor then was schedule to come to my home about 5 days later. Once the contractor came, five days later, he looked for a way to get a wire into my home but did not fix it\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i was very upset and called 1800comcast\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: the supervisor of the tech team then called me\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: if you cant navigate through the many departments what should i do\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: no one can see the tech side of the issue\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: that is very frustrating\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i have no one to call to get this fixed frieda\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: what should i do\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i wish i could do like a three way call with the billing department and the tech department\r\n\r\nFrieda: I understand Christopher but as I am with the biling team I cant see the the tech issue history of the account. In order for billing to process credits for you, if there is no contact notes then I must have authorization to credit the affected date coming from the tech team. They can just note the affected dates into the account notes. Once we have that billing can process credits for the authorized dates.\r\n\r\nFrieda: In order to get them to add the notes, the best way is to call them.\r\n\r\nFrieda: Please call Comcast service line at 1-800-934-6489.\r\n\r\nFrieda: Or better yet you can call Customers Solutions Department at 1-888-931-1379, during Assist hours: Monday - Friday: 8AM to 9PM & Saturday: 8AM to 1PM.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: so let me make sure i understand you correctly frieda.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i am a customer that has had serveral tech issues. comcast has no record of this problems. But if i dail a seperate 1800 number then someone from comcast can help me?\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: I wish there was someone who could help me navigate through the many departments comcast has\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: remember i stated that in the beginning of our chat\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: so instead of someone from comcast calling over to the department you want the frustrated customer to do so.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i even gave you supervisors number to try to fix this\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: its going to take some effort from you Frieda\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: why should i call this number instead of you?\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i would have to call- them then call you back. So i have to contact Comcast three times to resolve one issue\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: call once for you to tell me to call the other number. Call the other number for them to add some notes that only comcast employees can see. Then call you back and ask if the other department has done their job\r\n\r\nFrieda: Christopher as much I would like to assist you by calling them on your behalf, I am a chat agent I do not have the option to call-out.\r\n\r\nFrieda: The billing team, in terms of tech issues is dependent on the notes posted by the tech team as I do not have the tools that can pull up your actual technical issue records, only the tech team have that which is why I got you the number for them.\r\n\r\nFrieda: Once they have pulled up the actual technical history of the account, all they have to do is note the dates which have the issue in question and then billing can credit it. It is farely straight forward once the correct department is reached.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: So once again Frieda there is nothing you can do to help me with this issue other than refer me to someone else?\r\n\r\nFrieda: For now with the records that I have what I can do is credit the 5/11-5/15 for the tech issue.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: At this point I would like to say thank you for your help. My issue is still unresolved but i understand the many steps i have to take to fix my issue.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: the credit your are offering is not acceptable because my service was interrupted longer.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i appreciate the offer.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: i may cancel my service because of this issue\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER: have a good day", "I tried Comcast under the 30 day free trial. The service did work well! But for other reasons I cancelled the account within the 30 day period. Their technician came out to take back the equipment - so far so good. But they kept billing me, and now have turned the 'free, no obligation, nothing owed' bill over to a collection agency. I have had no less than 3 people at Comcast who all assured me that they can and will fix this problem, but I continue to get calls. The collection agency tells me that I owe Comcast money, Comcast tells me I don't owe anything. It just shouldn't be this hard. They obviously still do not care about customer service - how hard can it be to fix this problem???", "The Internet and cable services are down since Friday, and all we hear is promises. They are lying to our faces, promising they will come since this morning. Since this morning, we talked to at least 6 different people and they pretend they never received a phone call. Every time you call, they say they do not know what we are talking about. We have saved all the confirmation numbers that could verify the basic facts of our claim.", "I've had Comcast for almost 2 years due to there not being any other options in my area. I haven't had major problems aside from random charges and increases on my bill. For the past month and a half, however, my internet stopped working completely. We had the basic Internet package of 25 Mbps. I would call every few days and they would \"reset the connection\", only for it to work for a few hours then stop again. They had no open appointments for almost 2 weeks for a tech to come out.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally did, he spent an hour working on our modem but only changed out a cord. I ran an Internet speed test through both the Comcast and Geek Squad sites (which took forever to load) before he left and both told me the Internet speed was about 5 Mbps. I asked the tech to check out the modem again and he finally got it to 12 Mbps but only when the Ethernet cord was plugged in. He told me, verbatim, \"You aren't ever guaranteed wifi, only Internet when you have the Ethernet cord plugged in.\" REALLY?\r\n\r\nMy roommate has a MacBook air which doesn't even have an Ethernet outlet. He basically said that was the best he could do and left. The Internet worked for about 2 days and then stopped again. I called back only to be on the phone for an hour and a half, transferred 7 times (because no one could figure out what was wrong), and then was told, \"The Internet appears to be working properly from our end but we could send a tech out for $70 to take a look at it\". I continually asked to be transferred to a rep in the US because I couldn't understand what they were saying and kept trying to get me to upgrade to an Internet bundle with home phone service. Who even has a home phone anymore? \r\n\r\nI was only connected to a U.S. rep when I told them I wanted to cancel my service, which I did. I also was told I wouldn't pay for the Internet for the time it was out which they had documented due to my numerous calls, but guess what? My bill doesn't reflect any type of price adjustment. I will NEVER use this excuse for a company again and would rather flush my money down the toilet than pay for their non-working crap. It's a shame they can get away with treating customers the way they do.", "The internet I pay for is awful. I pay a premium for what should be a premium service (blast internet speeds -- 50 Mbps), and don't receive anything close to acceptable. Comcast internet is an absolute scam.", "My wife spent three hours on the phone for them to fix our internet. It took them 3 hours to figure out we are on the slow internet service. Now the internet cuts out, wifi doesn't work. Technician came out and put a new cable on the ground, everything was working, now the internet cuts out again. My wife waited all day on Saturday for the technician to come out. When the technician replace the cable, he said everything was okay. I am NOT happy with Comcast and will change over when a better service shows up.", "Trying to contact Comcast (again!) about invoice questions as well as equipment failure. As usual I get the automated run-around and hang-up after punching in phone number and zip code repeatedly while stuck in an endless loop taking me back to the main menu... until I get cut off. This pathetic company deserves a flaming pitchfork, not a star! (After writing this scathing review I can expect a saccharine email assuring me that they want to make it all right. I'm waiting, Comcast....)", "I've had Comcast internet, TV and phone service for almost 3 years. I purchased my own modem from Best Buy (I have receipt and box spent $189) so I didn't have to rent from Comcast for $7-$10 a month. About 3 months after the start of service I received my first letter stating during a review of my account they have noticed I am not paying the modem rental. I called and stated it was my modem and so therefore I did not need to pay them. Oh yes they said sorry about that and removed the charges. Now every 2 months since this first letter I get another letter stating the same thing!! I've called approximately 20 times to correct this problem. \r\n\r\nI've given them the receipt, and personally gone into the office (and talked to the employees making minimum wage and unable to do anything about my issue). No one seems to know what is going on or why I'm constantly being charged for my own equipment!! One employee has made a \"ticket\" which was supposed to go to a higher employee and they would contact me. This never happened!! I could go on with the other issues we have had such as our sudden extremely large increase in broadband usage when nothing changed in our house! Supposedly we went from using 21GB a month to over 300GB! Really? The only thing we did was supposedly upgrade our service so the only difference is on the Comcast end!! I was previously in another state with Suddenlink and boy do I wish we were still in their area! Comcast is absolutely the worst company I have ever used!! If I could give them zero stars I would!!\r\n", "Comcast is the worst company I have had the opportunity to deal with. I have called to disconnect my account with them several times over the past few months and still charged me for services I didn't use. I have had dishNET since December but Comcast charged me until February! It's Crap and that company should be brought down for fraud!", "Service was disconnected for nonpayment. Death in the family caused unexpected financial problems. 2 weeks later, a rep left a note to get the equipment! I plan to pay the bill in july... this is June. Called and waited 1 hr. No answer.

They have charged me for the 1st 2 techs last year \"which they did not fix problem\", charged me for mailing me new cable boxes but when the techs showed up said I didn't need them and took the boxes with them. I've had promises and rudeness when I call in\" which is at least 2 to 3 times a month begging for help with these issues\". If you think about this- it\u2019s theft and false advertisement...Not getting what I paid for and horrible service. This does not even include issues with the cable tv.", "If anyone thinks that Comcast is not aware of what they are doing, they are deluding themselves. Utter genius to create a monopoly selling a product that does not work, in fact, gets progressively worse, then sell \"upgrades\" to improve service (which do not work either). This is exactly why net neutrality is so vital. These corporate criminals will not react to any of our consumer pleas so long as they can extort profits from us for peddling garbage, unchecked and unregulated.", "Hmm, let's see where to begin.... Their speeds are not accurate no matter where you live. I've had the misfortune of living in two areas where they own a monopoly and it was never the speed they sold you. You are INCREDIBLY lucky if you can get through to talk to someone without them or the automated system hanging up on you. \r\n\r\nMy BIGGEST complaint is how they will pad the bill and not tell you. Just don't take the story I'm about to tell you. Read all the others posted here on this forum. Somehow when I upgraded my service last year & bought myself a new modem (from Best Buy) for the DOCSIS 3.0 upgrade, the billing team decided to put down I was renting the DARN thing.... I didn't notice till one year later and all I got was a sorry and $20 credit. If they didn't have a monopoly in my current region, I would definitely change in a flash.", "Well I call customer service 2 days ago asking why my internet is very slow. They said \"you have the basic.\" I said \"OK but I'm customer. I'm not so happy what I can do.\" The guy said \"I can give 2 pks for 54.99, include t.v and internet.\" I said \"I don't need the t.v.\" He said \"is the only way\". I said \"really\". I'm very disappointed why service is bad. But when I said no he said \"let transfer with others peoples\". I said OK but I was in the line 15 mins waiting. No one help me. After that somebody disconnected my call. Not good at all. I'm looking for different company.", "Back in December 2014 I cancelled my account with Comcast due to the fact that the internet was not 50 mb that they claim it to be, it was more like 10 mb on a good day. So sent my equipment back to the local store, dealt with a very rude customer service rep. Was told that i would receive a final bill within 60 days. Well long story short, was never sent a bill from Comcast, which in turned sent my bill to some collection agency. I then called the collection agency to find what was going on. So at that time i filed a BBB complaint. \r\n\r\nGot a call from someone claiming to be from the Executive Office of Comcast. Boy let me tell you, that employee represented the company at its finest. Rude, No help, even more rude, had a attitude like i was wasting her time and offer no solution.. Told the young lady that I wanted to speak to someone higher up and had to explain to this fun employee that she wasn't the top of comcast and that I wanted to speak to someone higher. She put in the 24 hr request so we will see what happens.", "This complaint is based on my current Comcast service. 3-4 days out of 30 my service is out. I am currently a full time student and I require the internet to complete assignments, and this is of no concern to Comcast. I have had slow internet, cable channels that are forever pixelating, they send a technician that never fixes anything. This service is expensive and horrible.", "My medical office had Comcast business internet for several years. A year ago, I retired and closed the office when I turned 75. I moved the fast service to my home. I am now moving out of state so I requested the service be shut off. Comcast said when the service was moved, a new contract started and I have to pay a $2,300 early termination fee. In the contract, they were giving me a $10 discount from $109 to $99 monthly which explains the termination fee. A company engaging in a shameless grift. Truly pathetic. Elizabeth Warren is right. Big Corporations lie and cheat people and think nobody will stop them. Have they no shame?", "My home wifi was not working all of a sudden on April 13 and I contacted Comcast online to attempt to have it fixed. A woman named ** was working with me and told me I wasn't receiving a signal and would need to plug my modem into my PC. I explained I did not have a PC, only a smartphone and a laptop. She gave me a telephone number to call for help. When calling the number, it was answered as a \"non-working number for Comcast\". I went back to her and told her this and she gave me two more phone numbers, one which went to Verizon and another which also went to a \"non-working number for Comcast\". I double checked these numbers for accuracy against what she had typed to me. I promptly told this was absolutely pathetic. I got offline and called Comcast, only to be told that my equipment wasn't registered, which is nonsense, as it has been in use for over two years and had worked the previous day. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a signal was present only to not work. I called Comcast again and spoke with **, who was very nice but it took some fiery language on my part to him in admonishing Comcast for the incompetence and negligence I had been subjected to for no reason. I told him I wanted to know why my internet was down and what needed to be done to fix it and I didn't want to hear another word out of him except for answers to those questions. After several minutes of back and forth and my basically telling him to get an answer for me this minute, he came back to tell me my Comcast modem is apparently now \"old equipment\" and must be exchanged. I found this ridiculous, especially given the fact that the previous two people at Comcast never mentioned this! How does this happen? The modem worked on April 13 and all of a sudden on April 14 it does not. \r\n\r\nNo notice is sent from Comcast regarding any required equipment changes, it just happens and you are out of luck but still have to pay them? When are the powers that be going to wake up to their scams? ** told me to disconnect the modem and take it to Comcast to be exchanged.

Comcast charged $70 for a technical call and refused to reverse the charge until I called to cancel the service.", "Having slow internet connections since last few days, have results from speedtest.

The tech showed up was incompetent and said that someone would be out Monday to fix the problem. The tech showed up Monday called the wrong phone number when he arrived BUT was given the correct number to call. HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO CALL THAT NUMBER HE JUST LEFT. When she called Comcast they said someone would be there Friday a whole week after it was supposed to be done. After 6 hours on the phone with this poor excuse for a company speaking to at least 8 different minions, she was promised someone would be there the next day (Tuesday) at 3 pm. 3 pm came and went. Again she called they told her someone be there Monday the 8th of June. What happened to 3 pm or even Friday. \r\n\r\nAgain several phone calls to Comcast with no resolution.

The representative I talked with told me that there is no moving requests in their system. When I asked why I have a confirmation number the answer was \"I don't know\". He wanted me to make another moving request online. I did and it gives me June 10th for the re-connection date! Is this some kind of joke? \r\n\r\nNow I have to wait 6 more days without internet? And Comcast going to charge me 60 dollars for the month of June when I don't have the service for one third of the month just because they can't move my service to a different unit in the same building?

I was about to go with Verizon for my business with one phone line and internet they were offering me 112$ month to month. Just called to ask the price from Comcast the guy there told me that taxes in Verizon are high and Comcast is the best. I have signed my lease for business which I closed for a year but Comcast without telling me signed me up for 3 years. The person on the phone never told me that I am going to have Comcast in next 3 years even though I had my lease for one year. I called to customer service to cancel it and found out that I am stuck with them and the worst part is they don't let me go out of contract without signing the paper that I am going to pay them 75% of left contract. \r\n\r\nI have taken Contracts law and never saw similar type of contract when one party tries to go out of contract he can not. This is my civil right to break the contract. and by contract law the damage I caused I might be paying but in this case the damage for Comcast will be 120$ 10 $ a month discount that they gave me. So instead of paying 120$ more a year they now inducing me to pay 75 %, ridiculous. I have contacted to Comcast several times , asked the supervisor they told me they are going to call me and I have never received a call. Last time when I talked to representative in Comcast I asked her to give me in writing that somebody is going to call me but I have never heard anything. Comcast thinks That I am going to pay them, No I will wait till you take me to court where you will definitely loose.", "Basically I was the victim of a bait-and-switch by the XFINITY store at Delk and Powers Ferry during purchase of the XFINITY home security system. I was told verbally during the presentation that it would be cancelled without fee if I moved outside Comcast area. No contract was presented until installation. It was signed for me without my being present. A year later I had to move and was charged a large and exorbitant termination fee. Customer service has been non-existent as I have been lied to, hung up on and kept waiting numerous times without any of the under-trained reps able to even understand the problem, much less assist. Also numerous promises to return my calls were not kept. I will not ever deal with Comcast again and neither should you. Worst experience ever with any company. System is not worth the hassle.", "I canceled Comcast Internet service when I was moving to a new state. I received two bills after I canceled service, the last one coming 5 weeks after service was canceled. I called Comcast to ensure that it was my final bill and the Comcast rep ensured me that it indeed was my final bill. I paid that amount and thought I was done with Comcast.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later I get a letter from a collection agency stating that I owe Comcast $73 and that I must pay $157 to the agency. I never received any bill or correspondence from Comcast and when I called to talk to them, Comcast stated that I had a credit of $85. The $ doesn't really bother me, but I am in escrow on a house and this account has knocked my credit score down over 100 points and will significantly affect my mortgage rate. I had nearly an 800 credit score and this thing has knocked me down to the 660's. I'm working to get it all straightened out, but it may not get worked out in time for my closing, if at all.\r\n\r\nComcast Internet wasn't any good in the first place, but this ordeal has been a real thorn in my side for weeks now. It has been echoed on this site often, Comcast has a monopoly and truly does not care about service or what kind of damage they do caused by their clueless reps. If you research Comcast and still go with them, I've got no sympathy for you. It's better to go without than have to deal with them. \r\n", "We have had little choice in our internet provider since we moved into our home. Sadly the only carrier is Comcast. Do not waste your money. We have been calling everyday since we got the service for sub par performance. For the amount we pay, we are supposed to receive UP TO 50 Mbps. We are lucky if we ever get 10. Currently as I write this, I am on hold waiting for a Comcast supervise again, and we getting a raging 0 Mbps and 0 upload while managing to somehow be on the net. \r\n\r\nLast week, we lost service for 3 days, no refund offered, we had someone \"working on the problem\" in our neighborhood. It magically worked for the weekend. The same time they were working on it out in front of my house, we had a tech come into our home and check out our connection, check the lines that were just installed, and everything is FINE. It's Comcast not providing what people are paying for. I am tired of fighting them, but what can I do? It's all our new neighborhood offers. If you plan on buying or building a house, reconsider if the only cable company in your neighborhood is Comcast. It's not worth the hassle.", "Since I have had Comcast, I have hated this company. Prices are ridiculous and speeds are not as promised. They use speed throttling to fool speed tests, but actual internet speeds are not close to what was promised or what speed tests show them to be. My internet constantly goes out/down, wi-fi only works part of the time, prices keep going up constantly, and they get away with all of it because there is no other competition in this area. I created this account just to leave this review and was not surprised to see that there were hundreds more like me on this site. As soon as I find any other high speed provider, Comcast will never see or hear from me again.", "On June 6, 2015 I called Comcast customer service for help with internet service. At the end of the call, the CSR who gave her name as **, gave me a sales pitch. ** told me I get increase my internet speed for only $7.00 per month, and it was a 30 day trial period during which time I could cancel at any time and not be charged. I asked ** at least five times if it was only $7.00 per month and that I could cancel at any time and not be charged. She said yes. I was also told I would not be charged the $7.00 until the end of the 30 day trial period. I said OK.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2015 I went online to look at my Comcast internet data usage for the month, and found that my bill had increased by $17.00. I called Comcast customer service - billing - and spoke to **. ** told me part of my increased bill was due to Comcast price increases that go into effect on July 1, 2015. ** told me that $11.42 would be removed from my bill and that she has no idea why ** told me a $7.00 price. I told ** I wanted to go back to the exact service I had. ** assured me she would take care of it.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 2015 I went online and Comcast still had not corrected my bill. I called Comcast billing yet again, and spoke to **. ** said it was in the system to remove $11.42 from my bill, and ** assured me it would be taken care of. On June 30, 2015 my bill still has not been resolved. My bill has never been paid late. My bill is due tomorrow. How can any company be so incompetent? I really don't think they care. I am getting ready to switch to DIRECTV for TV, and AT&T for internet service.", "I recently purchased Comcast in August of 2014. On March 11, 2014 my Comcast went down. After an hour of troubleshooting they explained that a technician would have to come to my house the following Wednesday. I told them that was unacceptable that I needed a security system. Comcast repeatedly lied about having someone come out sooner and after several days of I trying to cancel the service they told me although the error was Comcast fault I still would have to pay an early termination fee and still have to wait until a technician to come to my home. I have been hung up on twice, not able to get a direct number for the home security department since that is not option on the phone, lied by a customer service agent telling me that the phone doesn't work and putting in escalation tickets that aren't true.", "I had internet through Comcast and was fairly happy with it. However my roommate was interested in trying out TV through them as well. In February, we upgraded our service and ordered the self-install kit. It took almost 2 weeks to get to our residence, they did not even ship it until exactly 7 days after the initial order date. When we received the equipment, the HDMI ports were literally covered up with a sticker and service reps on the phone refused to believe that this could be possible. Finally, they sent out a technician who saw our boxes, was baffled, and explained they must have been faulty. He was very nice and got us new equipment from his truck. \r\n\r\nThe TV was finally working however we were unhappy with the service. Assuming (apparently wrongly) that I was still covered under the money-back guarantee, I call Comcast to downgrade my service back to the internet and after we finally get it worked out. The service rep. says \"oh by the way, you're not covered\" because the change was made to the account 31 days ago. Here's my problem, not only are we being charged for the shipment of the faulty boxes ($9.95), they are also charging us for the technician visit ($39.95) which was only necessary because they sent us faulty equipment! Now, I find out that even though our service didn't get set up until 14 days ago, we have to cover the entirety of what is now a $168 bill.\r\n", "The only reason I am giving Comcast a one star review is because I don't have the option of giving them none. We have been customers for 17 years. In recent years, we have experienced enormous problems with our service. Just like the previous reviewer, we were roped into the Triple Play package and blatantly lied to about what it consisted of. Our home phone never worked, cable was going out routinely, and internet would go down. We finally eliminated the phone \"service\" and were charged out the yin yang for doing so. We kept the cable and internet. \r\n\r\nOne day I went to log onto my email and it told me the password was incorrect. I knew it wasn't, but when I tried to change it and it asked for my secret question, it wouldn't accept the answer that I know was correct. I spent a grand total of SIX hours, for three days straight, on the phone with Comcast customer \"service\". Every time they would reset the account and I would create new passwords, it would lock me out again the next day. After getting four different customer service reps on the line, I finally got one who transferred me to a supervisor. He immediately got on the phone and told me that he couldn't help me change my password because I was not an \"authorized\" user. Not an authorized user? The account is in my husband's name with me listed as an authorized user and has been for 17 years. He uses AOL email. \r\n\r\nI gave them all identifying information, to include social security numbers and he still wouldn't assist me. As a result, I was unable to access email and had to deal with angry customers because I was unable to respond to them. Can you say furious? My husband was so livid, he called them back and, of course, they showed me as an authorized user. We dumped Comcast within 48 hours. You can't understand half of what the customer service reps say, they don't know what they're doing, and equally as important, their services are completely unreliable. \r\n\r\nShame on these incompetent bozos! They lost customers of almost two decades that paid in excess of $300 for services. Joke of a company. I do mean joke. Don't waste your time or hard earned dollars. Go with a provider that knows how to hire, train, and run a company. Horrible organization.", "The second month of a new account was double billed. I have called over 15 times and spent 20+ hours on the phone trying to get someone at customer service to correct the billing. If I'm lucky enough to get someone on the phone that can even pull up my account, they say they've never seen this before and need to submit it to billing for an investigation. Then, I never hear from anyone regarding the mistake. My account is now set to disconnect for the 3rd time. The double billing is their mistake, but I get to pay for it in wasted time and frustration.", "Internet Service Intermittent Outages Daily Dec 2014 - April 2015 - I have called Comcast customer service several times a week for the last 4 months because of outages and I get the runaround.

No one knows what is going on to resolve this issue so at this point I have to look at alternatives like AT&T or cellular.", "I ordered Blast internet, yet that professional grade of internet never worked in our home. We had three techs agree that it wasn't working and never follow through with fixing it. I called to troubleshoot multiple times and told that it was working even though speed tests proved otherwise. My complaints were never noted and so I could not get money back for the non-existent service. Furthermore, it took me 1 hour and 46 minutes to cancel my cable because, shockingly, the man on the phone could not figure out how to do it. Instead he kept saying, \"Please, I got you a great new deal. Just sign up for this because the cancellation is not working\".", "Comcast had gotten good reviews from our friends. So we gave it a try. The wifi worked well for a few months. With 3 iphone and 2 laptops using it, it did pretty well. After about 5 months it slowed way down.

I wish I had known that before hand.", "Well first off let me say that I thought this company was a scam at first. You see they run it like a Ponzi scheme. If you meet an older Caucasian guy ** with a business opportunity, STAY CLEAR. The recruit new hires from backpage.com or craigslist. I haven't seen any post on carreerbuilder.com or any other job board. Once you are hired, they boast that you can make over 100,000 per year. If they see you doing good, they will ask you to recruit ex-coworkers, relative and friend and offer a referral bonus. They offer commission on weekly basis. If enrolled in direct deposit then Monday will be payroll. An administration fee of $25 will be deducted from each payroll. \r\n\r\nBecause they are a sales orientation business, 10% hold back of commission are reserved in a account just in case of cancelled sales, bad sales or chargeback (chargeback is when a Comcast customers get installed, they decide to change their mind and cancel their subscription). When you make a sale, especially when you make multiple sales, they offer cash bonuses from $25 - $200 per commission. Just in case you have a slow week, you can ask for a paycheck advance, and then they will deduct it from your next paycheck. Once you have enough time in the company, they will offer to help pay a few of your bills or even offer help with housing. They are clear about that the workers are independent contractors. They don't even offer any kind of benefits or pathway to become employees. They will offer to move you to another region after enough time in the company.\r\n\r\nBUT HERE IS THE REAL DEAL: I got recruited by the brother of the owner of the company **. I made about 55,000 each year I was there, that includes bonuses. The direct deposit dates fluctuated. Sometimes it was Friday, or Saturday or even as late as Tuesday. They blamed it on Comcast saying that did the invoice late. Every month there was at least 1 or 2 sales missing. Plus they charged $35 administration fee. When I left the company in late March 2014 and came in April 2014, they reduced my holdback percentage from 20% to 10%. Many time sometimes on a weekly basis, I had to argue and escalate when they did not pay me on bonuses. Some bonuses it took them 4 months from the time I made the sale. At times I did need a advance partly because I was missing sales every month sometimes almost every week. They charged me $25 to advance my own money.\r\n\r\nThey did offer to pay some of my rent and some bills, but that would only put me further in debt. We were independent contractors, I worked 50-60 hrs. per week, just to make close to $1000. In my slow weeks I still worked 40 hrs. and took only 500 per week in commission. They did not offer any kind of permanent position within the company, yet they wanted me to become a manager. I realized that once they had more than 50 workers, they decided to get rid of plenty of people. Yet at that time they did not offer any kind of medical, dental, vision, or retirement plans. I did take a job transfer to Tallahassee, FL. That was a bad move, their commission was less, the sales harder to make. I did not have a social life. And my supervisor offered to fire me. Any worker that took a job transfer to Florida resigned while working there.", "This is the first time writing a review about any company. I was having issues with connecting to my internet and had to call 5 time before giving up. 3 of their reps hung up on me and the other two transfer me to other department. I hate Comcast!!", "I went into the local Comcast store and wanted to cancel my service because my health has deteriorated in the last couple years. Upon dealing with 3 different people, I was then directed to the person at the last stop to wring me out on why not to cancel my service with them. I explained I have been placed on a limited income due to my health, and could not afford the service at the price I had been paying. The young lady said, \"Oh I will get you fixed up and you can have better, faster service at a better price.\" \"What? Really? Ok, are you sure?\" \"Yes, and it will not ever go up!\"\r\n\r\nThree months later I pull a letter out of the mailbox that says, we are so sorry, we have made a mistake and the price will now be 10.00 more a month starting next month. We did not charge you for the modem. So, I called and explained the arrangement of my monthly payment and was told after climbing up the \"chain\" of professional bargainers that we are truly sorry, but you have to pay the 10.00 because of our error. I believe the large civil lawsuit that was filed against Comcast in Philadelphia that states Comcast will pay out $16.67 million in cash for overcharging customers, should have been an idea to let's do things right the first time. Guess they didn't learn a thing? \r\n\r\nPlease Comcast, don't tell me that you're sorry, and can't do a thing about it and that I can pay or change my service. I paid you an installation fee and 3 months of service for which I was promised a faster speed internet of 50 mgb not the 12 I was getting. I can't even get my apps to download and play without interference every single time. I wish that large billion dollar corporations would just stop the bargains and give me a set price. If I can't afford it, I will go someplace else. Don't candy coat the deal and then say, aww, oops, sorry. How many others got this letter here in Albuquerque, NM hmmm? Stop playing games with your customers. It's wrong and illegal, remember? Very Angry.", "In the beginning...There was installation. I was quoted one price and charged $40 more. This was mitigated by the installer being 4 hours late and being credited $20 against the $40 they overcharged me.

So (even after past miserable experiences) to go with the free stuff...who wouldn't! So I got it installed (as described above). I will say that the internet and wireless access has been flawless for two months (color me shocked!). But this DVR is crap! It's slow, laggy, and the controls are counter-intuitive. When something doesn't work as expected and you keep pressing the \"OK\" button (because of the God awful lag), it deletes your program! I'd kill to have my DirecTV DVR back. It worked exactly as you expect. Comcast has obviously cut too many corners on hardware.\r\n", "So I received a call this morning from Comcast stating that I was at 90% on my data usage(??). I have never received any information stating that I would begin to get charged for using internet; I thought that was included in my 2 year agreement.

It took me 6 different people to finally talk to someone who was able to give me a fair and cheap price for my service.

As an owner of residential properties in South Florida, I have cause to subscribe to the internet for seasonal tenants. Comcast is not set up for this. What surprises me is that with as many rental property's that are in South Florida, you would think that they deal with situations such as this where there's policy and procedures. They can't get it right the first time ever. \r\n\r\nLast year I attempted to pay for the complete service in advance, and have the service turned off automatically. They can't do this. When you live in another city and attempt to resolve issues for your own account, they need your account number. There's no way to get it. Unless you have the account # you can't help yourself, and if you are not in S. Florida, you can't just pop into one of their offices and help yourself. It took me between 25 and 30 telephone hours last year only to wind up with a second account when the dust settled and I had to start over. \r\n\r\nThis year, armed with the account number I attempted to pay over the telephone, and they got it wrong again. The details are too arduous to list here. I attempted to pay my tenants internet bill on the telephone and after asking the total amount owed for the entire length of the stay, they still got it wrong. It only took 56 minutes this time to get to a resolution, (We'll see) but I needed to acquiesce to paying a reinstallation of my TV service just to save having to get onto another department. This, even though I pay for the TV as part of my HOA maintenance fee. They never should have turned off my TV in the first place! I've never been late with my condo maintenance!! In the case of my internet commitment, I attempted to pay in full 3 days after I asked to have it shut down (BTW, they didn't do that either) and they were still billing me for the subsequent month of April!\r\n\r\nI thought all that I went through was possibly because I'm an imbecile, but last month at a gathering of 30 people up in Sebastian, FL, someone brought up the topic of the ineptitude of Comcast, and all hell broke loose. Everyone in attendance was attempting to top the prior complaining attendee with yet another tale of woe from their own past Comcast experiences. This actually made me feel better as it's an indication that Comcast is actually poorly run and it wasn't me!\r\n\r\nSo, without other recourse in dealing with this monopoly, I can only attempt to warn others.

I started with Comcast in May 2014. It started out ok. But then the internet would go off and then I would have to call them to see what was going on. Every time I called I would get a phone call after a week or so and the message would say \"you requested service. If you don't call us back we'll assume you still need the service.\" What in the world? I would desperately call back knowing that a service request meant extra charge. I would call and ask \"What is going on? When did I request this service?\" Another time I was moving to a new apartment. I called to request a transfer of the same service with no changes to my new apartment. A lady told me \"yes, yes it will stay intact and the same service will be transferred\".. What a liar! \r\n\r\nThe first month I get a charge that was supposed to be $85 including taxes was $172. I called after opening my bill and the rep tells me. \"oh, yes ma'am, you requested A New Service and therefore you have a new account number\"! Upset I hung up the phone, called back. The new rep told me that I didn't request the new service, which that was accurate, \"but the reason you are charged that amount\" he said \"was because when you move, the account changes\"? I told him that before moving to the new apartment I called to make sure that the service would stay the same. He said, \"oh no, it never stays the same when a customer moves to another area.\" At that point I was so angry. I didn't want anything to do with this company. \r\n\r\nI spoke to the manager of the condo I'm renting and she said that Comcast is the only internet and cable service available in the units. :( I was so disappointed, I spoke to the Comcast supervisor requesting a service removal for good. He gave me a better price and \"removed\" the mistake, but then again after a month I get another bill for the amount $172. I called back again, the rep would tell me \"it's solved now\". After a month same thing for the amount $162 now. The supervisor again gave me a promotion to have me stay with them and not to remove the service. He said that there was no record of my payments!! Unbelievable! I honestly hope this company goes bankrupt like GM did. I will be so happy when this happens. \r\n\r\nToday I called again because I got a phone called about 45 minutes ago from a Comcast rep telling me another lie. She said on the message \"hello miss, we have scheduled a technician go see the problem, and if you Don't call us back, we'll assume you still need a technician\". I never requested anyone to come to my home. So I immediately on a Saturday at 8pm when I got this untasteful message, called back and the lady rep tells me, \"Yes, you have a technician scheduled for Monday at 1pm\". First of all that was a lie, and second I would never request anyone on a Monday and much less at 1pm.\r\n\r\nI honestly need someone to look over the company. Someone has to put a stop to this. This should not be happening in America. Corruption is present in this Comcast company and should be banned. Time Warner Cable has been the best so far, but it's the North. I guess in the South there's always more corruption. Thank you for reading my complaint.

I was furious. I have been calling a specific employee at Corporate (15 times) and can never get through. I have asked her to email me an answer: I agreed to pay the $144 plus $68 from past account and asked for an answer. I have received no specific response to that request. I am furious, will NOT pay $287 NOR will I pay $218 a month. I have threatened to cancel my service and have contacted DirecTV. I prefer to keep Comcast, but not at that price.", "WARNING: Under no circumstances should you consider Xfinity Home Security. We recently installed Xfinity Home Security in our home in San Francisco. The Comcast representative knew we would be moving soon to Pittsburgh PA and assured us that we could transfer our service. Nothing could be further from the truth. We had to battle for weeks to get the service transferred and we had a horrible battle over an early termination fee. Comcast incorrectly billed us twice for installation and we spent days and days on the phone with call center people who could not correct the problem. In the meantime, we needed to disconnect the system for 4 to 6 months while we renovated our home. Comcast refused to discontinue the billing while we had the system shut down. Keep in mind we are paying our Comcast bill at our other address in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nAfter a two-month battle with Comcast, we gave up and returned our Comcast equipment. Comcast told us we needed to return the additional motion detectors we had paid for. We received no refund for the equipment that we had purchased. Several weeks later, we get a call from Comcast Customer Solutions now saying they would consider allowing us a six-month billing delay while we renovated. We asked them how could we ever get our bill corrected? They didn't know. We asked them if we would now be charged for a third installation fee? They did not know. We asked them if we were going to have to buy the additional motion detectors again? They did not know. We respectfully asked them to forgive the early termination fee and they said THEY WOULD PURSUE US FOR THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, I am paying a monthly fee for Comcast services at my current address. I asked ** if the several hundred dollar early termination fee was worth losing a customer who will be paying Comcast for another 20 or 30 years and he said the early termination fee was more important. We have been a Comcast customer for over 25 years and we are winding down ALL of our services with Comcast. On a scale of 0 to 10, there is not a number low enough to rate Comcast.\r\n\r\n", "We moved in here 4 months back. First our modem was connected to someone else address for more than a month and it took them nearly 1 month to fix it and send someone. Then it continuously goes off 20 times during in a day. As a consumer we don't have a choice as Optimum is not a provider here, only Comcast. Why is monopoly allowed?\r\n\r\nWe had Optimum previously in our other previous town and they are the best. They will be there to fix anything within an hour even during Sunday. When there was no power they put a battery to make the Internet work. Now that is what I call service. Comcast really don't care as they know you do not have much choice except get internet from them. I am not sure what the councilors and Mayors are doing about this kind of monopoly.\r\n", "I called Comcast to up my internet speed. They told me I would have to pay 12/month for 50 mps. I did not know I was only getting 25 mps with my regular service. I tested my upload/download speed with their utility and I wasn't getting anything better than 32 mps. I called support and spent a total of 10 hours on two calls with tech support. The second call I was transferred 6 times. On the first call, the tech kept saying they could not see my device online so I was not connected to the internet. I told them I was on a VOIP line so it was impossible that I wasn't connected to the internet. This conversation went on for 30 min. I was on a 30 day trial for a new contract. I had been a customer for 17 yrs. They were going to send out a technician but I insisted that I not be charged for this visit no matter what the outcome. No one would commit to that so I canceled the visit. \r\n\r\nOn the day that the visit was supposed to be canceled a guy shows up at my door saying he is with Xfinity home security. He explained that he traveled 2 hours to get to my house and had paperwork that said I called. I told him we don't have the security package, never did. He sat with me for almost an hour and agreed that this was all a major blunder but said to go ahead with the new product installation as I was dropping Comcast and if I wanted to come back he would personally handle the contract. I said fine and the following week had their major competitor installed. \r\n\r\nSince install I have consistently had 58-63 mps with the internet and that's with 4 laptops, 1 Ipad and two phones. In addition, the competitor bundle of internet, TV and phone is 15$/month cheaper than what I had been paying for all three. Also, I have HD coming in on my TV which I did not have with Comcast. Have to admit that the new service does have less channels but for the price and service it is worth it. Besides, we don't watch a lot of TV anyway.", "Comcast first of all raised my bill $20 a month without warning or a notice. And now they charge me $40 for a house call when the technician did absolutely nothing. No wires were installed, no new modem, NOTHING. The tech sat at my computer, in my computer chair and went to speednet.com to check the speed on my connection and left. Said my internet is working fine!!! Horrible service and after speaking with ** from customer service for over an hour there is nothing they can do.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Since when do we charge the customer for something wrong with the service you offer to the customer!!! I wish I could go to Verizon but I can't because they do not service my area, so I am STUCK with CRAPPY COMCAST!!!", "If I could choose lower than one star I would. Absolute worst internet I have ever had. One minute it works fine then next it doesn't work at all. Every morning doesn't work, sometimes loads up to 50% then stops. Apartments need new choices besides Comcast.", "I was a relatively happy Comcast Business Internet customer for several years. I am a physician who is also an IT executive who works out of my home. We built a new house and discovered that Comcast did not offer service at the new location. When we attempted to disconnect the service they would not do anything without my account number. We were on e-billing and the account number was not included in the billing notice. All of our business paperwork was packed and in transit so not available. I spoke with at least 6 different CSRs over a two month period in which several things were promised but not followed up on; sending a paper bill (promised on 3 occasions) which would include the acct. number; a supervisor would call (on 4 occasions, only the last time did it occur); and I was to be transferred to a higher authority and call dropped 3 times. \r\n\r\nFinally in late January, a sympathetic CSR (many were not, some were concerned but didn't know what to do) took the time to directly contact a supervisor who could help with the disconnect and who finally sent me the documentation for a Voluntary Disconnect that included my account number (this process took approximately 45 minutes to accomplish, but a mere pittance compared to the approximately 5 hours I had spent to this point). I filled out the form immediately and returned it. Now, 2 months later I am still receiving bills for service that was no longer being used for 4 months. I was informed that it takes 60 days to perform a disconnect.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay the 2 months of fees, starting in November, if that is what my contract calls for. However, I am not willing to pay for 4 months. In addition, my time is too valuable to have to spend this much time for ANY business related service. I have heard horrid reviews of poor service by Comcast but never in my life would I have anticipated that shutting off my internet would be this difficult, and expensive.\r\n", "We have always been very pleased with Comcast tech support. But they must have decided to save some money, because today I had a terrible experience. I was calling for help with an app that wasn't working properly. I had to go through about 5 min. of robo call to get an agent. Eventually I had talked with 3 agents, none of whom were able to help. Despite giving my phone number at least 3 times, when I was cut off with the first agent (their mistake) she didn't call me back. So back to the robo call and 2 agents later, no help at all. They have outsourced and each of the 3 agents had a strong accent and talked very fast so it was hard to understand them. This is the first time I've thought about getting a different internet provider.", "Program captioning in which spotlighted Democratic candidates or representatives are consistently mis-labeled and certain politically \"inconvenient\" content is sidelined (Continuum not included in Watchathon Week and all episodes have to be purchased) and documentaries with populist bias are virtually nonexistent.\r\n", "Had connection problems and Comcast sent out tech 2 times never fixed, also never got any feedback. This all started happening when my 2 year contract was up and I was on a month to month charge. Called and got on a new contract and problems seem to have gone away. Sure hope this is not how they are running their business. But who are you going to get for service.", "Very very slow service on weekends, holidays and after local schools let out. Comcast has badly oversold its capacity to serve its customers.", "In April, 2014 I signed up with a Comcast door-to-door agent to replace my DirecTV with a Comcast Quad package which included TV, Internet, Telephone, and Home Security. In the contract the monthly charge was $128.95 for the 1st year, $149.94 for the 2nd yr. and $189.90 for yr. 3 and on. After about 5 months I noticed my credit card charge was already over $180 per month. After no resolution with Comcast, I contacted the WA State Attorney Generals office who then contacted Comcast with my complaint. After some discussions with a Comcast agent I was told I was actually being undercharged. I found out on my most recent bill I am now being charged $232 per month. Although I have been reasonably satisfied with the 4 services I signed up for, I am totally dissatisfied with this change in my monthly cost, and am now trying to find out how much I will be charged to cancel these 4 services.", "I have been a Comcast customer over 20 years and satisfied with the service. 2 months ago I started having problems with my internet and home service. Television was never interrupted. I was told since I live close to RR tracks, the signal could interfere with my service. I was also told same story about the Air Force base. Once that lie was disproven, I was told to move my modem to an outlet that only modem would use as modem was not getting enough power. Still getting kicked off internet and no phone service. \r\n\r\nThe next day I replaced the modem @ Comcast and all the power lines and cable they supplied. Still getting kicked off internet and no phone service. @ the request of Comcast I replaced the splitter at my expense. I finally get fixed (I hope) then asked for a credit and was told I was lying, that I never called about this problem. Demanded to speak to someone else about getting a credit and was told this would not fix the problem! I agreed it would not fix the problem but make me feel better about paying for a service I could not use. I finally hung up. I will call everyday and ask for credit .\r\n", "I have been a long time customer with Comcast - 11+ years at one location. Overall my service with them has been great! Their Customer Service Department has always been helpful and would \"talk me off the ledge\" whenever I was upset (which was not often) - UNTIL NOW! Several weeks ago I called them to just \"inquire\" about the cost of a popular fight that my boyfriend wanted to order (Note: I was just \"inquiring on the fee not to order). During this call the young lady mentioned she could LOWER my bill by offering me this \"new technology DVR\". I am not a technical person but always interested in lowering my bill if the service would not change - only would improve! She \"assured\" me it would go from $143/month down to $121/month. She did not inform me of any install fees or equipment fees. She said it would just be less with better technology. I agreed and scheduled a time for a Technician to come and install it.\r\n\r\nA Contract Working (very nice young man) arrived and installed the new DVR. I was impressed with all the features and I was excited about all of its features. (record 4 shows at one time as opposed to just two). After he left on that Saturday morning it was great for less than 24 hours. I was having to unplug the DVR to \"reboot\" the system, wait 10 minutes for it to reconnect. Sometimes this would work - other times not all. I would go several hours without any service and was forced to watch a small t.v. in my bedroom and forced to watch commercials! And now it doesn't work at all during the evening. :-( Also, the internet is running very poorly now as well, takes anywhere from a minimum of 5 minutes to as long as 12 minutes to connect. I've never had such poor service with Comcast. Horrible!!\r\n\r\nI have spent most of my evenings talking/complaining to Comcast. I have had a technician come out to rectify the problem. He spent a half hour fixing connections in my walls. That seemed to work for about a day. I then got my first bill. What a nightmare experience that was. The bill was for $355. I immediately got on the phone with Comcast to have that error rectified. The original call I made to just \"inquire\" about the cost of the fight - the woman from Comcast scheduled the fight on my bill. She also loaded me up with Triple Play (DVR, internet, and phone). I do not even own a home phone line. Ugh! I also had installation charges and fees that were never explained to me. After 2.5 hours of talking to Comcast Supervisors they were able to \"talk me off the cliff\". All the charges were waived - including a $70 fee to send a Technician to my house to fix this DVR issue - which this fee was NEVER explained to me either. \r\n\r\nThis is Comcast equipment that has never worked correctly and they are CHARGING the consumer to make it right. What??? After much energy and time they lowered my bill below $100 and gave me three movie channels and they guaranteed me that my bill will remain at this rate for two years. After three weeks of virtually no service, after nightly phone calls to Comcast, after scheduling another Technician to come out to see if they can rectify this ongoing issue I have decided it is not worth it any longer. I want my old DVR back. Now they tell me that they are phasing out the old Legacy DVR - we will all be forced to use this new technology that doesn't work. I will be leaving Comcast soon!", "Have had Comcast for almost two months. I've experienced constant connection problems with buffering and just getting kicked off altogether. I've called once to fix it and will call again. I've also ran speed tests on Internet and I'm only getting 30 mbps... My Internet package is the 50 mbps. Oh yeah... Recently the ceo of Comcast sent a letter congratulating me on receiving their new blast.. Now my Internet will be 75 mbps. What a joke. These ** people are something else.

A lady ask me to do phone trouble shooting, still not working, so she said the modem defective, she will send me another one in 3~5 business days. After 1 week did not receive. I call, they said sometimes it takes longer. Another week (so it is 2 week) I called back because still did not receive the modem. The CS said, that he cannot locate any order sent out, so he said there is no modem sent out yet, because he just found the work order. I request to talk to Supervisor. The Supervisor talk to me and give me solution that the next Monday (I called on Saturday), tech will come to my house at 7~8 am. Monday morning my sister in law wait on the sofa next to front door from 6:30 am to 9:30 am, nobody come. She even called me if I give them the right address, I said yes.\r\n\r\nSo when I came home the next Sunday July 26 I called Comcast. She said she only have next appt on August 3. I said I need it earlier because it's more than a month to connect my service and my daughter need to finish her homework on early August. \"And why the tech not come?\" She cannot answer. I ask for Supervisor. The Supervisor need me to review everything of my story again, but he keep cutting the story, and when I ask if the Comcast tech really came to my house that Monday, he answer, \"I cannot say yes or no.\" I don't even know what that means so I ask a higher manager to talk, But He (initial D) insist that he is the one who responsible to solve my problem, and refuse to let me talk to someone else. \r\n\r\nSo I said I cannot understand him, and I ask \"should I just close my account?\" He said \"you can do it, if that's what you want to do\" and he said he's going hang up on me because I cannot talk the higher manager. Only they the one who can call me. So he hang up on me. Around 10 minutes later he (initial D) the same person call me back at a more calm voice (he was aggressive on the first call) and said that's the earliest appt he can give to me but he don't even have the early morning. So he even can only give me the next day August the 4th morning and warn me if 7~9 its mean the tech can come at 9 and I have to answer their phone call and that they can finish the job for hours and hours later so I have to be ready to stay home all the hours. Which is mean he warn me I cannot go to work. He keep insist he is in the right position after fail to connect my internet for more than a month.\r\n\r\nThis is a ridiculous situation and not even one word of sorry they said and keep arguing with me after keep breaking all their promise. So watch out customers.", "I had blast for over 2 years. Recently Comcast increased my price to $70 from $40 and told me that my speed is increased to 75 mbps.

I call in and try to contact support and I get thrown through a roundabout of machines only for them to tell me they can't do anything about it. Comcast is the worst internet provider I have ever seen. They don't care about giving you service. They don't care if you are satisfied. They don't even want to provide you with good service.

Never give them your money.", "I'm so tired of the excuses I get for lose of cable. It rains - I lose!!!

I had one only spend 5 minutes in my home -- RUDE, gave me no name, and told me to call tomorrow for a new tech that can fix my problem. My sisters have AT&T and don't lose as much as I do.

That's an amazing statistic! And to top that off, I live in SWFL, the lightning capital of the world!!! I have internet speeds up to 90 megabytes down, and up to 12 megabytes up, I have unlimited US/Canada/PR/Guam calling, and a few hundred channels to watch at a cost of $160 a month.\r\n\r\nPeople complain about the cost of cable, but the way I look at it it's a great deal, and a lot of service for the money spent.

But now I can talk all I want without the worry of how many long-distance minutes I was using, and how much it cost. In addition, I have blazing fast internet which keeps everyone in my household connected to the whole world!\r\n\r\nIn an earlier post I read about someone complaining that if they pay for a service, electric, water, or cable, they expect cost-free service and maintenance. First off, people tend to forget that TV is a luxury, not a necessity! Secondly, if your kitchen sink is leaking does the water company come out and fix it for free? If a light switch is broken, does the electric company fix that for free? Then why do people expect that if you have 35 year old coax wiring in your home that it's the cable companies problem? I do electrical work, and must tell you that 30 year old RG59 coax cable will not reliably support today's technology.

I asked, \"Why so long?\" and their response was that they had other jobs to fulfill. I asked why I would have to wait since it was their error and they had no reason other than \"that is the way it is.\" Needless to say, I changed companies and am saving $102 a month for the same services! What a rip-off and poor customer service. It always pays to compare. I definitely learned something.", "I worked for Comcast for a few years as a billing rep. There are a few customers who often call in to cheat the system, with things such as \"I didn't order that PPV\" etc. However, there are legit customer complaints. We in the billing department did our best to listen to their concerns and help them out. My boss at the time, ** (out of the Beaverton, Oregon office), said his sister called into Comcast to get service. They promised her free install charges, but when she received the bill, she was charged installation fees. All the stories we heard about shady sales reps was quite true. He was upset. I'm not sure what happened after that though. \r\n\r\nWhen I had quit Comcast for a different employer, I was helping my fianc\u00e9e (poor college student) with her Comcast bills. We called to downgrade and were transferred a few times, and finally to their retention department. The retention rep promised they would lower the bill by about $25. The next bill that arrived did not reflect that. We called again and spoke with 2 people, one of whom used to be a coworker I knew in the Advocates department. They claimed there was absolutely no records of the call we made. We canceled the Comcast service in response. \r\n\r\nNot too long ago, I hear of Comcast's partnership with UPS.

Needless to say, an unrelated issue arose where I now have to file for bankruptcy so I stopped paying for Comcast (since I'm down to $150 in the bank anyways). I am surely going to include that evil company in my debt discharge list because that is the only way to fight their cheating unreturned equipment charge.

I have never streamed a movie, nor play games, never uploaded music etc., immediately call and inquire. Billing points out that three courtesy credits given already and why wasn\u2019t I aware?? Because the \"robo\" notification I am supposed to receive is not going to my correct phone #, although billing attest they have the correct #. \r\n\r\nCS is standing by the fact that the robo calls went to a cell phone no longer owned by me for over 2 years. So I call troubleshooting who is of no help. No sending out a tech to see if router is good, no walking me thru seeing how many devices are on my router, no comparison of monthly usage whereas normally I use less than 50gb in a month. Am told they are working on a ticket which a month later their solution was to correct my phone #. \r\n\r\nThe tech that originally installed the new equipment happened to be my neighbor, since fired from Comcast and moved out 2 mos ago, but his buddies who still live there told me he often left a small door open in security and accessing neighbor's wifi... while he only installed mine on block. He was often \"troubleshooting\" neighbors equipment on off time. I got directed to them after finding out that when turning off all my devices and getting into router, there were 9 devices still listed. So I report this to Comcast, who does nothing.... no tech sent out, no discussions with CS and doesn't even get annotated in a file till January. \r\n\r\nOnce finding out wifi is being used by others, immediately took actions to correct and no problems since but once again with no tech support and have spent the last 3.5 months with tickets opened that go nowhere, another 200 in connection/dis fees, and at least 2-4 hours every fifth day to get reconnected while these supposed tickets are under review. CS has even informed twice that everyone's first data overage credit is never shown on any bill, and one of my points was that regardless of who used data, my third credit should have been the 550. So how would any customer actually know how many times they exceeded data limit as the first credit is not annotated anywhere? \r\n\r\nSo as a last ditch effort try the online help... Spent another 3 hours three nights ago, yet another escalated ticket opened with guarantees to be contacted within 48 hours. 48 hours go by, get back online requesting status of ticket only to be told \"something\" was sent to my personal email address and guess what, they send it to my email with all caps and I never get it. So another escalation ticket gets opened up tonight and services have been off for 5 days and counting.. So Comcast list of issues, notifications never received, no help or support identifying problem and or correcting, billing hours involving \"third\" courtesy credit, sending out questionable tech for installations and for all this joy they want almost 900 dollars in overages/disconnects and I have had no service for 5 days\r\n", "I signed up 6 months ago for a TV-Internet bundle from Comcast for $80 a month for 2 years.

It's not right for a company to do that to customer just because they can and get away with it. New to the Texas area and I have learned to do your research on companies before accepting their services. I would not ever recommend Comcast to anyone.", "Comcast, a company only out to get money. I say this because I feel that this company, from since we started with them in 2013 has always over charged us, made us waste time waiting on them to come to our home to get service and even when we were going through hardships and couldn't pay the full bill, has no courtesy for us and didn't want to work with us. I spoke to a supervisor named **, he was so arrogant and came up with some solution to only give me service for one day and then had the guts to tell us that he is going to charge us 2 reconnection fees. I Was very frustrated with him and just decided to cut the service off completely. I dealt with this bs service for too long. I would never recommend this company to anyone, I will tell everyone to go with At&t and just avoid ever going to comcast. I Hate them with a passion.", "I ordered service back in January. At the time I ordered it they told me that I only pay $39 for installation. I had installation guy came in and installed the product. Next month I got bill with installation fee of $39 which I agreed on and paid and next month I got another bill with another charge of $39. I was going back and forth with Comcast on phone. Just called them today and they give me good story that installation fee its only to call installation guy in just to come and look at you at your house! In order for him to install the product you need to pay additional money! THIS COMPANY IS VERY TRICKY AND WILL TRY TO RIP YOU OFF OUT OF NOWHERE. DON'T USE THEM. IT'S A BIG MISTAKE THAT I DID. INTERNET SERVICE HAS LOTS OF OUTAGE AND IT'S NOT STABLE! Waste of money!\r\n", "I had no problem while I was using the service. The problem started when I closed the account, because of inter-state move. When I closed the account and went to the service center to return the equipment, they asked me for a switch that I've never received. They charged me around $40 (don't remember the exact amount) which made me really angry. I demanded to talk to a manager who was not helpful at all. I ended up paying and forgot about it.\r\n\r\nA couple of years later, when I applied for a loan, the loan officer came up to me and told me that there was an unpaid bill to Comcast which went to collection agency. Seriously? Before I close my account, I made sure that there's no bill to pay and they let me close the account which I believe because they didn't have any problem with that. I did not get a single notice or explanation and honestly I think this is one of their business models - ripping off the customer for no reason. I will never ever use Comcast again. This is the largest scam company.", "I moved to a new apt and - even though I have FIOS -- Xfinity pop up asking me to sign up. Continues to pop up and pop up. I clicked on the \"manage my preferences\" click and opted out. But Nooooo. A day later, there it is. Same laptop, same email address. I called and called and got an alternate # to call. After hold for 20 minutes, it hung up on me. What can I do?", "During a period of 2 months, I have been trying to solve the problems I have with Comcast. Expend hours on the phone. Send letters. Nothing has been done.\r\nFirst, I updated the internet to Business, expecting to have a faster speed. Nothing has change but the bill, yes went up very high. The home phone was added to the business and have it back to the residential took me 2 months and several calls. Finally I have it back, but they gave me a temporary number while they make the changes. Guess what? When I make phone calls, the number that appears in the callers ID's is not mine - is the temporary one. Usually my bank pay my bills, but this month I check the Comcast bill and noticed charges for services that I never asked for. They keep billing me for the internet besides the bill I pay for the Business. Double charges. This is the worst company I ever had. Thinking in change to another internet provider.", "This has got to be THE WORST internet service EVERRRR. So slow. Have Chromecast and the Movies have to reload every three Minutes (that's being generous). It takes like give to ten Minutes and I have to restart. Takes like three hrs or more to watch a normal length movie. To search the web... also takes more than double time. I usually turn off wifi and just use Sprint which also sucks but NOT AS BAD AS COMCAST!! That's sad. Your internet sucks and cable costs way too much. Unfortunately it's my only choice.

I had arranged for new 75 mbps Blast! service to be installed today to replace my 18 mbps U-verse Internet (btw 12 mbps taken up by U-verse TV) between 10am and 12 noon, and appreciated the email and calls confirming the time. I was able to rearrange my phone calls and appointments, and put the dog in the crate. Thank you Comcast for respecting my time, the only resource I cannot get back.\r\n\r\nAt 11:53, no one had called or shown up, so as a proactive customer service center you had me call into your 800 number, which asked if I was calling about my installation, and then proceeded to inform me that you were unsure when a technician would arrive, and transferred me to Shandra in customer service. Shandra told me my tech was on the way. In fact, Shandra was so good, that Shy (escapee from Inside Out - and yes that is her name) from the Sacramento OC Dispatcher team called at 12:05 to inform me my tech was running late and would be there in about 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nAt 12:20, because of the proactiveness of Comcast, I called customer service again, figuring that the tech had to take lunch. I mean, no appointments are scheduled between 12-1 according to Comcast and they are subject to hourly wage laws. I spoke to two people including a manager who offered me $20 gift card or 3 months of a premium service for my time. Um, did you see I only have Comcast Internet, not Comcast TV? \r\n\r\nOh yes, I was told that unlike Domino's Pizza (yep, Comcast brought up Domino's!!), who can track my pizza to my house, Comcast does not know where their tech's are until they press a button on a phone or laptop. Hello, 2015 calling - if a tech does not enter an update 15 minutes before the next call, perhaps they are going to be late, and you may want to proactively notify the next customer? Comcast mentioned that they were going to be having such a service for customers in the future, so you will now be able to look up where the techs are not supposed to be. I think it will be an Apple Maps program they use to locate their techs.Or just look up Domino's to find your Comcast tech.\r\n\r\nAt 1pm, I called Shy in dispatch because Comcast expects me to follow up with them first when someone does not show up. Shy paused and asked if I had cancelled my service, because the person she had scheduled to show up by 12:20 had a cancelled ticket from me. She apologized and said it was a Comcast issue (be still my heart) and she would arrange a new call between 1pm and 3pm today. At 1:38 Comcast called me (woo hoo! I am special!) and told me the tech would be at my home between 1 and 3pm (it was 1:38pm) and more than likely would be here by 2pm. \r\n\r\nAre you sensing a pattern? 2:03, let's call Comcast up to see how their automated system is working. Hello \"we are unsure of the arrival time of your tech, please hold for an agent.\" John comes on the phone, and he is good, and empathetic, and talks about under committing and over performing. He wants to take ownership of the issues - now someone is talking my language - and will call me back to follow up to see how the installation goes.\r\n\r\n3pm, who let the dogs out? Me, they were tired of being cramped up. 3:07pm, called Sacramento dispatch to talk to my Pixar friend Shy, no answer went into some IVR hell with options such as \"choose 4 for Not Home Service\". Hung up, called 800 number. My computer friend again said unsure when tech would arrive, passed me to an agent. She is trying to connect me to a supervisor. They are all busy exceeding customer expectations on other calls, and I ask her if she can have an agent call me back. \r\n\r\nI was in tears, begging, pleading, on my knees - please stop the Xfinity, I mean insanity! She said \"no\", there is no option to have a manager call me back, but they review all these types of cases so they can resolve them and prevent from happening again. I asked her, \"do you resolve these issues without talking or following up with the customer directly?\" And she said\u2026 wait for it\u2026 \"yes\". I asked her \"how can you provide customer service without involving the customer? How do you not have an option to have a manager or supervisor call a customer back?\"\r\n\r\nAs I was on the phone with the customer service person the tech showed up. His name is NoName or we can call him Tech 7546. He never introduced himself. As he walked in carrying dirt on his shoes (btw AT&T tech all put on booties over shoes when they come into homes) and smelling of an overflowing ashtray (he does not drive for Uber in his spare time) he said he was from Comcast (thank you!), and then he was on time for his 3pm-5pm appointment. Valerie came home and could not park, because NoName parked in her spot in driveway instead of on street.\r\n\r\nHe was on time! Thank you #Xfinity! I love Comcast for showing up on time 3 hours late. But they continued to exceed my expectations, my pretties! \"Hmm, there is no cable here, you need to have one installed\". \"Yes\", I responded, \"just like the work order I put in requested. Let me show you the attic access I have had cleared out for you all week\". NoName went outside, checked the box, came back with his ladder and more dirt because Comcast wants us to exercise after they leave, thank you for thinking about me. He looks in attic and says, \"I cannot fit in there. We need a smaller tech and it is hot in the attic. I cannot do this job\". \r\n\r\nNoName is skinnier than me, I can get in the attic, and we had 3 people in there last week cabling electrical and network cables without an issue. NoName leaves, head down, shoulders sunken back to his truck. 10 minutes later, I get a call from Comcast. They are calling me! Publishers Clearing House must be outside! What did I win? \"Hello\", she said, \"we need to reschedule for Saturday. The installation should be done early in morning because it is hot in the attic, in Florida, in the summer, during the day when we do our jobs.\" I asked her, \"like between 10 am-12 noon?\" She said \"yes\", but had an 8-9am opening. Oh Joy! Comcast will allow me to wake up earlier to set expectation of not showing up that much better!\r\n\r\nBut I missed John's call. Yes, John who wanted to help and take ownership called me back at 3:26, and apologized for not calling at 3pm. \"I see the tech arrived at 2:45, hope all went well and I will call you back shortly\". 2:45?? Well he is closest to the pin, and he did call back so I give him kudos for doing what he said. So now we wait, I called Executive Customer Relations in Philadelphia, where the difference between normal customer service reps and Executive ones is the Executive team has access to better drugs. They are on morphine and do not have any emotions after dealing with issues like this all day long. She tells me a manager will call me back within 24 hours. I asked her \"24 hours Comcast time?\" There was no response.\r\n\r\nSo now it is Minions time, the Amc 8 Movies Sunrise serves alcohol so it should make the movie even better. At least I will feel better, whilst I dream of little Comcast trucks driving around a neighborhood but never stopping anywhere. And I have XFINITY to thank for showing me how sales and customer service are supposed to work, and exceeding customer expectations. The $20 gift card or 3 months of premium cable service (did I mention I am only an Internet subscriber, not TV?) will go far to recapture the glorious moments of the past 8 hours, as there was the epitome of what a Friday should be.", "Worst service I've ever had. Our HOA gives us free TV from Comcast so they give us the cheapest internet equipment even when we return it for better equipment. And forget them sending anyone out.

Unfortunately, I didn't cancel in time to not be binding in a contract for 2 yrs.", "When I called to establish service they had to call me back. Their \"system\" was too slow to tell me if I was in their area. I then spent 30 minutes going through their options and establishing service. I received a call the next day and was told that even though I had set up a installation date and established service with them they could not come out and connect service on the first of the month because there was already service at the house. Until that was cancelled they could not install mine. I have moved numerous times and I have never heard this before. The representative was unwilling to try to explain the issue in a way that made any sense and would not let me speak to a manager.

I was told I could hook up the modem myself and be charged 9.95. If they had to send out a tech they would charge me 39.99 (no charge if it's no fault of my own). Well, guess what? I could not get the modem to work. Comcast sent a tech to my home. The tech told me it would never have worked because comcast sent me a modem for the wrong region. He went back to his truck and switched modems and it worked. I called customer service and explained what happened. The gentleman told me someone would get back to me through an email. Week and a half no word.\r\n\r\nI called comcast back and spoke with a woman and explained my situation again. She said she seen the notes and asked if I could hold while she consulted a supervisor. I waited on the phone 45 minutes and someone came on the phone asking for all the information again. I told her I was on hold and that someone was helping me. She said they transferred me to her (the payment center). Again I had to explained all the information. By this point I have been on the phone an hour and a half trying to get my bill straightened out. Now, this woman transfers me once again. This time I asked for a supervisor so I don't keep getting pushed off on someone else. I explained what the tech had said about the modem. She said comcast didn't have modems for different region. Comcast can come get their stuff. Very poor customer service.", "From the very beginning, we've had nothing but problems with Comcast's Internet service. The service will randomly drop and sometimes not return for hours. Every time we call regarding these happenings, Comcast blames our \"outdated hardware,\" regardless of the fact that own the most up-to-date Motorola modem that is on the market. Regardless, this is all beside the point.\r\n\r\nI've had a few dealings recently with Comcast support, and they've only seem to become more and more condescending and less helpful with each conversation. I currently work for Apple from home, and we're set to move into a different unit in our complex at the beginning of next month. Given that they advertise that their Movers Edge service provides a completely seamless transition between locations, I figured it'd be worth setting up a transfer. I was told the transition would take 48 hours. Correct me if I'm wrong, but 48 hours doesn't really fall under the umbrella of \"seamless\" as far as how most average human being interpret words. \r\n\r\nWe're not allotted time to move. We have to do it completely on our own time. So now, thanks to Comcast, I'm going to be forced to take an unpaid day (complete with negative attendance points) due to the fact that they're advertising more than they can actually do for you. Then again, I shouldn't be surprised at this point. Nothing ever works out how it should with this company.\r\n\r\nMy two biggest pieces of advice:\r\n\r\n1. Hire employees who are mentally capable of actually empathizing with customers, and who can even remotely come across like they have any idea what they're talking about.\r\n\r\n2. Advertise your services exactly as you provide them. I equate Comcast with used cars salesmen at this point. They do and say whatever they need to do to get you in, and then offer no help once you're there.", "I used Comcast and the internet never worked for a year.

I have been switched between channels approximately 8 times now, I have also been sent to their store for a replacement modem/router and nothing helps. They now tell me that I need a service tech and that I may end up paying for the service tech even though their product never worked to begin with. \r\n\r\nOf course one of their \"agents\" told me that I could buy an insurance policy for $5 a month so I would not be charged for the service visit.

YES, but the worst part is, I usually receive less than 10 mbps and sometimes a ridiculous reading of 1 or 2 mbps. I work from home and my internet disconnects at least FIVE times a day, impacting my productivity. I can't watch a Netflix movie entirely because I lost signal and I can't work wirelessly because the signal is \"schizophrenic.\" Comcast sent an IT tech who did nothing but to unplug and plug my modem and tried to engage me in \"Personal Business\" asking me to let him \"do the job\" outside of Comcast...totally unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe worst part...I was charged $70 for that atrocity. I was given a partial credit on that. Another technician visited my place and told me that the service cannot be improved. I consulted my neighbors and they told me that their service is very poor. Comcast has been negligent to improve the service in my building but have collected based on a bad service. When I called about this situation, the representative suggested me that the only thing to do is to change my speed connection to 100 mbps and bundle my services. He offered it as a courtesy for the horrible services, but I only received more mislead. I was charged with this \"change in speed\" and my bill went from $130 to $155, and my DVR services were suspended. When I called to inquire about it they told me that the DVR would cost extra.\r\n\r\nIn sum, I have been paying for an internet service of 50 mbps and I only receive 10 in average and sometimes as low as 1 mbps. COMCAST is aware of the situation but negligent to solve it. The building has a bad connectivity but they prefer to deal with each customer directly before solving the root of the problem. They charge money for a service they don't provide and they are negligent to solve it.\r\n", "We've been customers of Xfinity for about 6-7 months now, with horrible service from the get go. We have high speed internet, of about 7 Mbps, or at least, we're supposed to have that speed. My internet disconnects or crawls through speed THOUSANDS of times a day. This is no exaggeration. In the last five minutes, my internet has cut out three times. We've called Comcast SEVEN times now, and had all sorts of different service attempts, to still have horrible internet.\r\n\r\nWhat's worse? Every time they've serviced us our internet has gotten LESS reliable and SLOWER. We're paying 60 dollars a month for service we can't even use, and to get responses from a company that doesn't care (to put it politely and mildly). Even worse? We're stuck in a town with only two horrible providers, one of which is Comcast. They know it, too, and manipulate you for every dime.\r\n\r\nI'm a college student, primarily online. Xfinity's HORRID internet service has glitched out on me several times, causing failed exams, homework assignments, and completely lost assignments altogether. I'm paying not only for bad internet service (if you even want to consider service that hardly works as SERVICE) but also for the stress and hair-pulling of trying to get work done online when I can't even stay connected for more than a couple of minutes. If there's anything that represents foul corporations that steal from their clients, it's Comcast. I'd definitely prefer a root canal, labor, or a car accident than to deal with Comcast again.

Frontier is at my office and if I do have a problem, they are easy to get a hold of and make it a priority to solve the issue if I have one...", "Comcast is terrible. I don't usually do reviews, but this time I feel that the potential Comcast customers should know what they are getting into once they sign up for Comcast services. I have been with Comcast the past 5 years and I never saw the services so bad. I signed up for a triple play with maximum 125 MBPS blast internet speed. That was what I was told in the beginning. Everything went pretty well till this March when things started to go really awry.\r\n\r\nFirst the speed came down to about 40-45 MBPS. But I didn't complain much because it was still good enough for browsing. But in April, 2015 I wanted to watch some cricket matches (the world cup) by live streaming. I just could not get my TV stream anything. I complained to customer services, and after about 5 days they did send out a technician. Have you ever had a Comcast technician come and fix the problem for you? They are so bloody arrogant and make you feel so low. \r\n\r\nTypical attitude: How stupid are you not to be able to figure out the solution for yourself; They do something and tell you everything will be fine from now. And the problem remains and you have no idea what was the issue and what he fixed. They make you feel like they are bestowing a huge honor just by showing up to your door. They are always out of the door in 5 minutes max. So the problem remained and I complained to customers services again. After another week or so they let me know that maybe the problem is with the router. So they said someone will come and replace the router and everything will be fine.\r\n\r\nThe technician came, installed a new router and was out of my place before the router was actually online. Before leaving, he asked me to get an usb cable and other things from Amazon to speed up my services. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about when I am supposed to have a wireless connection for all devices and I have a small apartment and all devices are close to the router. Finally I decided I have had enough (my internet speed is now down to 15 MBPS) and I cancelled the services from June 4, 2015. I called them o/a May 24 and schedule return of all equipment. I also pay all my outstanding bills. Imagine my consternation I receive a new bill of $122 for services from June 4 to July 3, 2015. \r\n\r\nI called the customer services again and somehow navigate my way to speak to someone at the payments department. I tell him my problem and he asks me to call cancellation department and resolve this. I request him to send a note to cancellation department or maybe talk to them internally to resolve my problem. He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up. I guess in order to not be charged with bills for services not received, I shall have to call them again. So sad. Comcast used to be a good company. Next time I will choose a smaller service provider who will attend to my needs and solve my problem. I wish some of us will get together and file a class action suit to hold these Company to better standards. You pay a lot and in return you are treated so bad that it hurts.", "I contact both providers the same day to request an estimate. Both of them asked for my credit card #. They assure me it's only to make a computer to process the request & give the best rate. Well, a few days later, they both charge my credit card. I called them & finally they credit me. The worst was Xfinity. They claimed they cannot find me??? So I have to ask my credit card to stop payment.", "This is the first time writing a review about any company. I was having issues with connecting to my interest and had to call 5 times before giving up. 3 of their reps hung up on me and the other two transfer me to other department. I hate Comcast!!", "Comcast charged me for the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight that did not play. They claimed that shows up in their system as the event did play for 54 minutes, when in fact it did not. I have an SD box so I ordered it on the phone in Standard Definition and they charged me for HD. They said that in their system shows up as if I ordered from the box in HD. The fact is that I could not play the fight. When I try to call, the lines were super busy because apparently million of people were having the same issue. I've waited on the lines for approximately hour and a half and finally gave up and hang up. The charge did not show up in my account online, so I assumed I was not going to be charged with all that fuzz going on. And of course I forgot about it because believe it or not some people do have to work for a living and can not be on the phone all day and make our lives about Comcast.\r\n\r\nOf course a month later the $99 dollars show up on my account and when I called they said it was too late, that I should have call earlier. When I said that I call that same day, they said that I should have call the next day. I tried to explain that I can not make my life about them, but that did not help. I spoke to a guy in Spanish and he escalated the claim saying that by mistake the show was provided in HD and that couldn't be played it on a SD box. Of course a week later the charge was still on my account. When I called they said that my claim was denied by their credit department (Of course they did not bother notifying me). And the new representative told me that despite the fact it was in HD my box can play it anyway. Of course I'm technically savvy and I'm telling you the pay-per-view did not play in the 810 channel they claimed.\r\n\r\nUnder pressure he gave me the option to discount $25 dollars that that's the only thing I'm ever going to get. And of course after having fought with 3 reps I was emotionally exhausted and finally gave up I took the $25 discount because it was not worth my emotional health and my time to keep fighting for $99 dollars. Of course by giving me those $25 dollars under cohesion they protect themselves from further claims I suppose. But regardless I feel this is a great injustice, especially after giving Comcast thousands upon thousands of dollars and they do not have any client consideration. And of course because they are a monopoly I can't cancel their service, because they are the only ISP in my area. So the multi-billion dollars company managed to get away and steel $99 dollars from my account.", "I have been facing extremely slow internet connection and frequent disconnections for the last two and a half months. I have spent at least 10 hrs on the call to their customer care. Three technician visits and one scheduled, the trouble with service continues. Since I didn't get any internet they promised to compensate for the time and here they start malpractices as I should put it. Compensation did show up on the online account so I didn't pay anything for that month and I was at least relieved. But when I was to pay this month\u2019s bill everything from the last month appeared back and an additional 70$ charge was mentioned for technicians visit.\r\n\r\nI did what any troubled consumer would do, I called their billing department. What happened on the call was shocking least to say. The lady on the phone kept on reading from the present bill and was absolutely deceitful & impolite. She kept on heckling me throughout the call and was venting spleen. After 45 minutes of discussion she offered me to take out the technician fee and told me to pay for rest of the bill even for the time when I couldn't use the internet.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is, cheating the consumer is not going to fructify and with a bitter heart I am saying that if you can't provide the services and solutions then don't promise to your customer. You exist because we are using your services. The day we decide to move away you will cease to exist. I leave the decision to the readers of this review to decide for themselves whether to back the unethical practices.", "My wife and I WERE going to change our internet/cable service. I took the day off of work to be home for the appointment. My wife gave the rep scheduling the appointment my contact info and also put me on the \"account\" so I could interact with Comcast. The rep did NOT take any of my info and log it in. Day of installation appointment, they called my wife to say no one was home at 1:14 P.M. The garage door and the front door were WIDE open and clearly visible from the street (50 feet from edge of street). \r\n\r\nBy 1:16 P.M., my wife had given them my number, and they found the time in 2 minutes to call and leave a message saying that I would have to reschedule. I filed a complaint with the BBB. They attempted to contact me after I had previously (7 days earlier) told them to remove my number and email from their database. They still wanted me to establish service with them which would require me to take more time off work (unacceptable) and offered a $25 credit. What an insult. Never doing business with them. EVER.", "My family and I have been customers with Comcast for many years. When Comcast just started, they were a really good company. As years went on, they got worse and worse. They have the WORSE customer service team. Their information is never, ever accurate. Every time you call, they always give you different information. Not one representative never gave me correct info. Their bills are always wrong. They never keep their promises or commitments. They never call back when they say they will. They charge sooo much. Worse of all, they have horrible service. Especially the Internet. I feel like I'm on dial-up.", "Customer placed on hold over 30 minutes waiting to talk to comcast rep. 1.) Conversation interrupted frequently several times during conversation. Each time dialed for reconnect, a long time waiting period (over 30- minutes). 2.) Recording voice process flawed \"limited choices to solution.\" 3.) Voice refers to comcast rep. 4.) Additional waiting time - over 30 minutes waiting time again. There were 3-day wait before my problem was solved!! And service interrupted (3) days.\r\n", "So, I was a loyal Comcast customer for over 10 years, beginning in 2000. Then, I started having trouble with some of my services and decided to give AT&T U-Verse a shot, since they finally showed up in my community. Loved it, loved them, and loved their consistent attention and care for their customers not to say they don't have issues at times, but they handle things so very well that they make you feel bad for even bringing it up. That said I had to move, just up the street to a new community, and I am being forced to use Comcast (Bulk services?). I upgraded to the triple play back on the 5th of June, and was told that the equipment would be delivered within 3-5 business days. Great. Fantastic. \r\n\r\nOn the 10th I called just to see where things were, to ask when I might be receiving my equipment, and was told that the order was still sitting in their system with a \"pending\" status, so had never been forwarded to the warehouse that ships the equipment. I asked how that could possibly have happened, and I also asked what would have been the outcome had I not called to check. Dude said, \"No one would have known if you had not called\" What?! So I said, \"Alrighty then. Let's get that fixed -- and by the way can you send that to me fast-tracked, since I am now without TV, Internet, or phone?\" He said, \"No problem. Just one thing though, you're gonna need to pay $29 for the quicker shipment.\" At that point I was so frustrated that I just said whatever and he said they would \"share\" the cost with me. You know, like it was MY fault that they didn't do their jobs correctly the first time. Fine. \r\n\r\nOn the 15th, still no equipment. Third call. \"Oh, wait. We just now sent that package out to you and we don't have any actual tracking information to help determine when you will actually get the package. Could be tomorrow, could be a couple of days after that.\" Package showed up on the 16th. But wait, there were only two of the four pieces of equipment I was expecting. Fourth call. Rep says, \"Your account activity actually shows that it's been cancelled...and it looks like prior to the cancellation, there were only two pieces of equipment ordered.\" What?! Yep...four reps and two supervisors later, I am being told that I now have to wait for a call tomorrow (18th) for the account to be straightened out and if I try to make any changes to the account (since none of the reps actually got my itemization correct), then \"the audit department would make it so that NO SERVICES would be connected at my location\" What?! \r\n\r\nThe last rep I spoke to acted as if I had called back all those times to make changes to my order, when in fact, each time I called back -- BECAUSE OF THEIR TOTAL AND COMPLETE LACK OF COMPETENCE -- I had them read back to me what was shown in the order and IT WAS NEVER CORRECT. How is that my fault? These folks really don't give a crap about customer service or just plain SERVICE for that matter. I just don't get how they can all be so callous regarding how they affect our lives. I know they have a ton of customers, and I know they have it so that you are basically stuck in certain situations or areas; however, know this...depending on where you live, work, & play, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THEM AT ALL. I have the option to split up my services and only take the Basic/Expanded that the complex forces us to use and I will use another company for my internet and phone. \r\n\r\nANY OTHER COMPANY. Almost everything you watch on Cable can now be accessed through the internet and all sorts of apps. Hulu Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, etc., are now viable options to completely do away with cable. Comcast has basically ensured that I will now be one of the loudest voices in the \"down-with-Comcast\" arena. My puny little dollars may not make a big difference to them but by God, I will spend the rest of my days trying to convert as many folks as I can reach. They are ridiculous. THEY NEED TO TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES TO ACTUALLY KNOW THEIR PRODUCT AND TO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS ON THE OTHER END OF THE DOLLARS THEY COLLECT EVERY DANG MONTH!", "Comcast has not provided the service they promise. I purchased a 100mb/sec internet plan and have not received consistent service since going with Comcast in 2008. Constant data hits (which they can't seem to detect) and, when calling to find out what the problem is, their response: \"We don't see any problems from our end.\" \"We can send a technician out, but you'll be charged a service fee if a problem is not found\". Well, of course they aren't going to find a problem, because the problem is on their end. They oversell their servers and their data transmission lines become inundated and the flow is inhibited. Comcast relieves themselves of this responsibility because they use third party resources as a transfer medium. I am done with Comcast and will NEVER go back. I'll pay my 211.00 early termination fee, turn their box back in and be done.", "Do not get Comcast. They--this business is not recommendable, the internet is poor poor poor, channels are horrible, options and price is way too high. Be aware of this big American scam!", "This is absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with. I spent 4 hours trying to resolve an issue. In the process was told that my banking information that I gave to a phone rep was never received but that I should trust them with it again. I was talked down to numerous times by a manager. I missed family time to try to resolve this and at the end of the night I have no resolution and I had 2 hours of chat transcripts of me going in circles. One rep actually tried to contact the department that I was trying to get a hold of and ran into the same situation of being in the queue for 20 min and then kicked to a random voicemail due to waiting too long. This is ridiculous.", "I've been complaining for months about slow internet around 1 to 5 mbps and not able to open emails half the time. Finally they agreed to send someone out after I went and got another modem from Comcast and bought a new wifi router and still no improvement. The day before they came out, I was getting 3.34. The day they sent a tech, I was getting 25 to 60 mbps. I have a history on my speed tests every month for years, and they haven't had that speed for over 6 months, except the day the tech came out. They have been throttling my account. It's so wrong!!!", "It has been without doubts the worst Customer Experience ordeal. 08/02/2015 - Call Comcast sales to requesting cable+Internet+phone service for my new home as I have been recently relocated to Connecticut, and subscribed for a 2-year agreement for Starter XF Triple Play bundle. Paid $197.45 for install+1st month of service. 08/24/2015 - Technician arrives to my address on-time but says that he cannot install as there is no cable from the pole to my house and he needs to call the \"higher fix\" team. He says somebody will contact me to reschedule for a second appointment. 08/26/2015 - Nobody has call in two days so I contact Customer Service and they schedule a second visit for 08/27/15.\r\n\r\n08/27/2015 - Technician#8023 arrives on-time but after inspecting - same thing the first technician did - he says that he can't continue and will need the \"Construction Team\" to schedule a THIRD visit, and reiterates that somebody will call me to schedule it. Technician left a copy of a Construction Drop Referral Form JOB # 162031.\r\n\r\n08/27/2015 - I contacted Customer Service by web chat just to find out that my account was Voluntarily Closed - needless to say I didn't do such a thing. After spending more than an hour the agent representative did not offer any solution that was not opening a new service request from scratch. I will not expand on how many times I explain the situation as just to write it down seems a waste of time, but I am attaching the full transcript.", "I first got Comcast over a year ago at my apartment. I got everything set up and ready to go while on the phone with them, and asked them if I could make my first payment ahead of time. Whomever I spoke with proceeded to tell me my first month was free since I was a new customer. I did not remember ever seeing that anywhere, but was also happy when they mentioned it. So my first bill comes and it is double what my bill was supposed to be and it says I have a late fee added since I did not pay my first bill!\r\n\r\nConfused I called the customer service which btw is terrible!!! The lady I spoke with was so unbelievably rude I was in such shock. Telling me that I do not know what I am talking about, etc. She hung up on me eventually. I was so angry. They continued to add late charge fees even after I paid my bill. After 4 months of having Comcast I cancelled because I was so angry with the way they treated me. I swore I would never get them again...\r\n\r\nTo my luck, my new house I just moved into only receives Comcast in this area. So I signed up for Comcast internet and they quoted me 59.99 a month for a speed of 105. I picked up the modem and went to call to activate it. Comcast then told me my account had been cancelled. (WTF) I had just started service with them 4 days prior! So then I got transferred a total of 8 times and was asked to verify who I was 15 times making the phone call a total of 3 hours. Eventually I was able to get my original rate back for the same speed (or so they told me).\r\n\r\nI was not getting any internet whatsoever... The speed was sooo slow I could not even load one page on the internet. Angry and confused I call them back to now find out that I am paying 59.99 a month for a speed of only 50. They then proceed to put me on hold for 25 mins two times! Saying to have 105 speed I need to pay $20 extra a month. I am now not happy. After arguing they then reduce it down to only an extra $5 a month. So now my plan is $65.99 a month. I then proceed to ask for them to email me over my price sheet and contract so I have evidence and a paper trail of all of this and he tells me that he is not able to do that. I HATE COMCAST !!! What can you do to fight back against them if they try to overcharge me, etc. They make me worried to have them as a company. They are stupid, liars, and not trustworthy.", "Comcast, THE WORST! Installer left without system up. NO internet, NO cable, NO phone. ALL DAY to get customer no service to help and get tech back to my house. NO apology, NO help! Fast Internet Speed, not true.", "Cable box malfunctioned (2 months of \"We'll send signal to correct it\"). Returned the box at Factoria (Bellevue, WA) service center on Aug 3, 2015. My turn was skipped. When I complained, a staff told me that \"I called your name 3 times and you were not paying attention\" - not true. When I said (sorry to lose my temper, but...), \"that's **\", that staff tells me to \"Shut your mouth\". Called the manager to complain. Jacob ** never returned my 7 voicemails or 2 emails. Escalated the complaint to corporate (\"executive escalation\"). ** calls on Aug 24, with excuses that his phone has been malfunctioning for 2 months (hmm, corporate sure got through) and he did reply to my emails - hmm, nope. \r\n\r\nBoth corporate and ** promises credits. But, have not seen any on my statements. Apologies from staff and management were promised, but none received. In the meantime, I was billed for a DVR service which I have never had. Called to have the bill corrected, and the call center in India removes that DVR and my HD signal. No TV service for 4 days. (Finally corrected by in-house tech service). Yes, I may get some credit, but no evidence thus far.", "A year ago I was attracted by their promise to bill $59 a month for internet and TV, but skeptical. Never got to experience that agreement. If you are late in prepaying your monthly installment they will call you up to 7 times in one day. Evidently forgetting your demands to no longer call you. Never seen anything like it.", "I have used Comcast internet service for 15+ years, using a proxy email address at the IEEE so that my contacts see a consistent mail address irrespective of the ISP that I use. Last week I stopped getting mail. I received a message that I needed to switch from POP to IMAP and did so. No mail. I reset the account several times; received unfiltered mail for a day then it stopped. Tried logging into Comcast directly to see my mail and the time taken to log in was 10 minutes+. \r\n\r\nToday I have been 20 waiting 20 minutes to log into the mail server. In desperation I talked to their service line for an hour, half of it with a supervisor. They gave me a couple of ports to try and concluded that it was a Microsoft problem (I have used MS Outlook 2007 since it came out). I argued that that was ridiculous and their response was \"buy Outlook 2010 or 2013\". I am switching my mail service to Google and changing my proxy. Comcast's response time is intolerable for running a business, and their failure to deliver IMAP mail through Outlook is absurd.\r\n", "For anyone who wants a good laugh please read. There are many things that are common complaints made by customers, like taking hours on the phone, or bait and switch pricing, or never getting an issue fixed. And we know Comcast knows, but they never admit it. Until today. Today, I called Comcast, because I'm in my 12 month promotional period and my price keeps getting increased. Below is what I learned.\r\n\r\nMy bill is in two parts, one part is promotional and has not increased, the second non-promotional part was increased. I was told this meant they were maintaining the promotional price. Comcast told me they had no power to change my price back, because it was set by the system. I asked to speak to the person in the company who sets prices. I was told that there is NO Comcast employee who sets prices, but that they're system generated.\r\n\r\nAfter, finding out the above, I came to the obvious conclusion that the sales people offer promotional prices, with no intention of the customer keeping them. After all, it is literally impossible for Comcast to maintain that price, because the computer can change prices at will, and no one in the company can undo it. To check my reasoning, I asked the Comcast employee on the line this same question who confirmed it. I explained the above and asked, \"So I was offered a promotional price and Comcast had no intention of giving me that price.\" She said, \"That is correct.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested just taking $X dollars off my price. I was told that wasn't an option for a price in the system. I then asked to speak to their IT group to get that fixed for her. She happily said, \"yes, of course.\" (I then asked her not to connect me. That would be worthless). Even better, Comcast has this recorded. I'd love to see how their leadership responds to knowing that their phones reps are telling customers that all their marketing is just a bait and switch scam.", "Service was disconnected for nonpayment.

I was so excited since I will move in to a new apartment on July 7th, 2015. I have called the number on the promotion letter @ 1024698. After 40 minutes on the phone with one representative (she was trying to get all my information and sell me to the package which I do not need), she told me they cannot offer me the package stated in the letter. Instead, they can offer me $34.99 per month internet with only 3Mbps. \r\n\r\nI was very frustrated but decided to call the number again (giving them another chance) to talk to another representative hoping he/she treats customer better. I asked him whether he can give me the price as stated in the promotion letter. The answer is straight no with no apology. I told him what I am going to do is not going to be Comcast customer and will write a review. He does not care. Here I am writing the review... Hoping you see it and now understand why Comcast is not a good business and losing its market share: dishonest and not caring their customers at all.\r\n", "So they tell me now that I'm getting 75 mbps internet speed. And often I do. But then again, often I end up with .35 mbps.. that's point 35. Slow enough that my internet service is useless and I have to leave my home to continue with my job. For years they have been coming to my house, trying to charge me $75 per trip to fix THEIR ISSUE. It's intermittently messed up so by the time they get around to helping me, it's ok again. And then they say things like, \"it's hard to fix something when it's ok when we get here.\" (I send them speed reports to prove it was slow.) The supervisors say they will do what it takes to fix it and then they do nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the techs get here they say things like, \"we saw the issues you are having in the office on our equipment so we know you are having issues\" but then nothing ever gets fixed.

They are way more expensive than what they should be if you think about what you are truly getting for the price. They should be ashamed. I definitely don't recommend them at all. Just because it seems like it might be a good deal at the time doesn't mean it really is. Too much ** and ignorance to deal with.

Sunday cable tech ran new lines to the house and left, NO signal from the new line, no internet all day, called 5 times and they assured me that MON. we would have service, guess what - NO service on Monday. Come to find out it was an open ticket for 8am to 8 pm. I lost my cool and they bumped me up to an \"escalated\" ticket for Tuesday. Guess what here it is Tuesday and NO tech no internet, I have called again at 5 more times and they said now they had me on an open ticket for all day... AGAIN! Now here it is going into Wed and I have an automated msg stating that I will have a service visit on Wed. from 1-3 pm. Let's see if this happens...\r\n\r\nI am SO frustrated at this whole ordeal, I don't even HAVE service and paid for it. The outsourcing aggravates me and every time I call I get some Indian csr with an English name like ** that has NO Clue to what's going on unless he reads my notations on my account which has been nothing but call after call after call waiting for a tech to activate my line for internet. I feel so stupid for disconnecting the other provider and it was ALREADY connected and running to my domicile!\r\n\r\nHere's what I learned, IF new cable has to be ran... that's what you get - ONE guy runs the cable, later a tech checks and activates the line on another date. NO MATTER how much or how many times you call, they will say anything to get you out of their hair, ANYTHING! The best thing to do is stay on the line as long as possible with them and hang up when done... why?

He listened and repeated back what my concerns were and turned me over to Amanda who also listened carefully and understood my frustration. She had Ben from Portland, Oregon who is charge of Arizona, contact me and he gave me what I needed. Amanda expedited my hook-up and I'm a happy camper. Why did I have to go through all that?

The guy at the store said my router, that was given to me by Comcast only a year ago, was super outdated and my internet was going at about half the speed.

Never called. I waited for their call but called them back a few days later and they sent me to another store in Dearborn MI on 9/10. This office actually existed. I went in and set up the account and was given a certain modem to buy at Best Buy. I went and bought the \"zoom\" modem they suggested. After waiting on the phone for over 2 hours I was finally directed to someone in the Philippines who hardly speaks English but told me that the modem I had bought was incorrect. \r\n\r\nI went and bought another modem they suggested and that one was Comcast approved.

Just ridiculous!\r\n\r\nI was reassured emphatically that the amount at the bottom of the page was the final charge plus the normal sales tax - the great promotion they had going, he said. THEN to top it all off, when I called and spoke to a sales representative (assuming it was all just a billing mistake), not only did they do NOTHING to fix the bill (in fact the charges were defended), but the woman PURPOSELY gave me the wrong date of 30 new install termination so I would have to pay the $230 early termination fee. Also, shockingly, an hour later my conversation with the sales representative all of our on-demand disappeared -- the system said we were not subscribed -- of which was supposed to be part of the promotion I signed up for... Coincidental? My gut knows better. Comcast is the worst company I have ever dealt with, completely unethical and shady. I am going back to Dish.\r\n", "I called to have a new installation for Xfinity internet. I was scheduled for 6 days later between 3 & 5 pm, what they called \"the guaranteed two-hour window.\" On that day no one called and no one showed to do the install. After spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone with them I was finally told no one was available to come that evening and they rescheduled the install ONE WEEK later. After repeated attempts to talk to a supervisor I was finally able to get them to agree to come two days later, but was given a 12-hour window. I had to take off from work. The install was completed at about 7pm and the installer left, but by 7:15 the service no longer worked. \r\n\r\nI spent another hour and half on the phone trying to get some resolution but I was told I would have to wait another 4 days. The next morning I called and spoke to a supervisor then finally asked to terminate the service. I was transferred to the \"Customer Retention\" department (this took about 45 minutes) who then assured me she could find a solution. She transferred me to a \"specialist\" in Florida who assured and promised me he would resolve the issue. He promised that a technician would call me in an hour. When two hours passed and I had not received a response I called and cancelled the service.\r\n\r\nIn the past I have dealt with Optonline, Verizon and AT&T. Never before had I been so deceived, received such poor service and witnessed such ineptness. Comcast is, without exaggeration, the worst company I have ever dealt with. In the end I lost out on two full days of work, spent a total of nearly 4 hours on the phone, been lied to a total of four times, sat through two missed appointments, and navigated through their phone system dozens of times (which is a barbaric experience).\r\n\r\nPlease note that the individuals who answer the phone are polite and attentive. This is not a criticism of them as individuals, but the company they work for is horrible. They do not care about their customers. They do not have systems in place for situations where things fall apart, and they are cold, impersonal and unresponsive. Do not let their advertising slogans and ads fool you. You will not like working with Comcast. If there are any other services available in your area, choose of them before Comcast! Do not make the mistake of becoming one of their customers.", "Many times my internet goes out, disconnects or is very slow (I mean dial up 1990's slow). So I call up Comcast, they call back and the hours begin to tick by. The first Tier are people who I doubt completed High School. Listening Skills are lacking or not there. We then go to the second Tier, which hangs up before we start so I have to call again. There seems to a blaming of my Gateway which is constantly misnamed a \"Modem\" or \"Router.\" After 2 hours I reset everything myself including things that only somewhat advanced individuals should be able to figure it out. This is my fifth dealing with Comcast and their non-caring staff. I am looking into other avenues.", "Service shut off twice this year after not receiving the bills. Paid extra on my last bill and services were discontinued even after my payment was posted. I've tried to get to customer service through a phone number they provide, but keep getting transferred to a automated voice message that say I need to make a payment or I can't be assisted! This is it for me. I hate greedy monopolies that deliver poor customer service!", "I am very upset with Comcast and have been since August 7th. I signed up for online bill pay and forgot the next month that I had done that so my TV and Internet was cut off, that was okay and my fault, so I paid $170 to get it turned back on and here it is 8 days later and it's still off. I have to talked to 5 or 6 different people. One of which hung up on me, one said I just needed my box reset, another said that the $170 that came out of my bank account, that I paid isn't showing up in the system. I have called over and over and this problem still isn't resolved. My TV is still off. I'm still getting bills in the mail with it being off. I'm out almost $200 with no TV or Internet. Money that I could have used to cancel my ridiculous and inconvenient contract. I've never seen such an awful lack of communication. I'm very disappointed and upset with paying over $152 every month for one TV and internet, and now this.", "Really, Comcast? You are going to charge me $5 more per month because you had to process my new customer request, all because your website wouldn't accept my valid social security number? You guys are running a scam. No wonder everyone hates you.", "I cancelled my account with them on 8/22/15 due to their incompetence. Was told I would receive my final bill soon, which I did. The final bill was due by 9/23/15; no problem, I actually paid it in full on 9/25/15. I received a letter from a collection agency dated 9/17/15 that I needed to pay immediately for they now were handling my account/case, mind you this letter reached me on 9/26/15, yet dated 9/17. Idiots.\r\n\r\nComplete lack of common sense and customer service in regards to all their employees not to mention you cannot send a person to collections if they have not missed their due date! I would have given them a negative \"star\" if able to. I hope people realize sooner than later to go with other companies or simply \"unplug\". Needless to say I nor anyone I speak with will ever be their customer again, for I have yet to speak with someone who actually has something positive to say on their behalf. Good riddance.", "After about one hour of being transferred and disconnected, repeating same information about 8-10 times to live individuals and robotic voices I was able to get a service appointment to try and correct a chronic problem with inadequate wireless service in 1/2 of our home. We are paying for full service and only getting half. The company seems to have no problem wasting their customers time, they are not able to provide a fluid \"connection\" to the appropriate resource.", "Another rip-off move from Comcast/Xfinity now charging customer data service in blocks. This company should be sue by the government for rip-off business practices. Always squeezing customers wallets. Rip-off company.", "Comcast in Tucson is charging a base fee for their internet and limit the use to 350GB. ONCE you go over, they charge you $10 for each additional 50GB. NOBODY knows where all that data is going and/or coming from but they just keep charging. Internet from Comcast in Tucson, Arizona is being treated as if it was gasoline. There are NO extra charges, no extra effort to Comcast or by its employees. No reason for the cap of 350GB. They just do it. Dare you stream or share anything. They don't want you to use your smart TV. Dare you. These people are pirates and scumbags.

They again can't come up with proof that I have contract. WHY CAN'T I CANCEL COMCAST WITHOUT NO PENALTY IF I DON'T HAVE CONTRACT?", "From the first day, our experience with Comcast has been terrible. The first installer was hours late. He did a sloppy installation, leaving a giant coil of cable and not installing connectors correctly. The second technician said the first was a contractor and \"that happens\" - as if that should excuse it. Since then there have been non-stop problems with the set top boxes and the network/phone interface. Other Comcast Voice customers often can't hear our voice when we call. One of our four setup boxes malfunction or lock up on the average - approximately once per week. \r\n\r\nSolution from customer service rep every time we call in after waiting 10 to 20 minutes on hold - unplug, reboot, and wait 5 minutes for the defective box to restart. We have had the service for 9 months. It was bad as ever. I recently turned off the WiFi portion of the cable modem and installed an external unit that I bought because the Comcast WiFi kept going up and down all the time.

Tried to order over the phone. I received 2 remotes which was not even the correct address. Tried calling again. This time I received 1 remote. Still no box. Ok off to the local Comcast office. After half hour in line I finally received my box but found out they changed our billing address to our vacation home address. They can't fix in office. Back to the phone. Took the box home and tried to hook up. They now tell me there are no such numbers. They are because they are on the back of their box no receipt. No appointment in days. Someone help me of this poor pathetic company!", "I tried to reach Comcast customer support because my data usage has gone through the roof for no apparent reason. By phone: I called the support number on the website. Support said for data usage issues I should press 1. I pressed 1. Then I was offered two options that would not have helped me. I did nothing. Comcast hung up. I tried the same scenario again, with the same result. By phone again: This time I called and did not press 1. That led to more options, none of which related to my issue. I pressed nothing, and Comcast hung up. By chat: I got just a few lines into a chat, and the chat window froze. End of short discussion. By email: Then I chose the email option for support. Over 12 hours later, no response.\r\n\r\nBy chat again: So I tried chat again, just now, because this extreme data usage (287GB in just 12 days) will end up costing me big overage fees. This time I was able to have a conversation, be it at a slow pace. And I had to repeat my main question to finally get the answer that, \"No, there isn't a way to monitor hour-to-hour usage\" to try to troubleshoot what is causing the problem. At some point, I finally had to end the chat because I did not anticipate it taking so long. Before I had to leave the chat, I asked the support agent to send me any other suggestions or information. When I was able to return to the computer, the chat window was closed (no final message), and I have received no email, either.\r\n\r\nPriority zero: Comcast's customer service boss says we customers are priority one. I think he missed it by one digit. Now I have a choice to unplug internet until I find a solution or a new ISP...

My internet is 5000 ping.", "So, after having gone over Comcast's measly 300Gb data cap for a full year, I call up to cancel. I'm transferred to customer retention, where I explain my problem. Which is: I signed up for unlimited Internet. You changed the unlimited to limited because you don't like people streaming Netflix or downloading video games or you know, any of the 1000s of reasons people have for using the Internet. This wonderful customer retention specialist tells me he can give me a 500gb data cap and free HBO for a year. Wow. And just the month before I called to see about getting a higher package but was told that 300gb is the highest limit for residential customers. Whatever. Maybe they changed their mind. I took it. \r\n\r\nFirst month after that, no problems. Second month, my bill comes in and sure enough, I'm being charged for data overages. Called up Comcast again. 45 minute wait time. Just to be told that I was never signed up for any 500gb data cap plan, that the month where I wasn't charged for overages was a month where they had given me a \"pass\"...one of three months allotted for customers who go over their data allotment. I've been going over my data plan for two years straight. I used those three months up the first three months they began instituting data caps. Liars. That's all these people do.

Comcast cable has been out to my house so many times I can't remember. It took three or four Comcast repairmen to fix my phone. The last one one minute fixed because none of them know what they are doing. They need to be certified. Three times they told I need a new phone.

I purchased a 100mb/sec internet plan and have not received consistent service since going with Comcast in 2008.

Well, of course they aren't going to find a problem, because the problem is on their end. They oversell their servers and their data transmission lines become inundated and the flow is inhibited. Comcast relieves themselves of this responsibility because they use third party resources as a transfer medium. I am done with Comcast and will NEVER go back. I'll pay my 211.00 early termination fee, turn their box back in and be done.", "I have been having problems with Comcast on demand for a long time. Items scroll and literally choose themselves. I have looked at programs to watch, and it will buy the item just by clicking info on it. I let most of this go. I have even paid for programs I did not order on occasion because customer service is so difficult to deal with. \r\n\r\nLast evening I tried watching a video and it came up that I needed to contact CS for billing. This was midnight. If you call the number they give you on the screen, you are told it is not during business hours and you need to call back. If you go through the entire menu and push other areas, having to do with paying your bill, all of a sudden there is a live person to talk to. \r\n\r\nI will not make any politically incorrect statements but CS reps are unable to speak clearly. Do not know the language. The first person verified me quickly, told me I had reached my video credit for the month! And needed to put in for EXTRA video credit for me! He hung up on me after I was put on hold for 10 mins. I called back and as the rep who answered began I could hear this other person in the background talking! I told her what happened, and all of a sudden she said I was not a verified user on the account! I have always been for 12 years. She insisted I wasn't. \r\n\r\nI asked for a supervisor. He got on after 15 mins and said I wasn't a verified user. Both reps told me I could go fly a kite pretty much for all they care. Today, I called to find out what the issue was, and lo and behold, I am of course a verified user, and it seems there are tons of orders for a program we never ordered, but they insisted we did. Comcast used to be wonderful. It's horrible now.", "When we moved to another address we closed the Comcast account and our online access to our account was ceased. They didn't even send paper bills and we were charged with late payment unnecessarily. Not going to use Comcast services again in my life.", "I \"updated\" to Comcast blast about a month ago. Since then my WiFi is at a CRAWL and that is saying it nicely. There is no way I am getting the promised speed. Dial up was faster and of course, no answer from Comcast. As soon as I figure another service out this company is out for me. They should be sued for false advertisement.", "I've been with Comcast since 2011 now. We switched to them because they were the only way to get fast service in Central Florida, beyond 10 Mb/s. This is where I differ from a lot of reviews for this company. We've had service interruptions, but they are infrequent, and usually are being worked on by the time we call customer service. We have had to replace our modem twice, once because the wireless router failed, another time because lightning may have fried it. However getting a replacement was as simple as driving to their office, dropping off the old one, and picking up a new one after we call ahead. Then installation is just me putting in the new one and calling their tech support to send it an update and it's done. Our speed has universally been faster than advertised. Originally we had 15 mb/s, but we consistently rated at 25 mb/s on Speedtest.net even when picking an out of state source.\r\n\r\nWe later upgraded to 50 mb/s when it became available, and they gave us 65 mb/s. Just recently they upgraded the lines and gave us 75 mb/s for no charge, and now here's my latest speed test - 88.5 mb/s! We also picked up TV service through them recently, and we have seen a lower total bill plus fewer outages when compared to Dish. While their On Demand forces you to watch commercials by refusing to let you fast forward, it is extensive. In short the only two problems I have had with them is their new computer that directs customer service calls has a tendency to hang up, and their On Demand won't let you fast forward. The actual people are helpful, and their service is reliable. I know people complain about this company a lot, but at least in Lake County, Florida, their service is the best.", "You know I have had Comcast/Xfinity service forever and no matter where I moved to I never had a problem keeping my email address. In the last 7 yrs I have moved 3x and the last 2 addresses I lived at where I had created the email and then where I moved to I had no problem taking it w/ me but now this past May I had to move and the email was fine until this week. I received email up to 10:17 pm on Monday night. When I couldn't access my email on Tues I called Comcast. I verified my last 2 previous addresses that I lived at where I used this email and I was told by Wednesday night I would have my email transferred to my new acct.\r\n\r\nMind you it took 5 phones calls on Tues. but guess what it didn't happen on Wednesday so I called them again and again and again... Do you know since Tues morning I have been on the phone w/ Comcast for a total of 20 hrs. Finally tonight I called again at 513 pm which lasted for 2hrs 18 mins bc my email is still not transferred and guess what they are telling me that they have to call me tomorrow to verify my last 2 previous addresses again even though I have verified it every day since I've called on Tues... Jesus Christ doesn't even expect me to verify myself this much. Mind you for the last 3 days I have given them that info every time I spoke to or was transferred to someone... I believe I must've been transferred to 10 people including a supervisor tonight on this 2 hr 18 min phone call and can I tell you that my issue is still pending and not resolved... that's what they call great customer service.\r\n\r\nNow I have to wait til tomorrow, verify my last 2 addresses and then it will take 72 hrs to appear on my acct. It's a good thing I'm NOT dying or counting on an important email. Can I tell you that as soon as I can get out of this contract I am transferring my internet service to Verizon since I already have cell phone service w/ them and they don't treat their customers like this. I have had Verizon since 2002 so that's where I'll be taking my internet service. Before you decide to transfer to Comcast check out your options bc yea they are a large company but their customer service stinks. I work for Walmart and I know all about customer service and how to treat and take care of the customer. Sorry Comcast but you failed and receive a F in taking care of the customer.

I explained that I already had a modem that I would want to use. I told her that this was quite expensive and asked if she had something cheaper. She replied that the only other \"package\" she had was for $29.99 for 6mb/sec.

I called several times, and each time was told that a tech would be out there \"today between 9am and 5pm\". No one showed. This went on for 3 days. Finally I contacted the corporate office, and they got a tech out.\r\n\r\nFlash forward 3 weeks. I get a call from the Home Security sales division, promising me a \"bundle\" rate that would only be $10 more than I'm paying for internet, plus a free speed upgrade (as the upgraded speed is needed to run the system). GREAT! I took the deal. And then I got my first bill. HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN OVER CHARGES. And if I choose to cancel? $600 early termination fee. After unsuccessfully dealing with their local customer service, I had to get back on the phone with corporate, who finally agreed to let me out of the contract as their own recordings prove that the sales team misrepresented the terms. Here I am, months later, still trying to get a nearly $500 bill corrected. These guys are a bunch of clowns. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THEM.", "Comcast customer service is deplorable, complete with incompetent, rude and poorly-trained service reps. Instead of improving customer service to attract more customers, Comcast is now trying yet another dirty tactic to increase their revenues and make their customers even more dissatisfied and disgusted. There is no other company I can get ISP so I have no choice but to pay through the nose for Comcast's internet service which NEVER operates at the speed they claim.\r\n\r\nLast year I cancelled my cable TV service but continued with the internet service (since there is no other ISP in my area).Now, less than a year later, they've figured a new way to screw me - They just sent me a letter saying as of this month they are going to charge $10 per 50 GB of data I use over 300 GB per month. This is EXTORTIONATE! \r\n\r\nAccording to the new monitor they've installed, I already used 300 GB in the 1st week. So they offered me a way to avoid this $10 charge. I can pay them $30 a month more for unlimited data so now I'm paying $100 a month for just the internet. This is a 42% increase and I am at their mercy.

No matter how much money you pay to correct this - no matter how many calls you make to reset your modem (which I pay EXTRA for Comcast to provide) - NOTHING will make this situation better. \r\n\r\nThe internet connection is so pathetic I OFTEN cannot even download a browser connection. Think twice before paying for their services!

After several attempts to watch this pattern, I begin to feel that this is an internal policy that is not disclosed to the public. I am now prepared to start a class action lawsuit to settle my complaints and go public with my assumptions. I ask Comcast to step to the plate now before it gets really bad. I have lost rapport with my customers because I am unable to connect to the internet 75% of any day. I have lost money because of losing rapport. My business has suffered. No I don't have business class as I do not operate a large business, but I expect to be able to access service at least 75% of the time I am forced to pay for it.

We got Comcast for our internet (and sometimes cable and phone) whenever we were in an area that Comcast offered service. Every charge was explained beforehand. Any service issues were fixed within 3 days (usually within hours or even minutes). Customer service representatives were always easy-to-understand and helpful.

They are military-friendly. We have had to cut our contract short a few times due to unexpected (less than a month's notice) moves, and we were never charged a fee. They even offer services/bundles without a contract, so there is no cancellation fee.

What happened next shocked me when my speeds decreased to 3 mbps download speed. They told me that's what I was supposed to get, but they didn't know I was an I.T.

But when you clicked on it it always disappeared and internet deal started at $50-$60 a month and I did not have location devices on my computer while this was happening. And when I called the company asking for the $20 deal, they said there was no such promotion that had ever been going on. \r\n\r\nSo I stupidly still signed up with them and they gave me the wrong equipment. Not only that but they gave me two cable boxes. Which I had to return. They overcharged me three times on my bill. One of the times I spent 2 growling hours on the phone with a payment support agent who told me at the end of the phone call after he could not figure out for two hours what was going wrong with my bill. He said that he could not change it after all that time and that I would have to call back again tomorrow and have them fix the problem. \r\n\r\nAnd even when that wasn't happening they had their company's collectors calling me asking me to pay the bill days after it had been payed.

We have not had to deal with customer service the last 10 years. I have seen some bad reviews for company but not experienced it myself until now. The last two months we received a $650 and $860 bill. The data usage they are billing us is enormous. We have a Meraki wireless access point that tracks data usage and device usage. The discrepancy is enormous. The amount of data they are billing us for is 3000GB per month. We travel almost every weekend with kids sports and kids are in school during weekdays. I use internet below average and no streaming.\r\n\r\nMy husband has called customer service 8-times in the last 6 weeks. The case has been open 6 weeks and they have not contacted us once. No phone call or email stating they are working on resolution or providing insight on usage. NOTHING! We just got text stating we are 110% over usage and only 7-days into cycle. We have only been home 4 days of the last 7. We decided last week to cancel service but even that is impossible. They transfer you or hang up on you. Not one person can answer your questions. The customer service department truly cannot help you. This is very bad customer service and not acceptable for a company that you pay thousands of dollars. We have lost faith in Comcast and wonder is they are fraudulently billing customers.", "It is really so disheartening to know that your company can get away with this type of service and not have to have any accountability. I am expecting that you pull every last one of the calls that I have made today to hear each and every conversation with the 8 various people that we spoke with. How would you feel if you were sitting in a house that was 92 degrees? I found out a very good lesson today: You do not value me, a customer. \r\n\r\nMake sure to listen to the call with your agent, Chris, that took place at approximately 8:39. He is a winner. He didn't care about my issue at all. Thanks for being such a bad company with the most awful customer service that I have ever encountered. Take note to let everyone that I spoke with know about the 3/15 rule -- If a person receives great customer service they will tell 3 people. If the service is bad they tell 15. I will be telling way more than 15. This complaint will be posted on Facebook, Twitter, and any complaint website that I can find. You have treated me like a used, worn-out rag that has been thrown to the side. Shame on you.\r\n\r\nI made an appointment yesterday with Comcast because my thermostat which was installed by Comcast stopped working yesterday, After getting a low battery light I proceeded to change the batteries. After doing so the thermostat would not light up. I called Comcast yesterday and after going through their troubleshooting the representative told me that she had scheduled an appointment with Comcast for 09/08/2015 and that they would be at my home between the hours of 9-11 a.m. My husband stayed home for the day after canceling all of his appointments. He is an accountant. \r\n\r\nAt 8:30 a.m. a Comcast technician comes to my home and drops off a thermostat stating that an electrician would be by my home within the hour. At 1:00 p.m. my husband calls to inform me that the electrician never showed up and he had contacted Comcast who informed him that the call was noted as being resolved. He informed them that not only was it not resolved by on the hottest day of the year -- our home was a hot 91 degrees. He spoke with a woman by the name of Ashley. After speaking with my husband I too called Comcast and spoke with a gentleman by the name of Jonathan. I explained to him that my husband had been on the line with Ashley who stated that she had call a dispatch ticket in and stated that we should hear from someone within the hour. This was at 1:00 p.m. Since my husband had previously called Jonathan stated that we would hear from Comcast by 1:22 p.m. Of course that time came and went. \r\n\r\nI called Comcast back at 2:15 p.m. to advise that no one from Dispatch had contacted us. This time I spoke with Chris who stated that he was showing in his system that we were contacted and a electrician was en route to our home. Chris indicated again that Dispatch had advised us that they would be at our home. This was a flat out lie. No one from Comcast ever contacted our home. I called my husband to see if the electrician had arrived and he indicated he had not. I called Comcast yet again. By this time our home was a very hot 92 degrees. Side note: When the central air is controlled by a thermostat you have no cooling options. I spoke with a fourth person named Wally and demanded to speak with a supervisor because this was not acceptable. They stated they would be at my home to check on my thermostat. \r\n\r\nBetween the hours of 9-11 a technician drops off a thermostat and advises that the electrician will be at my home within the hour of his drop-off time which was 8:30 a.m. So at the latest the electrician should have been here at 10:00 a.m. It is now 8:03 p.m. We are still waiting on an electrician after being told at 6:15 by a supervisor named Bree that someone would be here. Why is it that we can call Comcast 6 times, get six different answers, and still be in a home with no air and a room temperature of 92 degrees? When did it become ok to falsify documents and state that you would be fulfilling an obligation and then not have to do it? Oh and then the kicker, we are told that we do not have an appointment for today -- it is tomorrow. \r\n\r\nIf all phone call documentation is pulled you will find in each call to Comcast we received different information. Not only did we receive different information but on the last call with Bree we were promised that an electrician would be at our home. Hmmmm, do you really think that someone will be at my home with the room temperature of 92 degrees at 8:06 p.m.? Please note that this is my formal complaint against this monopoly who obviously feels like my time is not of any importance. Not one phone call from them but trust me you will see that I phoned them 6 times. Really, what am I getting for my 375.00 plus dollars per month? What, you ask -- sub-par service that they should be ashamed of. \r\n\r\nThis is the worst company in the entire world. How can they get away with lying to me for an entire day and still not showing up to install a thermostat that they dropped off at my home at 8:30 this morning? This is not the first time that they have failed to deliver. Tell them to pull all call logs from the numerous times we have called since January of this year. Shame on you Comcast. You are greedy and obviously not a company interested in customer satisfaction. While it is 8:50 p.m. called Comcast for an ETA on when the electrician would be here tonight and we were just told that the electrician would not be at our home as someone has closed the ticket out. \r\n\r\nReally, FCC, in what world is it ok to just close out an escalated ticket and not notify a customer that has been waiting all day for an electrician that was promised by Bree. She assured us that someone would be at our home tonight and now we are being told that it will not happen and we will have to stay in a house with our pet and children that is 92 degrees. I hope that you really take action against this company. If you can not resolve my issue this information will be posted on all complaint boards so that others know that no one really cares.", "I was not home when the Comcast Tech comes to install internet service for my new house. I have an antenna cable connected from the outside box to a three-way splitter in the basement to my living room, family room and new bed room in the basement. I drew a diagram for my wife to give to the tech to follow. I wanted to make sure he just install a new cable for the internet to the living room. The tech cut my antenna connection outside, and all my connections in the basement, and took my splitter. Already filed a complaint and requested Comcast to fix that back in place.", "I tried contacting Comcast/Xfinity's service phone number. The person who answered was unable to help and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told the wait time was 10 minutes. In the meantime I asked to speak to someone in the United States. He said he would give me the number of someone the the US (in other words, Comcast outsources their employees). When I called, it was the same recording! I called the first number back, and asked the gentleman with the thick accent where he was located. He hung up on me!", "Service was disconnected for nonpayment.

They shut my service off too early, and then have not been able to get it back up and running effectively for some reason. They canceled my scheduled appointment for no reason, of which I set a month ago.

I was given an appointment of Thursday, Aug. 6th. They were a no show. I called and was given another appointment of 8/8 between 9-11 AM. No show.

I have just been getting the run around. I'm currently on hold for 28 minutes before getting an answer. Now all they say is \"please call back on the status\" and when I do call back the next person says the same. I'm guessing I'm just gonna keep getting charge until they finally feel like disconnecting. Comcast is not about their customers. I have been stuck with a little money problem and they are not compassionate nor understanding. I just keep getting charged and I'm getting no help at all. I warn everybody about Comcast scamming people.", "By far the worst internet service you can get. I was suppose to get the top speed and only certain times of day which is only like an hour will you get those top speeds. Additionally the service constantly has outages usually when you need the internet the most. THE WORST COMPANY ever who does nothing to make it right with customers. Now they are talking about and implementing in certain states Data Caps. So ridiculous, of course a terrible company like GE owns this terrible company. There are so many other alternative options for internet. Avoid signing up with Xfinity at all costs! You have been warned!

I ask again if it was going to be 0 balance, they told me again yes. On the same day of connecting the toll, me: 0 balance. Well when the bill came in it was for $528, so I have call - spend over seven hours on call and now they tell me it was a previous balance that was not paid. I ask them, still no help with this.

Also since installation the service has never fully worked. It will freeze up and black out. Some of these have been due to Comcast working in the area and others there has been no explanation. I have had to switch my modem out once already which has not fixed the problem of it not assigning the correct IP. I have tried several times to talk to someone using the 800 Comcast number but get bounced around departments or told that there is nothing they can do. \r\n\r\nI am at the point to disconnect all my services and find another option due to the utter lack of ownership of the problems I have had. I tried to have a technician come out and check the original install of the X1 and was told that they cannot schedule techs during an outage and that I would have to call back later.

Well, I got my first online billing (but no actual PDF of the bill) which was $154 not $110 - At the next opportunity I bundled up my equipment and went to my local office to cancel the tv service; however, I was told by the office rep that I only had 30 days to cancel, not 90 and I would have to pay $240 to cancel my service. She refused to cancel my television service but did take my equipment. Now I have no tv, but I'm still being billed because they are refusing to honor the 90 days or to cancel my service.

They put new cables in the ground. It's worse than dial up from the 90's. My double play bundle is 98.90. This is for one landline and slow internet with BLAST. \r\n\r\nMY sons tells me it's like the old party lines. They put too many households on the same line. I just called billing and told them I wasn't getting what I'm paying for and he switches me to tech. I had a tech guy out to the house last month. He walked around outside and again switched my channel. My speed went up for 24 hours only then back to the snail's pace. So much for false advertising, soliciting at your door, and getting help.

To avoid monthly modem fees I opted to buy modem on my own and Comcast rep suggested me to buy DOCSIS 3 modem before the technician visit for set up. On visit the technician suggested the Netgear modem Docsis 3 was not suitable and suggested me to buy another modem with Wifi networking. He suggested that I use their modem till I replace and then we can set up by phone call to service center.\r\n\r\nI bought a brand new Arris TG862G modem - same model as the one installed by Comcast technician. On setting up on phone Comcast was not able to get the modem work. They asked us to replace it again. We did that and called again.

Today they informed that there will be a $39 fee to visit as the modem is not owned by Comcast. After making us replace modem 3 times.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it is a deliberate trick by Comcast forcing us to use their modem for which they charge monthly. The customer service today were very rude. On asking them to connect to their supervisor, he flatly refused saying he know his job and there is no option but to pay - almost blackmailing us. As a new customer I am very disillusioned by Comcast, especially the way the customer reps talked today.

One representative noticed my GB were lower than they should be. When instructed to phone the Internet Customer Security Assurance Department, after holding for over an hour or more, I was informed that the rep was incorrect in telling me that my usage was capped incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAnd furthermore I was told that in my area, Comcast only offers a certain amount of 300 GB. On the online image of my account it stated 250 GB are what I'm presently receiving. I'm told by Comcast that my usage exceeds 1000 GB. But Comcast does not know why. I followed all Comcast steps and still my usage exceeds. This practice is unfair practices to customers. Comcast has the authority to charge overage fees but has no way of knowing how you are going over. Comcast should not charge until Comcast can show what exactly they are charging.", "I attempted to initiate service with Xfinity last week. It has taken me over 5 hours of phone calls to try to get service. I still do not have any. Initially, the customer service agent failed to take my e-mail, explain to me the new landline number, and took my last name incorrectly. I was supposed to receive a self install shipment of supplies. The shipment never came. Luckily, I called to check on the status. After being on hold for 25 minutes I was told that the order never took place. I waited another 25 minutes for a supervisor. The equipment was received the following day. I waited on hold 20 minutes to speak to an activation representative. Then waited another 25 minutes to be called back by the same rep. The activation was unsuccessful and I waited another 30 minutes to speak to a supervisor. \r\n\r\nThis has been followed by approximately another 75 minutes in phone calls to supervisors who attempt to give you their word that your issue will be resolved, but in reality, you are one of over 20 million customers whom they provide service to. Your business means nothing to this company. They have a sales and representative force that is poorly skilled and overwhelmed. It is truly sad to think that this is the state of customer service in 2015. I have been met with a litany of inexcusable, incompetent service thus far. \r\n\r\nWhat began as a simple phone call to start service has turned into the worst and most time consuming lack of customer service experience I have ever experienced. If there was another option in my area, I would rapidly flee to it. Any other provider, DirecTV, Dish, Time Warner, etc. would be a welcome choice. I DO NOT recommend Comcast Xfinity based on my statements above.

This government agency will punish Comcast or any other company trying to rip-off consumers. I already filed against Comcast and I had a very good results. Good luck everyone.", "After learning Comcast was the only internet company available in my area I was immediately distraught. I've followed consumer advocate groups as I am picky with who I do business with. I currently have/had DIRECTV which I am happy with but I just needed internet. Went to the Comcast office. They told me I can get 150 mbps internet for $54.99 a month with free cable at $0.00 and HBO. I was fully aware that it was up to me to cancel with 12 month or they will increase my bill automatically which I brought to the rep's attention and she confirmed. Installation would be $67.00. I knew after reading the disclaimer that was a mere estimated quote. Took time off work. Comcast comes out and explains to me what they need to to do get me internet. They would basically need to wire darn near my entire grid on my power line poles some distance away (3 power line poles crossing several private properties). \r\n\r\nI knew that wouldn't cost $67. No way, considering I'm a supervisor in the maintenance field. I know this game. I get an email about the appointment they made to execute the configuration in the neighborhood. I didn't have time to ask my neighbor's permission for Comcast to access their properties as that's just too much. Directv sent me a modem and it took me 30 mins. to install on my own. That all I wanted. So I call after hours (they claim they are 24 hour service hotline). After I finally get navigate the option to find downgrade or deactivate the automated system tells me something like \"The automated system is currently closed. Call back Mon-Fri 7 AM-7 PM\". Mind you my personal phone number was logged in to their automated system and they knew my account info based on my phone ID. \r\n\r\nI called while at work just hours before they were to install and each time I called I was immediately directed to a message stating \"The circuits are down. Please call again later\". I called 15 times repeatedly. And lucky me, I have a work phone. I immediately call and guess what, it connects. They didn't have that number on file. Eventually after repeatedly explaining I don't want their service as they continue to attend a reschedule the install, I tell the guy \"Have a good day.\" As he is hanging up he says \"Yeah whatever\". And that was my great escape.", "This is the worst cable company I've had the displeasure of dealing with and working for at one point.

Then told we got new boxes, not the ones we had. Got the bill and the new boxes were $10 each box, each month. Feel they were taking advantage of older people!!!!! Have had more problems then can count. Cable not working then phone not working. It's always something and they want to charge for everything!! Do NOT like or trust Comcast!!!!", "I arranged for a technician to evaluate for home security. I have an existing service. 4 separate technician visits suggested by Comcast could not figure out how to integrate my system. Canceled the attempted transfer. Comcast canceled all of my preexisting 2 year discounts on my 3 services without notice. They miscoded cancellation of security install in their system. They are billing me for services, tech visits, and equipment I never had. I have been on site at store twice. Received 2 different quotes on new costs. Billing not adjusted to reflect Comcast error. Billing us $622.28 for service I don't have. Additionally someone during this process in Comcast altered my social security number. I could not access services. I had to go into a store and present a social security card. No follow up on either issue from any management as was promised. My bill is due 8/13/15. I have been dealing with these errors since April when my number was altered.\r\n\r\nUpdated on 08/19/2015: I spoke with my escalation case manager yesterday afternoon to discuss issues listed above. In addition I noted additional charges on my online account information. The additional charges are unexplained at this time. It was noted that although these show up on my online account they do not show up on Comcast system. It was also explained that online charges, even if incorrect, do not disappear until the next billing cycle. The explanation for the 3 different quoted cost of the same services by 3 different representatives is this. There are different levels of representatives. Each level has a list of price quotes for services. This indicates that the pricing may be selected for your services by the level of the representative. Is this consistent and a fair practices way of charging customers?\r\n\r\nThe third topic was how my personal information could suddenly change in their system. The case manager stated he tried to recreate that scenario while we were on the phone and the system did not allow it to be done. We discussed this at length as there were inferences that perhaps somehow this was not done by Comcast at all. If not, does this attempt to shift blame back to me, the consumer, who does not have access unless done in person. I cited another person with a similar issue and was told he had never come across this before. It was documented in their system as to the date this change was first encountered. This allowed me to again stress that this was an unauthorized and unknown intrusion into my personal account information. I have requested further escalation to a management level. My case manager was unable to answer one question when the charges online are corrected.", "Being a Comcast faithful customer for a 1 year and a half they are not there for the customer. You can pay up 224.00 a month for a year but they will increase your plan without even notify on discounts. Comcast is not for the customer!!!

When I paid that 621.00 yes, I thought that covered the next month. Again, it's not like I did not pay!!! Now my bill is 726.00, that's more than what can afford to pay for a service that's not help, not for the customer and loves raping in the pockets!!! They won't even work with me on getting it down to something reasonable. Nobody has 462.00 to pay for cable yet alone 726.00. Robbery!!!", "I am so tired of Comcast. I had to move twice this summer. It was unfortunate but it's something I had to do. When I moved both times my bill was paid. However, when I go online to pay it for the next month there is a bill of $898.07 and there is no breakdown of how my bill actually amounted to that much. My bill is usually a little over $200 a month. So I called and chatted online to see what was going on. And they basically stated that the bill was created from my previous residence. I don't understand how that can be when I paid every month, how do I have a back payment of $420? They refuse to change the bill claiming that everything on my acct adds up to $898. Which is ridiculous because only Comcast can see the breakdown of my bill and I cannot see it on my end. I am so frustrated with this company. They just don't give a crap about the customer period.", "We have used Xfinity for years. Unfortunately, there are few alternatives. They change the bill amount at least three times a year, make us call, tell us they will fix it and then we call back next month. They say one thing and do another. Today when we called, \"We have no record that you previously called.\" This is common and very irritating. I would go with any other company if I could.", "Internet service off and on for last two months as of the 29th of June. No service for 3 days, July 2nd 2014. No realistic eta on resolution. IVR keeps stating a time frame of when services can be up and extending it. Reached out to local office tech supervisor in Lake County with no response. Reps are rude and disrespectful. When asking for a manager they state there is no one available. No one has answers or keeps you informed. Even for a compensation of credit you have to call to inform for it to be documented and then call back when the service is back up to get credit. I have no service and I am treated rudely and unfairly. I am told I have to deal with it and wait without knowing when I will have service. This is not an isolated issue. This is a power failure in my area for the last two months they have not been able to fix.", "I have service (if you can call it that) for approximately 2 weeks and in that time I have placed no less than 27 phone calls taking up so much time minute wise that has amounted to 21 hours of talk/wait time and STILL the issues continue. How did this all begin you ask? \r\n\r\nWell, in a far away kingdom called Chicago a fair and lovely Jewish American Princess ordered internet only service. The first evil stepsister told the lovely Ann(that would be me) to purchase my own modem rather than rent from the evil empire known as Comcast or Xfinity. As it turned, the modem was the wrong one so paid for shipping to and from and a restocking fee. The second time around was a repeat performance and then I followed the advice of the technician and guess what ?? Give up? That was also wrong. So the fair Ann incurred something in the neighborhood of $100 in all the aforementioned fees. \r\n\r\nAfter strenuously defending my position, I cut a deal whereby I would get 12 months of the company modem for no fee. Which is fine well and good. However in my small 500 square foot flat, I can only get service in the room in which the modem resides. Again I received 2 months of credit, bit free or not what good is half assed nonexistent service? I thought AT&T was bad and you can read my review for them on this site. It seems I might I have to find the lesser of the two evils. Oh and by the way, I do not have cable instead, I purchased the Amazon Fire Stick it plugs into my television which is less than five feet from my modem and still service is constantly interrupted. I have been trying to watch a documentary about the Hundred Years War. I feel that I have begun to reenact that event in real time or should I say reel time.", "I have had Comcast for 3 years and over time my internet cost has gone up tremendously. They continued to try to upsale us on cable and finally offered a deal where either our internet and phone would cost more than what we would pay for internet, phone, and cable so I took them up on this. Eventually the cable price went up more and we started at paying 45 dollars a month approximately and ended up around 120. I started getting suspicious as every time I called them they offered me different prices on different things. Finally I decided it was time to remove all services other than internet because the bill was just too high. Every time I said I wanted to remove a service they told me they could discount it and this is after many people had told me the rates they were offering were their lowest rates and I wouldn't find anything lower anywhere else. \r\n\r\nI realized that the bundled packages aren't actually accurate offers. They tell you how much the internet cost at a higher rate than what they actually will charge you. Then they tell you the phone is only 3 dollars more a month. But if you cancel packaged services it opens up other pricings they won't reveal to you until after your service is cancelled. And even then you have to wait days until that cancellation has taken effect before they reveal the newly available discounted price for single service package.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of all of this is that I was sold a 50 Mbps internet package without being told that in MN the maximum they can offer with that package is 25. They continually told me 50 is not available but then I find out that there is a 50 Mbps package (it is actually 105 but in MN the maximum they give for that package is 50). I didn't even want to start the conversation of requesting a refund for the difference in pricing between what they sold me and what they provided. I did eventually argue with a customer loyalty rep for a while about what pricing options they had available until she agreed to actually look and found the pricing option that I was referring to which she had insisted wasn't available.\r\n\r\nTheir business model is so similar to illegal drugs. Get them hooked on convenience and affordability and then raise the prices and introduce new services at discounted rates only to increase those rates dramatically as well. If you call to cancel your services one at a time you can get the best prices out of them. I am now getting double the internet speed for half the price I was paying. Again straight up misinforming customers about what they are purchasing is my biggest complaint and secondary is their purposeful taking advantage of people who just don't happen to call in to ask if their services are available at lower prices.", "I recently tried to switch to Comcast from AT&T to get faster internet speed. I ordered the self install kit which I was supposed to be able to plug in and login to activate with current service lines... That didn't work. I called to have it installed by one of their technicians; When I went to setup my Smart TV to connect to the WiFi it wouldn't connect. After spending 2 hours on the phone troubleshooting I was told it was the TV and I would need to contact their troubleshooting department. What kind of service can't connect the WiFi to a TV? \r\n\r\nI called to then cancel the service. I don't have the time to have them keep coming out to correct it when it should have been done at the time of install. After all that's said and done I was billed $125 for what... No service and a huge headache. Absolutely unbelievable. When I called to question why I was billed it was for the service (that I never had). I will not recommend Xfinity to anyone for any reason. AT&T has great customer service and they're reliable. I wish a little faster internet but I will take it any day over dealing with Comcast Xfinity ever again.", "I was on the phone with Comcast to cancel my internet service and the agent offered me another package that was bundled with HBO. The price offered on the phone was $44.99. After I got my bill, the price went to $49.99 before tax. When I received the bill, the price was $49.99 and after talking to them over the phone, no one took the blame and I am stuck with $49.99. Clearly the agents at Comcast are not train to help the customers but themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter I got the TV box and tried to activate the cable TV, it was not working. We called Comcast 4 times to fix the issue and they agreed to send someone to help us. But without advising us in advance, we were being charged $39.95 for the service that was supposed to be done over the phone. No agents could help us on the phone to activate the TV and we were supposed to pay for their lacking in knowledge? Very frustrating experience!\r\n\r\n", "Internet service got discontinued two times in last 2 weeks. They say every time that no service at your account. Tell me some other new address where service got transferred. First time after spending hours on call and visiting store and producing rental agreement to show address proof they said it will never happen again. And again after 2 weeks same thing happen again. When I called they have no history of last occurrence. They are not bothered and again ask me call again to get service transferred to my actual address. I have never shifted to any address and placed any request of transfer of service. But Xfinity keep giving this trouble and do not even bother about customer pain.", "I called Comcast/Xfinity in the middle of June regarding the slow speed of our internet service. The agent immediately said she would send someone out. SHE DID NOT TELL ME THERE WOULD BE A $70.00 CHARGE. The service person came and told me there wasn't anything he could do. And if I wanted faster speed I should try taking my laptop to the modem and sit next to it! I called to complain when I saw that there was a charge for that visit. The rep said she'd see if they would remove it because I wasn't informed of the charge beforehand. Never heard back. Called back today and was told they'd give me a $20.00 credit and that I'd have to pay the rest. My contract is up in December and I am choosing to end my service with them and get rid of Xfinity altogether! I'll use Roku for everything. Poor Comcast they don't make enough $$$???!!!\r\n", "I transferred my internet service by talking with a online representative. In the new apt, the internet just doesn't work. I called more than 5 times, spoke with different representatives and finally got an appointment. Not only no one showed up for no reason, I didn't receive any call from their technician to tell me at least the appointment was cancelled. The representative doesn't have contact information of the technician either. I've been waiting the whole afternoon during weekend! Horrible service!", "Customer placed on hold over 30 minutes waiting to talk to Comcast rep. Conversation interrupted frequently several times during conversation, each time dialed for reconnect, a long time waiting period (over 30 minutes). Recording voice process flawed \"limited choices to solution.\" Voice refers to Comcast rep. Additional waiting time - over 30 minutes waiting time again. There were (3) day wait before my problem was solved!! And service interrupted (3) days.", "Our internet, land phone and TV's were out on a Wednesday afternoon. I called Comcast and went through the usual routine which produced nothing. Was told I'd be called during the day for an appointment to have a tech come out. NO PHONE call from COMCAST! Day two, (Thursday) called Comcast again. Same answer, someone would call with a time and date. NO RESPONSE FROM COMCAST. DAY THREE Friday... called again... was told someone would come on Wednesday of next week!!! I said \"Absolutely not; we needed service before that!!\" Day FOUR Saturday... called again... was told maybe someone would come tomorrow (Monday) to check outside wiring, but not for sure. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS BUT COMCAST IS WORSE THAN AT&T. However, will not go back to either once my contract is up.", "On the line for five hours, trying to restore cable and internet which were not working when we arrived home this afternoon. Could only reach operators in the Philippines and could not get any help in the US. Transferred many times, left on hold, with no ability to solve our problems. We rely on the internet for our medical record work--we are both doctors. No help was given, and one gentleman I reached did suggest a temporary connection to xfinity hotspot, which is not a secure network. I was told that customer service would call back in 30 minutes. It is two hours later, and of course, no one has called. Why can't they have local US telephone numbers where a customer can call and receive appropriate service?\r\n\r\nI am lodging a complaint with the FCC, which I believe, will follow up with my concerns. What does a patient do who relies on the internet to send reports back to a doctor or hospital? This service is really an abomination, and the system is very broken. If I treated my patients this way, I wouldn't be in business. How do we reach this monopoly and change their customer service? They must have gotten this message before. What is the problem?", "My internet service has been unreliable for a majority of the 2 years since a move outside of AT&T range forced me back into Comcast Xfinity's monopoly. I'm on my 3rd rental modem, 3rd technician (2 no shows), and countless hours of phone calls. The customer service center seems designed to stall or aggravate you to hang up by having you repeat the same information many times, then keeping no account details when trying to reference previous calls, so you are always starting from scratch. Very frustrating to feel like Comcast is my only option and to be treated like they know it.", "I bought the 30-day access pass to Xfinity for $54.95. Most of the time, the wireless internet is slower than a dial up connection and often quits working entirely. It is close to not usable. Recently I went to a mall close by and there was an Xfinity stand with a representative. I told him the problem and he said something like \"oh yeah, to those one month subscriptions we give the slowest speed we have, 6 mbps.\" I should come see him and sign up for a cheaper and better subscription once this 30 day pass is expired, and I could also terminate it at any time. How can I subscribe to Xfinity, if this 30 day test is already as bad as it can be?", "I was a previous customer of Comcast about 5-6 years ago. In May of 2015 I contacted Comcast to inquire about internet service. I spoke via chat to a salesperson to get information. I never completed any order. I never activated any service. But on 09/01/15 I received a bill for 169.00. I contacted Comcast and they said I had to file a fraud complaint and police report because someone was fraudulently using my information. I had recently pulled a credit report and had no other unusual activity on my credit report. I believe the salesperson opened this account with my prior information. I have four email from Comcast that show I never completed any order. However I have to do all this work of filing these reports when Comcast most likely knows this was an inside job.", "So I was without internet for 4 days before I was able to finally schedule a service call (they said there was a general outage in my area and once that was fixed my internet service would be restored as well. It was not hence the need for a service call). I scheduled to take time off work so I could be home for the technician. After waiting 2 hours he never showed up. I called Comcast and they said my appt. was cancelled. They never notified me it was cancelled. I was very mad. They said they would send a guy out to check the pole and verify service was available. This would occur between 8am and 8pm the next day. If there were any questions they would call me. Well I had taken the day off so I thought maybe there was a chance it would get fixed. Around 6 that night I call and say that I'm still without internet service. They told me they cancelled the pole guy.\r\n\r\nHuh. Why? \"Oh you have a problem with your router and need a new one since we cannot contact it\". This state of affairs had been verified several times already which I believe was the reason for the pole guy to begin with. So I go to the Comcast store and return my \"defective\" cable box. While I'm there I get a text saying I can save myself 10 a month by buying a cable box. So I run over to a chain and grab a router and register MAC address with Comcast. Still no internet. Call Comcast again. \"Oh you will need a technician. Let's schedule you an appt.\" Well there were no slots available over the weekend so I schedule to take time off work again.\r\n\r\nI'm at home cleaning the carpet. I noticed a call. It is Comcast telling me the technician showed up but no one was home. Yes Comcast there were people there. So I get on the phone and demand they send him back. Twice they say they will call me back with an ETA. Both times they fail to call me back. I finally get a supervisor and he tells me they only work between 8 and 6 on weekdays. Well I'm not about to take more time off. So I schedule for the coming weekend. We will see if they show up, can fix the problem or if this is dragged out for a few more weeks.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes me about this encounter with Comcast is their 1st level employees are all reading from scripts. They just keep spouting the various scripts until you give up or do what they want. It really is like talking to machine that is responding to keywords to determine the script they will read from. When I compare this process to T-mobile's 1st level help, who I was talking with during the same time period since I needed to buy more data from them until Comcast fixed my internet service, it is just night and day. The T-mobile reps took action instead of trying to delay the need to make a commitment.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that stood out about Comcast is just how unconcerned they are about customers. They canceled a schedule appt. without contacting me and then after I went ballistic they offered me $15. Which I think is what they owed me for the number of days at that point I was without internet service. They did not care that I lost a total of 5 hours of work time (two 2 hour appointments and needing to leave 30 minute early for each appt.) and they repeatedly ignored my request for compensation for the lost work time. If they had shown up I'd be OK with taking time off. But they just blew me off and that shows a real lack of respect towards their customers. My goal now is to find an alternative service. And convince everyone I know how much better that alternative is to Comcast.", "I have been on the phone with various Comcast Reps from Customer Solutions Department to resolve the so call promotion end that wasn't indicated on the bill. They all have given me different dates of when and what notes they can review notes, but since I know this to be a problem I give them the dates from my notes. Their consistency that our promotion ran out without a reminder is not a good business practice. I am emailing the CEO of Comcast and I demand to be treated fairly. They should have no right to adjust anyone's bill without notifying the customer. \r\n\r\nWe went from paying $57 a month to $130-140 and then their explanation program expired, but no restitution for the 3 times reps have came out to figure out why our speed is so low and constantly buffers. The rep. then said \"you have the fastest internet we have.\" What A JOKE! It buffers to load a video. Comcast Xfinity is the worse provider and someone needs to come into Savannah and show them that quality over quantity is what consumers want. On hold with Daisy for almost an hour. Loretta (Customer Relations) and Latoyah (Customer Relations) happened to disconnect me without calling back after altogether 3 or more hours. Restating the same thing over and over. Company is full of excuses and lies!", "We have Comcast TV Internet and phone service. We went out of town for a week and we were Not getting calls forwarded to our cell phones. We drive around in a car wrapped in our business information. We got home and found out that our Internet TV and phone services have been shut off and switched to just basic TV only without our permission. Comcast even apologized and admitted to wrongdoing as per changing our services. Comcast gave us a free month of service and a $50 gift card with an apology note. We don't feel this is nearly enough because we lost unknown amounts of income due to this unauthorized change in service and loss. When customers would call our phone number it would say our phone number is not even in service so it made us look like we were not even in business.", "I have never experienced such bad customer service from a company. I moved to a new city wanted to get Internet Service. They talked me into getting Internet and Phone service as it was cheaper than getting the Internet alone. They told me someone could come out in a week and half. Pretty long time but ok. The technician Andrew came out and then told me they could not install as there was no line coming to the house. There is a concrete walkway in the backyard leading to the deck. So he said a contractor would have to come out and lay a line under the concrete. Then they could come out again.\r\n\r\nSo days passed no word from them. I call they say \"oh you are pending.\" We will have someone call you in 24hrs to make an appointment. She calls back later and says \"oh you need a special permit to lay that line it will take two more weeks.\" I tell her I really need the Internet for job related reasons. Candice says \"oh you can use Infinity wifi if you see it on your smart phone. I do so she sets me up with an ID and password.\"\r\n\r\nI get off the phone and try to connect. No luck. I then talk to Danielle who tries to help me connect. She has no luck so she sends me to a technician that has more knowledge than she does. She then passes me on to a hotspot expert. Well by now I can connect but it is only like 1 mbps. So basically you can do nothing with it. She says she can't help and sends me on to the next person. I say you aren't sending me back to the very beginning. Sure enough she does. As I am talking to this person and please realize I have to tell the whole story each time I talk to a new person. This person says you can't get wifi unless you have service set up. Grrr. All that time wasted with these people. As I am talking who is in my backyard but two Comcast guys to lay the line. What happened to needing a permit or two weeks?\r\n\r\nThey say the technician doesn't know what he is talking about you have a line all along. They say they will make a note about it. Just as I am getting ready to call them the next day there is a knock on the door. Three guys from Comcast are there to bury the line. What line it was buried long ago with the previous owners. No communication between the different departments. I call to them about the developments and when can they come out and connect the service in the house. They tell me it will take two weeks. I say you should give me faster service after all this hassle and a discount on my first month of service. They said \"oh we can't do that.\" I say let me talk to your supervisor. They say \"oh the supervisor is not here they will call you back in two hours.\" Oh by the way some technician cancelled my account so I have to start all over with a second credit check. Unbelievable. No one calls back.\r\n\r\nI call after I did not get a call back sounds like I have called Mexico with all the Spanish speaking going on. I explain the whole situation again Danny says \"Oh I have talked to the department and they will get you service tomorrow. They will call you around 10:30 am and be there by the end of the day at 6:30.\" I did talk to a supervisor then and he assured me as well that someone would come the next day. He said he could not give me a discount on my account because it is not active yet. I say why don't you give me a credit on the account. He says I have to talk to accounting. No one calls the next day or comes.\r\n\r\nI call to see what happened and they say \"oh they can't tell you a specific time I am going to write them up.\" I am now talking to an office in the Philippines. She says they will still have to keep the appointment 2 weeks from now but will try to fit me in sometime before that. So basically I would be on call for two weeks. Next day I call. Wow. They set me up with the Internet at a reasonable rate. Plus they came out the very next day. They came and Ken did an excellent job. Service is working great. Stay away from Comcast if you can.", "Where do I begin... (they deserve 0 stars) Here's my story: I placed my order and was told I'd receive it by Sept 3rd. That didn't happen, I contacted online chat to find that my order was cancelled. Why? Nobody knows. My inquiry was escalated to a new person who said she was looking into it and then closed the session without speaking to me. I called the customer service number (laughable) to see what was going on. I was sent to 3 people after the usual 30 min wait on hold... Nobody knew why my order was cancelled so it was reordered for a Saturday delivery 9/5.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, I get a call from this \"phone number\" 261-450 and left a message that my account needs to be validated. But she didn't say what company she was from, I had no way to redial the number as it doesn't exist. She didn't leave her name either. I only knew who it was because I recognized her voice. Once again I called... And waited... I spoke to a rep who told me that Saturday delivery was not possible and that she gave me wrong info. He set it up for rush delivery (Labor Day weekend) but I wouldn't get it until Tuesday.\r\n\r\nTuesday came and no order, I called. My stuff was supposed to arrive Wed but they couldn't tell me for sure. Ugh!!! Wed came and finally so did my stuff. After setting up my equipment and it didn't work - what a shock right? - I had to find a number to call because their instructions to \"activate\" the account only include a web address (ummmm I'm setting up my internet right?) If I don't have an android or an iPhone, I simply cannot activate my account. Sooooooo I went online - (yes whew I have an iPhone) to find a phone number which I did. Mind you this is the number specifically for activating the account.\r\n\r\nAfter validating who I was, the only option I was directed to was this - \"your account balance is zero.. To set up payment, please press 1\"... Omg I wasn't asking for my balance! I hung up and tried again. Same thing. This time I kept pressing zero in the hopes of getting an operator. After allllll of that, I'm told that I need to call back during normal business hours. So I found a new number to call the next day... The extremely under enthused rep was walking me thru install and said... Hold on please... He send me to tech support with no warning. The tech rep is trying to find out why my internet was not online. Then he asks the magical question, \"Did anyone come to your home to set up the service to your apartment?\" Grrrrrrr no!!\r\n\r\nThey were supposed to set that up the day that my order was placed. They tried to set me up for an appointment 8 days later. I said absolutely not. I am not willing to wait. I explained that after all of these phone calls and errors and waiting, if someone wasn't there that day, my account is closing. What next? They put me through to retention.\r\n\r\nThis supervisor promised a call back within 1/2 hour. I did get a call about 2 hours later saying that someone would be at my home on the 11th and I didn't have to be home. On the eve of the 11th, I called again. Surely there was a tech here that did the job and simply didn't notify me. I attempted to set up the equipment. Nope! Not working. This rep told me that he would find out what happened and call me back. Did he call me? Nope.\r\n\r\nSo I called someone else to cancel my order. An extremely condescending person named Mark told me that he would speak to me if I was so angry. Really? I enlightened him with reasoning. Especially that I told him that I wasn't directing my frustration at him. Moving on, he apologized about the service and said that he's never seen a rush service not be completed as it was escalated to urgent status. He said that it would be completed today the 12th. And I would hear back by 10 am.\r\n\r\nBy 12:30 I called customer service AGAIN! After reviewing my entire situation yet again, the rep told me she would get a manager to call me back as I told her that I must have someone call me immediately. 2 hours later, I missed her call from another non existing number. She told me to call her back at her number. I called. This was the message \"you've reached this number at non business hours, please call back\". Needless to say, I haven't heard from her. I called customer service yet again. I demanded my account be closed. Mind you that they won't tell you that they tell you that they'll see what they can do and promise a call back that doesn't come. This new rep told me that I'm scheduled for service on the 19th! I adamantly refused and demanded a manager. After waiting 10 minutes, she came back on to tell me that she'll connect me to a manager now... NO. I was sent back to customer service.\r\n\r\nMy blood was boiling. In the meantime, I received a call from my buddy Mark. You know, the one who told me that I would get a call by 10 am and that today work would be done. He now told me that I'm set up for the 19th. Needless to say I was furious!!! He was excruciatingly rude, condescending... And he hung up on me. I returned my stuff to the store. I was told it would be a 60 minute wait. I said absolutely not and demanded a manager. \"Pam\" came over and told me that I can leave my stuff there but no receipt. I said there's no way that I'm leaving my stuff with no receipt. She told me that she can't give me one. I was calling the police. Which I would never do normally ever but this was just insanity and waiting another hour was not happening. A very rude rep came over and to me basically \"too bad, if you don't want to wait, return it to UPS\".\r\n\r\nI headed right over to XFINITY and returned my stuff. I put my foot down and to Pam the supervisor that I'm not leaving without a receipt for my returned equipment which she refused to give me twice. I told her that I'm calling the police (which I'm not the type to do but this was all just too much). Finally, she agreed and gave me a receipt. Ps- the 4 people that came in after me were just as angry as I was. They also had serious complaints and zero tolerance when they were all told to wait an hour. What are the odds that in a 10 minute span, of the 5 customers that came in, all of us were furious at the non service received. Stay away from XFINITY / Comcast! Terrible terrible terrible!", "I just moved into my new home and contacted Comcast for internet and TV. Outdated equipment was delivered via mail - no install offered. Needed to hire video/audio tech at my expense. Buzz (very fast internet service) 0 - none existence. Internet is most of the time down. Spent about 3-4 hours with Comcast every day to fix problem. Special offer of $49 a month turned into a premium account for $99 a month with monthly billing of $249.00 for no service! Executive team all by the name Brianna, Rianna, Kesha., sounds familiar (I think they watch too much music videos), apologize bla bla bla bla but don't accomplish anything.", "I opened an account on the 9th September and my account got disconnected without my permissions on 21st September. After over 10 hours on the call and chat, nobody could figure out what happened and I was told the account is dead. So finally the resolution was that I open a new account which I did as of 24th September. I called later in that night to activate my modem, which I own, and they activated the service. When I wake up today I see that they activated the service on the account which was apparently disconnected on error. Now I have 2 accounts at the same location with the service I don't want.\r\n\r\nCancelling an account without my consent was breach in my privacy. Also, Xfinity/Comcast made a hard credit check without my consent which is another major breach of my privacy. Every time I talk to an agent they give some new info. If nothing happens soon, I will be forced to sue Comcast for mental harassment.\r\n", "They charged me EFT return fee. They cannot explain the reason. All they say is, \"Call your bank.\" My bank said there was not any charge from Comcast. I called 5-6 agents. They all said they can't see why there is a charge. I wasted 2-3 hours of my time.", "The worst service ever. Slow... slow... slow! You pay for high speed internet as they claim (75) mgs per second and the actual internet speed is 6 mps. Unprofessional techs, from installers to customer support. They are all just like their company. Garbage.", "Comcast originally called me to state \"they were updating their equipment.\" I needed to switch out my modem. They would mail it to me & I had to install it. I told them that I paid for my computer to be set up & I was not a tech, they should come out to switch out the modem. Comcast said they would charge me & so I refuse to have anything done. Next thing I know my internet is down & landline phone is down. I call & they tell me I need a new modem. I told them they need to install the modem without a charge. Comcast Rep say okay but would charge me only $20.00 for the installation but the Tech Visit. above my normal bill. I agreed & we set up an appointment for Saturday 9/16/15 from 8-10 am. \r\n\r\nI go to work & pick up my emails and find they sent me a bill for tech visit $39.95 plus the $20.00 installation. I called & spoke to another Rep, she makes an excuse that it is automatically generates a bill. She took off the $39.95. Saturday Tech never shows. I call & they tell me they cannot get in the gate but they never called me. I waited all day. I had given them my code to the gate so all they had to punch it in and it would ring to my cell since my landline phone was down. So they set another day up 9/26/15 Saturday & the time was 5-7 PM. Another no show. \r\n\r\nI wasted another Saturday waiting. And again they claimed they could not get in the gate. They had my cell number and gate code. I got my bill for September, called asked them to pro-rate the bill since I have no internet and no phone for two weeks. They said no, paid the whole bill and we will credit next month. I paid the bill. I tried calling corporate, left message for supervisors etc. but have had no help all. I call my landline phone and all it say that owner is not receiving incoming calls. Comcast does not care for their customers. All they want is their money. Buyer Beware!", "Spam filter is very ineffective. It took abut 25 minutes and three phone calls to report this to Comcast, due to their very poor phone menu system.", "I've been a Comcast Customer for over 8 years. Recently Comcast raised my monthly service to over $200 per month. I called to cancel in May and was sent to the \"recovery\" department. I was offered a deal so I would stay. A month later I called to cancel my service once more, as I was not completely satisfied with what I was offered. I was transferred to the \"recovery\" department again where I was given, what I can see today as, a \"too good to be true\" deal. The individual offered to lower my monthly to around $160 per month total and would increase my internet to 50mbps, plus phone. I really did not need the phone as I have a cellphone plan but the internet MBPS increase got my attention. And he promised that this rate will not increase for 2 years, and that I could cancel if not satisfied.\r\n\r\nI was in the middle of traveling for work so I decided to try it. He said I had to listen and accept something over the phone and then I would receive an email, so I did. This month my bill was $200 again and I could not believe it! I was very upset, so I called to cancel my service for cable but decided that I would keep my internet. I was told that I could cancel but because I am into a 2 year agreement I would have to pay $250 cancellation fee. I was speechless to say the least. I explained that I never signed anything to what I was asked if I had to go thru a phone acceptance. To make the story short, I was tricked into a 2 year contract I guess because I called so many times to cancel, that whoever I talked to decided to lock me in so I would not be able to call to cancel again.\r\n\r\nAfter trying to make them understand that I was tricked into this and what I was told, I finally gave up due to the Comcast representative lack of interest in resolving the issue. I feel so betrayed by the company I have given my loyalty and business for so long that I decided to cancel anyway and take the $250 hit. Unfortunately I need my internet and the only other ISP is not the best. So I told him I needed to keep my internet. I got hit a second time by Comcast telling me that because I am cancelling an agreement, the only internet plan I can get is 105 mbps for a cost of $114 plus fees and taxes. WOW! All I need is a maximum of 25 mbps but I cannot even get that from Comcast after I pay them the $250 unfair fee. \r\n\r\nThis company has changed a lot! I remember when they used to care about their Customers. Now they treat you well ONLY when you do not have a contract and when you do not call to complaint. The strength of a company that provides a service and/or a product is on their Customer service department. It is how well and effective they can resolve Customer situations, so you can keep your Customers. After searching the internet looking for answers, I just found out that Comcast is at the top of the list but for worst Customer service! I can see that... I guess Comcast has become so big and \"business\" like that people have just become a $ money icon for them. They do not care anymore... It looks like they do not mind the turn over as new Customers keep signing up every day now.", "Comcast is the worst business in this world. Don't EVER do business with them. We got their internet service (only because barely any other services are available in our area)... I was dreading it but we needed the internet. We set it up ourselves and it worked fine for the first 2 weeks. All the sudden it stopped working for no reason. We called someone to come out here and they didn't tell us it would cost a dime. After waiting a week for them to send someone out, my boyfriend waited at home all day from the 8am-11pm timeframe they gave us. They showed up an hour after; he obviously was out running errands after sitting all day waiting for them. We had to call to reschedule. Another 5 days went by before they could someone out for a second time. They ended up fixing the internet. However they screwed up our TV (DirecTV who is awesome!) and WE had to end up paying DirecTV to come out here to fix what Comcast screwed up. \r\n\r\nWe cancelled our service with Comcast before our month was even up and I was told by not one, but two different (surprisingly nice and helpful) customer service representatives that they were sorry for our trouble, \"it sounds terrible\" and that we wouldn't be charged anything for the service. What a joke. They ended up sending us to collections for $94.76. My boyfriend paid it so it wouldn't hurt his credit. I called and spoke with Comcast and THE RUDEST person was \"helping me\" and told me that it \"didn't matter what the other people had told me and this is the way it is.\" \r\n\r\nNow looking through the bill I'm also seeing some ** \"Failed CHSI Sik\" charge for $99.99. Which would mean what, exactly, Comcast?? The most **, shady company in the industry. We hate them so much that we literally would rather not have the internet at all than work with Comcast. And in this day in age you can imagine how tough that is. But I refuse to give that miserable place another penny. Don't ever do business with them. The only reason they are still in business is because there are not many other options out there. Just remember Comcast, Karma is a **. Can't wait to see you slowly fail.", "I was told I would be charged a $100 unreturned equipment fee upon cancelling my service with Comcast. The fee is for a cable box that I received as a part of my internet package. By the time I found out about this, I had moved out of my sublet and my landlord had thrown out the box. When I was given the box by an Xfinity employee, I was not told in any way that I had to return it or that there was a fee associated with it. In fact, I did not even need the box, as I did not have a tv inside my sublet. I have called customer services a few times to try to get the fee waived, but they were very dismissive and told me that nothing could be done about it. I would be okay with the fee if it had been verbally clear to be that the cable box was rental equipment and had to be returned, but since I wasn't, I feel incredibly scammed and disrespected as a customer.", "Trying to get services reactivated with Comcast after they in error deactivated services was a very disappointing/exasperating experience. Customer Satisfaction was not a priority or concern of agents. After dealing with Customer Solutions, Technical Solutions, Billing and devoting over 5 hours of time on the phone with the various departments and repeating numerous times the problem and account information, I have given up! Only two of the services within bundle are reactivated and phone services could not be restored due to outdated modem. Service Technician to reinstall a new modem couldn't come to home for over 1 week. Prior to Comcast deactivating service in error all services were working without issue. Comcast Xfinity does not provide satisfactory customer service.", "I am receiving two fees for installation totaling $60. After the installation, the operator told me one fee was for the truck to come to the house and one for hooking up the modem. We already had service hooked up to the house as the neighbors in our townhouse already have Comcast. This to me sounds like two fees for the same service. They didn't show up to the first appointment at all. We had to schedule another one. Making this a two and half week process. The hidden fees and poor customer service provided by Comcast is making me search for a better company. I do not recommend this company.", "When we moved to Maine last year we were not told about them having a data cap. It wasn't until over a year later when we somehow started going WAY over our data cap that we learned of it. I am very upset that we were not told about this when we ordered our service. I feel like we have been taken advantage of. We have no other option for internet in this area or cable for that matter and are stuck with this horrible company who thinks it's okay to lie to people and cheat them. I do not think we have gone over ever. I think it's their attempt to get more money from us. No added devices or more data use but somehow we went from using under 150 mb to over 300 mb? I don't think so. Seems fishy to me.", "I have a triple play service, and I use my phone and Wi-Fi for a work at home job. I don't understand why Comcast is running stating it is easy to move with Comcast when it is clearly untrue. I called on Thursday august 20th, asking to transfer my services. But I emphasized on the fact that I didn't want any problems with my line because I needed for work. On Sunday I wasted more than 3 hours on the phone with Comcast just so they can make it right. After speaking to more than 5 agents and doing lot of troubleshooting, it seemed to work. Now today, Monday august 24th, to my big surprise, I saw that I was assigned a new number. Therefore I am not able to work because I have to wait for them to get my old number back and after that I have to wait for another technician to remove all the features. This is not right. This is not acceptable for one of the biggest company. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't write this long review if it was the first time this problem occurred. Indeed, this is the second time. You can mark my words whenever I will get the opportunities to switch to another company, I will do it. Comcast failed to deliver on their promises. Why every time I called to make a small change to my services, there is a problem with my services. No I don't get it. There was only one instance I was late on my bill and it was just for one day. The agent had to lecture like a kid before waiving half of the fees. Every time you speak to an agent, be prepared for a different answer. This is not worthy. There is no company that treat me so poorly. \r\n\r\nCOMCAST deserves to be named the WORST COMPANY in the USA. As of right now (Monday August 24th 2015) I lost a whole day of work because of the incompetence and lack of care of Comcast, and unfortunately, I am still counting the hours that I will lose. They promised to call me back and I am still waiting. My situation is different. I need to work in order to pay my bills. My husband lost his job and I can't afford to put my kids in jeopardy. Back in February, I lost two days because of the same issue. I called to remove the tv from the triple package and the next day I found out I had a new number. ", "After a decade of non-stop issues with Comcast I finally decided to go with another company with a slower speed just to get away from them. The customer service has been a non-stop charade of rudeness and glaring ineptitude. There is a reason why there is an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to how bad a company this is. Each to their own, but you've been warned... Stay far away from Comcast!", "I just moved to Oregon and the ISP for some reason couldn't install the internet connection for 2 weeks... Even with the \"We'll put you on the appointment cancelation list\", assurance. So I noticed that the WIFI signal for XFINITY- WIFI was open and more importantly strong signal, so I connected and they gave the option to try for an hour and to purchase access. During that hour, with this connection, I was able to stream the NFL game and while not perfect... minor buffering issues, it provided that level of bandwidth. As soon as I purchased the service it became terrible. Literally just surfing the web was so painfully slow that it wasn't even functional. I can't stream an internet radio station because it holds a continuous \"buffering\" screen. I believe that this is the classic \"Bait and switch\"", "For the past couple months, I have been contacting Comcast regarding my overpriced Internet bill. They can never seem to get my bill correct even after numerous confirmations that they have made the changes in their system. At the end of the month, I am charge with an insane amount and on top of that, they provided TV service/equipment (which was stated, \"Free of charge\") and billed me $50 fee extra on top of the incorrect internet quote. Looks like Comcast needs to train their employees better and take the time to invest in taking a step back and reviewing the numerous complaints that many others have expressed to know what it takes to provide customers with excellent service. I am happy to close my account and look elsewhere since a simple communication and problem can easily be resolve even by a 5 year old.", "I have been leaving resumes/filling out applications daily where I could find employment. It's been over 5 months already, stressful - but trying to keep a positive outlook. Suddenly my e-mail thru Comcast stops working. I start off following directions to \"get new password\". The entire online system takes me thru \"loops\" back to the beginning 3 times, frustrating. So I have to phone them, the answering system, places me in 2 different loops on two different subject matters due to the fact I was trying to get the correct department. When I finally get the correct department, and I explain to the technician what happened concerning the phone loops. He goes into of an explanation of \"how the phone system works...\" (but it doesn't work that way, maybe as a customer they should try it, so they can find out what the customer is dealing with). \r\n\r\nI continue my contact Comcast; the technician stated, they disconnected my e-mail due to me not having service. But I did have service and it was in good standing. I had no warning, all my resume/job connections via my e-mail were gone. I entered slight panic mode, I felt I was violated. Something that was mine, taken. I do pay for service monthly phone and internet to Comcast for a few years now. They said it would take 3-7 days to fix. The technician stated very emphatically \"it was the customers fault it happened.\" \"Excuse me? How is that?\" \"Well the last person who had that e-mail address canceled the account.\" \"No, he got married to me, moved in, and I had Comcast/Xfinity, what is the problem.\" \"See I told you, it was customer's fault.\"\r\n\r\nSo we have been using this e-mail address on nearly everything we had for over 2 years. They disconnected it with no notice, no empathetic apology, just pointing at us. So all I could do was wait. 3 days later I call again (same loop with the phone system). This time the salesperson said, he didn't see an explanation of any previous phone calls on my account. When I then explained to him what happened, he very calmly said (without any typing) \"Oh, they are working on resolving the issue.\" I hesitated and asked, \"how can you say they are resolving it, when you just said you didn't see anything on my account?\" Slight sarcasm, \"Well ma'am, I see it now,\" then a firmer comment as he was frustrated with me, \"They are resolving the issue.\" \r\n\r\nAt this point I had my doubts, so I asked, \"do they have a solution in which they are working on? Or will I get this same comment 6 months from now? Working on it could take 6 months?\" \"Ma'am, they are working on a resolution, that's all I can say.\" Once again with sarcasm. Disregardful of a human being on the other side of an e-mail address (despite the fact I was a paying customer). Loops online. Loops on answering system. Accusatory to a customer, not really best practice for a loyal paying customer. They actually went up $15 on my bill for the next months service (not due to late fees etc), just went up.\r\n\r\nWhen looking for a job, all need e-mail accounts and passwords on job sites, and many on applications which need to be verified/confirmed thru the e-mail account. This put my job searching to a halt, and if anyone contacted me thru e-mail for a job will probably figure I blew them off. Thank you Comcast. While I was updating passwords etc, and feeling the same frustrations speaking with operators and different places of business, none of them made me feel as insignificant as Comcast. Some were quite pleasant and gave me a hope for humanity again. I contacted other internet providers. Oh so many. They are none which service in my area, other than Xfinity. I figure I have no choice. Then again, I do. No internet or phone service for me. Thank you.", "Comcast internet service is unreliable. The internet speed is not what they claimed to be. I am only getting 3-5 mbps most of the time and always froze my internet connection. When you call their executive customer service, the calls get dropped the moment you complained about the problem. No more Comcast for me, sorry this is not the kind of service I should be getting from a customer who pays on time.", "Comcast had triple play for about 8 years. Never got a bill over 140 monthly plus tax. Was happy with everything until early this year (2015) when bill triple because Comcast put a cap on WiFi without customer knowing. I have to let my cable go. Can't afford it anymore. Very unsatisfied customer now. When Comcast take the cap off WiFi, will return again.", "I've been dealing with Comcast for 3 years now. I have watched commercials that brag about their wonderful service and their great, wonderful customer service. I don't find their service to be wonderful or great. I don't find them to be a step ahead of the rest, they're actually a step behind the rest to using cable and routers. Representatives are rude and you get disconnected if you're one day late even after 3 years. My thought is to just go back to DIRECTV because I never had a single problem and it costs a third of the price that Comcast has cost me. I feel like Comcast is a big fat waste of money and time.", "Never getting Comcast again!!! They suckered me into a two year contract because I thought they were giving me a good deal, ended up paying over $220 a month for their services. Now I'm canceling and I have returned equipment over three weeks ago and I get another bill and I get charged yet another month!!! I have been calling numerous amount of times and no luck. I have just been getting the run around. I'm currently on hold for 28 minutes before getting an answer. Now all they say is \"please call back on the status\" and when I do call back the next person says the same. I'm guessing I'm just gonna keep getting charge until they finally feel like disconnecting. Comcast is not about their customers. I have been stuck with a little money problem and they are not compassionate nor understanding. I just keep getting charged and I'm getting no help at all. I warn everybody about Comcast scamming people.", "Sales rep said high speed internet was included in the package I just signed up for. I discovered I was being charged for it on the bill. I called Comcast/Xfinity and they said it wasn't included and wouldn't make it right. I then had them take the high speed internet off and they said they would credit my bill and it would show up in 24 hours and I wouldn't need to pay it. I check a few days later and the charges are still on my account. I got on a chat call with a rep and told them my story and they told me they wouldn't make it right either and that it was still on my bill and I would maybe see it on my next bill as a credit. Not a very customer friendly company and don't back up what their sales reps promise.", "My internet goes on and off or from a strong signal to a weak one. COMCAST has their phone system fixed so that it is impossible to speak to a person. When you choose that option the phone disconnects. I am so tired of it, I am now in the process of setting up my service for phone and internet and TV with someone else. I will not even bother to call them again. Another thing is COMCAST every year raises their prices at the minimum of 5 dollars a month and raises the lease on their boxes or modems. It is pure corporate greed and disregard to its paying customers.", "I started with Comcast 2 years ago and when I started I was paying $89/mo. Before the first year was up I moved and got another good deal to change addresses. After That year my bill jumped to $160. I called to see about changing plans and they gave me BS deals that were a lot less service for only a few bucks cheaper. Turns out once you are a customer then they no longer care about you and will not offer you anything better. Only new customers get better service rates. Only problem is they are the only ones that service internet in my area. Such a scam.", "Comcast has one of the worst customer service telephone service in the business. It takes at least 10-15 min to get to speak to a live representative, after that, repetitive confirmation questions which apparently are not saved in the system after being transferred numerous times to get to the right person. After I finally reached an X1 service representative, he dropped my call and I had to wait another 10-15 min to get another representative. Finally, Dave did help me to resolve my question (log in ID and password to access X1 on iPad), but could not find any record of my previous communication with the prior X1 representative who dropped my call after confirming my identity and account, then putting me on hold.\r\n\r\nOverall, 40 min of my life wasted, something that could have been accomplished in less than 10 min. This is not just one occasion, this is EVERY time Comcast Customer Service is contacted. They are verbally polite, but excessively so, and more importantly, are either incompetent or do not care. Often times in my experience, this may be rooted in not being taken care of well by the company themselves.\r\n\r\nIf Comcast wants to keep me and thousand of others as customers, telephone customer service system needs to be corrected for automated system redundancies and incomplete options, inefficiencies, lack of accountability and a major waste of time Comcast is repetitively putting its customers through. Look at other reviews. This is not an isolated incident. This is a systemic problem!", "We have been stuck in the phone wheel of death for 2-3 hours on three occasions in last three months trying to get resolution. They send people out who then have no idea what they are doing. They get on phone with supervisors, look for direction, spend hours in my home wasting our time then tell me someone will call me the next day to reschedule. On the last and fourth such visit, we were scheduled to have the whole house rewired as we get 3-5 mbs and pay for 100! \r\n\r\nSupervisor Alex comes out then tells me they were not scheduled for rewiring, we were scheduled for troubleshooting. I lose it of course and after 1 hour on phone with numerous people, he says they will have to reschedule. Says he will not leave the property until it is resolved and rescheduled. I leave and go to work as he is to call my cell phone. He never calls and of course leaves. I am left back at square one. I am at my wits end. I have a house full of teenagers and need to often work from home but with spotty internet I pay a fortune for, we are out of options.", "Every time you call Comcast you have to suffer through minutes of pushing buttons, no one is ever available with whom to speak. You get run through the mill with advertisements and requests to spend even more than you are currently charging for monthly services. When you get someone on the telephone most staff is out of country and frequently cannot communicate unless they read pages of information printed in front of them. Frequently, you are transferred to a second individual and often the phone connection is disconnected. Thus, one has to start all over with listening to the worse automated information doing nothing but constantly aggravating you. I believe it is your subconscious goal to aggravate all of your customers since you have such a monopoly. Any other corporation has to be better than you. Scale of 1 to 10, you rank with everyone who has you in a minus category lower than one.", "I just checked and of course, the Wi-Fi has been enabled again, just as I thought Comcast is purposely enabling the WIFI Hotspot after I log out of my account. I know this because I use a app called Wi-Fi Analyzer and it shows a Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot broadcasting signal. The ID numbers are almost identical to mine (only the 2nd number is different - EX: Mine is E8 / Xfinity WIFI Hotspot is E6) to prove that it is my gateway broadcasting the signal, I unplugged the gateway and yes both signals disappeared and reappeared when I plugged it back in. This is clear proof that Comcast is purposely lying to me and all it's customers - letting them think they can shut down the Free WIFI Hotspot, knowing that it will be automatically turned on when they log out of their accounts. \r\n\r\nIt's bad enough that I pay a high bill for my Internet, plus the fact that Comcast charges me a Gateway Rental Fee and you lie to your customers about this. I guess Comcast doesn't care that they leave their customers open to Hackers and ID thieves. Of course, they will claim it's totally safe, but any decent hacker can get around the firmware & software and hack a router/gateway. Nothing is fool proof.", "We got Comcast internet services over a month ago and from the day we order till this day it has been a mess! At first the company confirmed a day of connection, they did not show up! Then the technician left the cable unburied in the back yard and said that in one week the workers would come to buried it - it has been over a month and they never showed up for that. What they did was to connect another cable and left the rest of the roll hanging on the wall for about three weeks now. They did not call to say that they were coming and much less what they would do. So we have two cables in the back yard, one hanging and other loose on the ground and we have called them many times and the work never got done! \r\n\r\nThe customer services is one of the worse of entire world. If you are lucky you get someone on the phone located in US otherwise you will get someone in Philippines as I spoke with three so called \"supervisors\" from there and they did not do anything at all! :( The bill arrives super fast but the work to be completed is far to be fast! We are so very disappointed and went through so much aggravation in such a short period of time with this company already that we are looking to sign up with a better one! Comcast should closed their doors, they do not have structure to operate as a decent business and much less to have lots of customers so unhappy!", "I called COMCAST to get a Double Play Bundle Special. The advertisement baits you by quoting $89.00 for a double play. My final price was $133 if I wanted internet speed that actually worked. I was then quoted $79.00 for the double play bundle before all of the extras but I had to sign a two year contract. I think that it is next to impossible to get cable/internet for the advertised $79.00. Each month my bill has increased. A year later my bill is $195.00!! Each month they increase a different item on the bill. Sometimes they will actually overcharge for the number of set-top boxes that you have. It is next to impossible to get any item changed. If you get one price adjusted, they will overcharge you on a different section of the bill. \r\n\r\nThe customer service representative who you initially speak with will promise anything to get you to sign up, then Comcast states that the charges are not part of the actual contract therefore, they can change them. I was told recently by customer service that the $79.00 was a limited offer discount, but that was the price I was quoted to sign up not a limited time special. When I called Customer Service (in the Philippines), I am told by the supervisor Al, \"We can always change the price whenever needed\". \r\n\r\nI signed a two year contract with the understanding that I was guaranteed the same price for two years. I might as well be speaking with a robot or a computer as someone in a call center who has no ability to assist me. If you are quoted one price to get you to signed the contract and you are charged another price- I believe it is called BAIT AND SWITCH which is a deceptive advertising practice, fraud, and it is a violation of consumer law.

After multiple calls with Customer Service I was finally quoted a double play package at a reduced rate. I called the day before my installation to confirm the channels I was suppose to get. After the guy hooked everything up and left I realized I wasn't getting all the channels so I called customer service.

I was also told by the Supervisor that they are not responsible for what the consumer are sold/told by customer service and they wouldn't honor it.\r\n\r\nThey pulled the calls but after the first call he was bored and offered me a $40.00 credit for 3 months but that would only be for the new upgraded package.

I turned in all of my Comcast equipment at the Comcast Service Center in Factoria, WA. I was badgered for nearly an hour about transferring my account to Texas even though Comcast doesn't provide service to my Texas address. Comcast continued to bill me for service, threatening to turn me over to collection if I didn't pay the July and August bill. They agreed that I had turned in the equipment but had not requested service termination.\r\n\r\nAfter several conversations with various customer service reps and being told that I would have to pay the late fee even though I didn't owe the bill, I gave up. I guess they came to their senses because they quit billing me. On October 25, I attempted to log into my email account and received an \"ACCESS NOT AUTHORIZED\" message. I called customer service and a very rude representative explained that 30 days after termination of service, all email service was terminated. He said that I should check the terms of service that I agreed to when I signed up for my email account (that was in 1995!). I explained that my business depended on that email and asked if I could at least get access long enough to transfer my contacts and my recent emails. I was told that all records had already been destroyed. That's difficult to believe since I had accessed my email the previous day.\r\n\r\nI requested to speak to a supervisor and was told that \"it wouldn't do me any good\". However I insisted and after a great deal of resistance, and 25 minutes on hold, someone who claimed to be a customer service supervisor answered and in very poor broken English, questioned me about my problem. She then stated that she needed to do further research and asked if she could call me back in just a few minutes. At my suggestion, not hers, she took my number, repeated it back and hung up. No call back was ever received.", "AS the only high-speed internet provider in my area I am forced to do business with Comcast (DBA Xfinity). They are a complete nightmare to do business with. I had an installation performed on October the 21, 2015; They left the cable laying on top of my lawn, telling me it would be buried within a week. More than a month later I am still spending 30 minutes to an hour a week on hold with their customer service trying to get them to come bury the cable (a service I already paid for with the installation fee). Every time I call they give me a ticket number and tell me I will receive a call the next day to schedule the service. Each time I get a call telling me the cable will be buried in about 5 days as still the cable sits there.\r\n\r\nI am now getting nasty notes from my HOA about the cable so today I asked for a supervisor to speak with. I have been waiting on hold for more than half an hour now... Still no supervisor. In my experience this company has zero sense of pride or accountability. Every representative I have spoken to during the last month gives the impression that I am somehow at fault for their continuing failure to do what they have been paid to do.", "Before I complain about the Comcast internet service, I have to mention this. I am a Korean and had the fastest internet service in my country with low monthly payment. AND there is no limitation for the usage. Yesterday night, one message was popped up on my computer. It said my data usage reached almost 90% of my plan. I was shocked and angry. Data usage limitation? I haven't heard about that before. So I called Comcast internet customer service. The customer representative said there is no data usage limitation on internet. She added that if the message keep popping up then contact Comcast internet security service. \r\n\r\nAll of sudden, she said since I have been their customer almost 9 years she recommended to change the service program, as a bundle of internet and cable TV for $59. It was attractive but I said I was OK with my program now. But she kept pushing me to have the new bundle. So I said since I was not sure if I stayed in the same place in next year, I did not like to have one. But she said there should be no early termination and even if so they could handle it. I didn't and don't believe her words. But that was not an issue. So, in this morning, I felt uncomfortable about the message again, and called Comcast again. I asked about the data cap and the customer service representative said there is none. So I talked about the message but she said there is no data limitation for home internet service. I asked her to transfer my call to her manager. Then, she transferred my call to security department! \r\n\r\nThe security department guy said they could not help me because I am not the account holder. I explained that I was calling for my wife and I am the one who pay the monthly payment. Then they explained me that there IS data cap/limitation. What a bummer... I argued that I did not sign on the contract under data limitation. He said it was implemented. So I argued that the Comcast only shows customer two different speed internet service without explaining data cap. And he said normal speed internet has cap of 250 GB and high-speed internet was 350 GB limitation. I haven't hear of that. I quickly searched about that while I was on the phone and found only a handful cities in the U.S. have the cap, and Tucson AZ is one of them. That guy explained me that since I normally used under 300 GB except only one month I did not have to worry about the data cap and if I use more than that, they are going to charge 50 GB for $10 more.\r\n\r\nI argued that I had no memory to read that policy through their official letter and I had no reason to agree with the data cap because I signed the contract back in 2006. And I asked him whether there was another choice or different program. He said he could transfer my call to their sales department. But he transferred me to data usage department. I had to explain the same subject over and over again. The technician did not know what to do with my question. He did not even know there is a limitation. He said he could check the internet connection. So I said I was not talking about internet connection. Then he transferred my call to sales department. The sales department guy said there is no limitation again! And all of sudden she said there is. \r\n\r\nI told her I did not like to have limitation on internet usage. She said then I have to choose $350 internet service. And she added that was the only option, otherwise I have to pay $78 per month plus over usage fee for every 50 GB with $10. I just wasted my 2 and half hours with useless call and customer service. There was no way I could get help from them. Like you see, half of them didn't know their internet service has data usage limitation. Other half did know but couldn't handle my complaint. I did not sign up for the stupid internet data cap. If that service is like other mobile phone service, I cannot help accepting it (Verizon forced me to resign contract from unlimited data plan to 7 GB limited data family plan. Otherwise I could not change my broken Samsung smartphone) BUT, the home internet service is supposed to be unlimited. Internet itself is democratic and the providers are not.\r\n\r\nOne comment the security department guy told me was like this, \"There is a limitation, but even if there is, we do not disconnect your internet service. However the fee on your billing reflects the usage, 50 GB for $10. That's why the customer representative said there is no limitation.\" For my entire life I haven't heard that kind of logic. Only word I can think of the event is GREEDY BASTARD. I like to join a class action if there is active one now.", "I had internet and home security installed a few months ago. I was not told that I had a data limit. When I discovered I had a limit I was told I could check my usage online. This was false. I cannot get anything but an error message telling me my equipment cannot be loaded. I tried 3 times to get help. The last time I was told I would have to call for my data usage. After I got finished speaking to tech support my home alarm started going off. Xfinity says it is not going off. I can only assume I am being punished for having an issue. I would not suggest Xfinity Home or Comcast internet to anyone. The customer support is an overseas call center that bounces you from one person to the next and they never solve the problem. I am now stuck in a 2 year contract with internet I can't use for fear of incurring fees and a home alarm that keeps going off.", "I have been calling Comcast out to my house for almost a year now. They have been out over 6 times. I was told to upgrade for the 50 Mbps and lucky at some points getting about 10. Now since last time a month ago they replaced the modem again and now only getting to 2 Mbps. Now they said I have been paying for 50 Mbps but not having the codes setup for it. Working with them to get fix again and trying to get some sort of credit. Each time I ask for a credit it's amazing how in the peak of the day when I call their sales system is down. But, when call them back to ask to add a package to my account that is working...", "They promise 100 m download for their blast service. My computer NEVER got over 72 and during peak hours it dwindled down to 15 m on the speed test. They had 101 excuses for this including blaming my laptop. No credit given for service I was not getting. They do a transfer of service and move my billing cycle 2 weeks earlier. This caused a $100.00 discrepancy in my normal monthly bill. Tried to explain what happened but they cannot do simple math and justified my bill as accurate even though I was getting ripped off for 2 weeks of service for them changing the billing cycle and them charging a month in advance. FIOS is not in my area but wish it was. My mother has FIOS and it is 100X better than Comcast with 100X better customer service. Don't be another Comcast victim, get FIOS if all possible.", "I don't know from where to begin, but briefly I advice all users not to deal with Xfinity - Comcast Internet provider if you wish to save your time, nerves, health and money... It is the worst I have ever dealt with and the worst service - internet not stable, it fluctuate, the Billing is ALWAYS ALWAYS HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD. They seem to be helpful and supportive but in fact it's nothing but a cheat just to so called, offer support that does not solve any issue. I came to the point that I would even stay without internet just for the sake of not using what they call internet service. I recommend everyone not to use XFINITY- COMCAST!! IT IS JUST SO DISAPPOINTING.\r\n", "Similar to other reviews on this site, Comcast Xfinity offered my husband a great introductory price for one year of internet service. Yet, they never charged that price. The first month, they overcharged more than double. When he complained about the overcharge and mentioned the introductory offer, they said \"that's only for new customers.\" He explained he was a new customer and they said since he had an account, he wasn't. He argued and got the rep to agree to adjust the price. \r\n\r\nRepeat the above for the next FOUR months. Every single month a different \"customer service\" rep said they would adjust the charge and the plan on record but they never did. On top of that there is no way to email the company. In fact one customer service rep said they are not allowed to email customers. I guess they don't want to leave a paper trail... all conversations over the phone leaves deniability over what was said. I am convinced that this is their business model. Quote one price and then charge another until the customer gives up and pays it or goes elsewhere (which is not an option for some areas of the country). I would leave NEGATIVE stars if I could.", "I am sadly upset with lie after lie from Customer Services Agents and Supervisors. On September 20, I spoke with a female agent, who offered me a package of internet service plus Latino TV for $ 34.99 (no signed contract), and she stated that this amount will be kept for 24 months. I was driving and could not finish my deal with that female agent.\r\n\r\nOn September 21, about 1:00 PM, I spoke with a male agent, who again offered me a 24 months no contract 3 GB internet service plus 119 Latino TV, plus many English Channels, including all Nickelodeon, all Disney Channels, Food Network and GSN (Games Show Network) Channel plus 2 HD boxes for $ 34.99 with an special technician, who will come to my house to install everything for extra $ 5.00 dollars. The male agent scheduled me for a technician visit for September 23, and said that the technician will bring the 2 HD boxes, and then he complimented: \"on September 22, you will receive a phone call from the technician to inform you what time on September 23 he or she will be there.\"\r\n\r\nLast night (September 22) after no phone call received from the technician, I called Comcast Customer Service, and spoke with a Supervisor, who apologized about the 2 agents lies, since Comcast has not 24 months agreement with no one. Also, he informed me that no appointment was made, no 2 HD boxes were added, no special channels; but he said that he will be add the extra box (since the liar male (and female too) agents offered 2 HD boxes), and also he made the appointment for today September 23, between 1:00 to 3:00 PM.\r\n\r\nToday at 2:45 PM, I called Comcast Customer Service, and a female agent said, that the technician will be in my home about 3:20 PM. I called again at 4 PM, and spoke with an agent named Luis, who asked for my phone number since his supervisor will call me immediately. It is 5:00 PM, and no technician showed up, no agents and/or supervisors answer my phone calls, and I am in the limbo, since I disconnected my Dish TV service, expecting to have Comcast TV Service at 3:00 PM.\r\n\r\nIt is very suspicious, that 2 agents, in two different occasions in two different days offered me a 24 months package, if Comcast never had that kind of agreement. I believe that those two poor liars agents, among others, had been trained by Comcast's Supervisor to sell those kind of lies to clients. And now, no technician, no agent, no supervisor, no Comcast TV, no Dish TV, and nobody is responsible for inefficiencies/ineptitudes /inadequacies within the soul of Comcast.\r\n\r\nFinally Comcast technician came at 6 PM, disconnected my internet services, used all previous Dish TV cables, asked me to move and remove furniture from 2 bedrooms and clothes from a closet, unrolled white and black co-axial cables inside and outside of the house, and suddenly I saw him packing his tools, without saying a word. When he was in his truck, I asked him: \"Are you leaving and have not internet and not TV?\" He got out of his car, and connected my internet, and then said: \"Tomorrow, I will be back or a new technician for TV purposes\", and left, leaving on the floor, bunches of connected cables to TV.\r\n\r\nComcast agents and supervisors, just \"apologized again, as usual\", and nothing was resolved. Next day, September 24, no one from Comcast appeared, called, and no TV and one's responsibility. I am elevating my voice protesting with this Comcast's disorganizations and bundle of poor thing liars agents and (and do not know what to say about the Supervisors, who supposedly to be the example for those low IQ liars agents), and incompetent unrespectable, unconscious technicians (but to expect of this miserable company?)

But I noticed that I could not do Facetime, stream music or have fast browsing etc, then I did a speed test to realize that I was only getting a max speed of 1-2 Mbps and never more than that when I am paying for 6 Mbps. I called the customer care, and they tried trouble shooting and they said \"You should get at least half the speed,\" and that's the max they can do. I was SHOCKED. \r\n\r\nThey also mentioned that my package is 25 Mbps which was hard to believe, and they did something from their end to get 6 Mbps speed which was only for some time. When I checked the speed in the evening the story repeats, so I called them next day and they said they will send their technician to troubleshoot. Asked me to signup for their Service Plan, otherwise they may charge me for the technician visit. Technician came, checked the speed and went on call for 15 mins to come back and say that my package is 6 Mbps and so they can't guarantee more speed (1-2 Mbps) which was very disappointing. He says, \"WiFi is like that. We can't do anything.\" Such a lame excuse from XFINITY. I thought I would try for few more weeks, but it is no better.\r\n\r\nI am very disappointed to waste the Installation charges ($49.99) and the modem cost ($140) which was again suggested by them.

Comcast is gone from top to rock bottom... Worst internet service ever. Even terrible than AT&T. I have signed them like 3 weeks ago and the speed I am getting is 3 to 4 mbps.

A Comcast service rep recommended an upgrade to the modem box and unneeded upgrade to Extreme 150 internet service for an additional $50/month. After accepting the service, and more than one year later I learned that the Extreme 150 was no benefit for regular Mac users that do not do gaming or streaming services.

I have had to call them multiple times to deal with NIL to non-Internet speeds (I pay for blast internet). Their excuse was my equipment wasn't working properly (I have my own cable modem and router). I had Netgear run a diagnostic check and my modem was running slow so I purchased a new one that was more than capable of handling our Internet speeds. Yet, the issue continued. In September the Internet was running very slow. Then completely stopped working. I called multiple times spoke to multiple representatives and was ultimately lied to. \r\n\r\nOne representative said they'd compensate me cable and that she would dispatch a tech to meet me by 2:00 on Saturday. I waited all day. They were a no show. I call back and speak to another representative who informs me that they don't comp free cable and the prior rep hadn't put in a service order and the prior rep had also completely changed our plan! I finally get everything settled after multiple line exchanges (or so I thought). They finally decided that the Internet issue was with them and the new rep said she would send out a tech to hook up my new cable TV and check on the Internet (FREE OF CHARGE). A lady in billing also told me to call back once the tech had finished and my services were working so I could be compensated for the days I didn't had Internet. \r\n\r\nThe tech shows up right at 8. He was friendly. He explained that the cable had been undone outside (not my fault at all). He also said that my modem and router were capable of handling the speeds I am suppose to be receiving (when I call and complain they blame my modem and router). He gets the Internet installed then asks where my cable TV box is. I told him I hadn't received one. He said it was no biggie he had one in the truck (the one they mailed came a few days later and after calling them they said I had to return it to a UPS store to ship back, another waste of my time). He gets everything hooked up and running, I'm a happy camper! \r\n\r\nI then call billing and explain my story (which is of epic proportion). She agrees to compensation not as much as I deserve for a month of slow and then no Internet, not to mention the hours of wasted time on the phone with them! She tells me my $35.00 compensation will occur on my following bill. So imagine my surprise when I open my bill for October and it's double what it normally is. Their excuse is they forgot to apply my $35.00 credit. They also charged me for an Internet install (I already had Internet when the tech came!!!) and to install my cable tv. I was told it would be FREE because it was their services that were messing up. \r\n\r\nThe representative tells me she can't remove the $70.00 service charge because they have to investigate it and she also can't add two charge reduction for 1 billing cycle! So I have to pay $40.00 extra this month for Xfinity's **! I am sick and tired of having to call at least once a month about a problem! It also is absurd that they have no way of keeping track of who you've spoken with. They also have no way to call and speak to the same agent!

He fixed it and set our installation date for the 9th. Once the 9th came along they never showed up. We called again, and they said there is nothing they can do about it because in the computer it still said our apt was for the 14th.

And the 'Unlimited data option' that they mention in the FAQ? Not available for my area. There was no warning that they would be imposing this cap, the customer service rep on the phone seemed to have glossed over it, and no reasonable way to get around it.

The home page menu needs so have smaller icon/click on(s) with smaller pictures, needs to have the stock market information and new breaking news.", "In the last couple of months I have more and more trouble with Comcast or is it Xfinity to keep my Internet connection. My Internet connection is disconnected at least 10 times per day and it getting worse. When I call Comcast or is it Xfinity? It's just always the same. We can do some troubleshooting... That's it. I paid already for a technician even I had this insurance but they told me I did something wrong so the insurance wasn't valid and I paid approximately $75 extra.\r\n\r\nThe Internet page of Comcast... After 1 click it become Xfinity... Is extremely user unfriendly and extremely slow. Sometimes when I clicked on a button I don't know what happens until I see everything (the software/Internet page) is working and waiting... The Internet page of Comcast is just a bunch of... I don't know, because I have to click a dozen time and I need a lot of look to find something useful. Next time I try the same way I am always lost and always on other pages. For me it looks like Comcast WANT that the customer get lost. The Internet presence is just trash, sorry but it is.\r\n\r\nCalling Comcast (or is it Xfinity) is extremely annoying because first a machine ask you a lot questions and you have to enter a lot of numbers. One minute later you will talk with another machine but this machine ask you the same questions again and you have to enter the same number again. Today I was talking 5 (five) minutes until I came to the waiting loop and I waited 5 more minutes. If I could I would change immediately the Internet provider but Comcast has a monopoly in my area.", "My service goes out every week. I work from home and this is causing a major issue for me. As usual I called Comcast today (10/5/15) about my internet outage. I was advised by the customer service agent that there was a outage in my area. I asked if that information can be sent to me through email. I was told \"NO\". Then I asked to speak with a manager. After being on hold for over a hour, I finally was able to speak with a manager. I explained my concerns and that I need this outage information for my employer, because this has been a ongoing issue and I need to provide an explanation to my employer. \r\n\r\nThe manager put me on several holds and also advised me that she was not able to send me the needed information and that there was no outage in my area. During this whole time I still had no internet and neither issue was resolved. As I continued to explain the importance of my service and why I needed some type of documentation of the service outage the manager ID# ** disconnected the call. Immediately, after the manager hung up on me. \r\n\r\nI received 2 text messages from Comcast. The first one: \"The service outage in your neighborhood has been restored. Check your connection status anytime by logging in to https://customer.xfinity.com/m/commection/.\" Then a second message: \"Your monthly bill is available to view online. Visit www.xfinity.com/myaccount to view and pay your bill. Reply STOP to stop text from Comcast Alerts (SM).\" WOW WOW WOW. I cannot get any internet service, I cannot get customer service assistance, but now my bill is due and oh they have increased my bill $10. Comcast has done a great job of making me feel helpless and lost for words! U-verse has a $150 installation fee, but at this point I really have no choice. SMH... Something has to give...", "We've had Comcast for about 2 months now. At the beginning, our cable internet service was extremely intermittent so we called Comcast to schedule a service visit. The tech came, ended up swapping out the FAULTY cable model for a new one, and told us we wouldn't be charged. Two weeks later we got a charge on our bill for $39.99 for the service visit. We've been disputing the charge for 5 days now and each supervisor we speak to says that the charge is valid. When we signed up for Comcast, we expected their service to work. It is an absurd business model to lie to customers about not charging them for a service visit and then charging them in the end. I'd go as far as saying this company is CRIMINAL. Why should customers have to pay to have faulty equipment swapped out? DO NOT SIGN UP FOR COMCAST EVEN IF IT IS THE CHEAPEST OPTION. You will be sorry if you do.", "COMCAST! Please accept my apology for not believing your customer service agent! Thank you for all you did to help me get the service I expect! No one likes to call any cable company's customer service... EVER! Endless waits, repeated requests to speak to agent only to be ignored, and they lie to you, right? WRONG!!! I thought they were trying to sell me something I did not want when they told me my own (not Comcast equipment because mine is better, right?) wifi router needed to be replaced, then offered to sell me one. I didn't believe it until the router went black the next day. I had been putting up with what I remembered to be a few years old router (it was at least 10!) blaming Comcast for my inadequate and intermittent reception! Your equipment does not last or perform well forever, PEOPLE! \r\n\r\nOn Comcast's advice, we bought a new Motorola SurfBoard 6580. Not the latest and greatest, but more than sufficient to handle my upload and download requirements with computers, iPhones, iPads, and DirecTV. And we got it on Ebay for half of Amazon's price and free shipping because it was refurbished and without new packaging. The supplier included sensible 1-page instructions that said, first to call your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to recognize your modem ID. I did, got Laquetia right away! I almost had to wait!!! She was kind, easy to talk to and understand, chuckled at my jokes, and fixed my modem connection immediately and stayed with me until I got to my email account! I'M SO HAPPY I COULD DANCE ALL NIGHT! Thank you Comcast!!!", "I was currently an employee working as an agent helping out customers resolve internet WIFI issues. Comcast has a contract with another supporter that deals with this situation with customers. Comcast does not provide customer support with themselves. They go with another agency called support.com. Support.com employs those who have basic knowledge with networking. While working with support.com, I would have supervisors tell me I'm not there to help resolve customers issues nor help resolve complications connection with internet. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, helping out the customer, looking for the best interest of the customer, nor educating the customers on how to maintain their service with Comcast is not priority. Although I doing what I do best didn't get me in a good spot with support.com. Best way to handle customers of Comcast is to go by a script which does not solve nothing. If they want someone to follow something that ignores the customer then they should just go by an automated system to do the job. I'm not a damn robot. My scores with how they try to get the employees to improve was way off as for what they wanted. Not for what the customer wanted. I had customers ask for a direct number to me when dealing with situations with complications with Comcast Internet. But unfortunately, I could not provide such feedback to have them call me. \r\n\r\nWhat I know as far as having bad service is how they provide the untold way of how they offer the hot spot with WI-FI. About 85% of customers have no idea about this setup when taking the Gateway (modem/router) home to setup. Majority of the problem is the hot spot (Xfinity WIFI). What I want to know is, why do they keep this from the customer? Although an ex employee, and now knowing why. I would do whatever it took to get the customer situated with setup and do what I could to make sure they stay connected and not have customers have a run around with their internet connection.\r\n\r\nEvery time I got audited I always had low scores. The reason why is because they were more concerned about reading the script rather than how I helped and resolved the customers connection complications. What was always said in my score results was, I didn't show empathy and how I didn't attempt to sell customers other services. They are more concerned with saying, \"aw you having problems? I know how bad that can be. Well look here, are you interested with upgrading your internet or would you like to have cable service with us?\" Service with this place makes the reputation bad on their own. See my point? This place is just full of it. Although the customer is spending hours with agents trying to get the service working, they have employees be more concerned with telling the customer they are sorry but we have better offers. \r\n\r\nTheir devices with WIFI is crap due to how they misinform the customer they have an open network broadcasting with their personal WIFI. It causes slow connectivity and how some customers have problems with their devices switching between the connections of the Xfinity WIFI and their personal WIFI. Really, I don't have to say much. An ex employee like me on how I tried to have the best interest for the customer, they don't want a quality employee such as me to be considerate. My objective is the best interest of the customer. I would even tell the customer how to set up and disable the hot spot. Customers are the ones paying for the internet. It's not what Comcast wants, it is what the consumer wants. That's why they let me go. Let them make a fool out of themselves like they have been. Supervisor, told me we are not techs. We do not solve the customers connection issues. We follow a script. \r\n\r\nI would not be surprised the reason why they only want to go by the script is because they are only interested with having a computer do it for them. Not once did we have any meetings with how to better our work ethics with customers. My service provider is with COX communications. I never have internet problems. Only a couple times with bad storms but they were resolved fast. I never once had to speak to a rep hours at a time to resolve any issues. Comcast/ support.com, there is going to be a day where it is really going to smack you in the face to wise up. The hell with your company and support.com. Freedom of speech. And have the right to say what and how. I was booted out for the stupidest reason. To the CEO, did it even come to mind why Comcast has such a bad rep?\r\n\r\nBottom line, my consequence result was rooting for the customer. Not brown noising to the BS Supervisor on how they want to keep the customer running around. Tip to customers, there is a dual band Comcast Gateway which has customers go real pissed about. Glad I'm not working for a selfish ISP that only has interest with how they provide the connection. Kind of screwed up having an ISP that does not give the full details to customers with how all broadcasts of free WIFI's with customers gateways.", "About 3 weeks ago I switched my basic internet service with Comcast to a Bundle since it was actually cheaper at the time. $59.99 for Performance Internet (50Mbps)/HBO/Basic Cable for 12 months. I confirmed multiple times over the phone with the agent and thought everything was good. Today I called in to check on my current balance since the online system does not update for several weeks (apparently once a billing cycle). I was shocked when my balance was over a $100. The agent told me she did not know of any such package at the price point I was promised, but my account did show full pricing for the internet, some \"HD Tech\" add-on I didn't ask for, and the cable. \r\n\r\nSo they were able to pile on all the services but not successfully bill me the right amount. Go figure. Fortunately, I called in and after some difficulty was able to get most of the charges removed (we will see, I have been promised things from Comcast before). I switched back to my prior internet-only service with them. Why doesn't Comcast email a receipt for the service change? Are they afraid that something in print could be damaging to their image? They keep everything secret on their end - you have to call in constantly to make sure things are being handled properly, otherwise things just magically slip up. It's an antiquated system from an antiquated company. I just hope the near-future will offer some alternatives for ISPs (Comcast has a monopoly in my area).", "I have two options for Wi-Fi in my current location: Verizon and XFINITY (Comcast). My experience with Verizon is that they make their money by perpetually screwing up my billing. After doing this THREE times in a row, I am changing my cell phone service and avoided them for wireless internet service for my new address. That brings me to Comcast's XFINITY. I happily called them, and after waiting a week (due to technician availability), I scheduled an appointment for the tech to visit my apartment and set up the cable, internet, and relevant equipment. Well, after barely 24 hrs., I'm back at STARBUCKS writing this review. \r\n\r\nApparently the equipment Comcast uses has OCD rendering it in a state of \"perpetual reset.\" It does NOTHING but reset itself. NOTHING. While Verizon perpetually screws up my billing (tho' not for long), Comcast bills me for NOTHING. Great business plan, guys. You all SUCK. I wish I could have a job where I could make money by screwing up everything AND providing nothing in return.\r\n", "Enough is enough. Waiting for a digital box to be sent to use and 2 weeks of Comcast rescheduling service calls that they never showed up for, I finally canceled Comcast went to AT&T U-Verse. I had problems with my cable TV and internet was very slow. Every time I called they sent out a signal, it did not work also. Scheduled appointments between no shows, not being able to watch TV, or able to stay on internet. We had enough, I canceled Comcast on 09/09/2015 after 15 years of business. (AT&T found the problem right a way. The squirrels ate into cable.)", "I have continually had very terrible service with internet speed, DVR working, and getting honest and accurate customer service. My last call tonight was 47 minutes total, 33 of them on hold. The executives do not care about either customers or employees as the last two CSRs admitted they are getting tired of hearing the same complaints about terrible service and do not like working there. Comcast employees: they make gazillions and you have to hear from customers who complain... Do you think they care about you? Until customers and employees start communicating to the execs, who are only concerned about their multimillion dollar salaries/benefits and homes on Kiawah Island, crappy service will continue. Come on America! Wake up and switch to a better company!", "I don't have internet or TV working. My husband is waiting somebody answer the phone for more than 2 hours but he won't hang out because I am recording the disrespect you guys treat us to post everywhere. My name is Adriana **. My husband name is Eduardo **. We are without internet and TV about 5 days already. Nobody answer the phone. I have an important job to do but you guys don't care. I want to see if you will give a discount for 1 week without service because you stolen my money. I pay for something I don't have. You are robbers, right? This is a crime. I know your customer service is the worst in the world. The title in internet is \"Comcast sucks.\" But I want my money back now. I will report to GA Business Bureau, also Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, everywhere. I hope my husband learn the lesson. I really want to see Comcast shut the doors. That will be the happiest day of my life.", "Never got a fully installed service. Tried to contact for business service as I work from home. Made no less than 10 calls to sales and others at Comcast. Kept getting told they were calling back and emailing us and never did. Then they finally scheduled install upon threat of our canceling the service, but never showed up. A quick, no communication inspection apparently put install on hold and Comcast didn't feel that warranted a call. I called finally and found out. If this is representative of customer service, no thank you. Canceled the install, and won't be using them. Doesn't matter what download speeds they say they guarantee, if you can't get any service. I guess the competitors will have an easy time satisfying me, even if they can't guarantee the speed.", "We spent weeks working on a contract with the Denver-area Comcast to bundle our Internet and phone services. They told us that they had sent out trucks to survey our location, and that our site was serviceable. We were told this by multiple representatives - first by Amanda **, and then by Michael ** (both of whom work in the Denver corporate office in the Comcast Business Class - West Division). \r\n\r\nWe spent hours working on the contract and determining which features we needed, and we took steps to cancel our current service providers. We signed the SOA, which specifically says, \"This Agreement shall commence and become a legally binding agreement upon Customer's execution of the SOA.\" Soon after signing the SOA, Michael ** sent us an email saying only, \"We have just received the site survey results back for your location. Unfortunately we cannot service your location at this time without considerable construction costs. I apologize we couldn't make it work this time.\" \r\n\r\nOur location is serviceable, regardless of associated costs. The fact that Comcast neglected to consider the construction costs before sending us the SOA is certainly not our fault. Why was a truck not sent out to determine the associated construction costs BEFORE our site was deemed serviceable and before we signed the SOA? Not only did Michael (and the other representatives) waste our time because Comcast neglected to check the validity of the site survey, but Michael had the audacity to inform us via a brief email. His customer service skills are atrocious.\r\n\r\nMichael ** refused to provide us with the number of a supervisor until we threatened to lodge a complaint against him if he didn't. He did finally provide the email of a supervisor, Janchessa **, and asked her to contact us regarding our complaint. Not only has this Janchessa failed to contact us, she has yet to respond to ANY of the emails we have sent her. \r\n\r\nSo, not only did we waste valuable time forming a contract, but we have also endured appalling customer service from every representative we have tried to work with - Michael ** especially. The level of incompetence displayed by Comcast in the Denver area - from basic customer service to their ability to accurately interpret a simple site survey - is staggering.", "I was having trouble getting my new router to connect. I called and had a very hard time understanding the agent on the other end, and she clearly could not understand what I was saying or asking either. There were times when she would just stop talking for minutes at a time. I would have to say \"hello?\" to snap her back to the phone call. After 1.25 hours on the phone and about 5 resets of the router, I said \"let me try something\" and fixed it myself. She said \"okay I'll call you back in 15 minutes to make sure it's working\" and then never called me back.", "PLEASE READ! I have been using Comcast for a while now and I have a few things to say. First of all if you're thinking about trying Comcast I would highly recommend not doing it. I live in a duplex and my neighbors recently had a Comcast technician install internet on their side of the duplex. When they did this they messed up and disconnected my internet. I tried contacting Comcast to set up an appointment to have it fixed but the earliest they could come out was nearly a week later. I requested to have it done sooner since it was their fault and they said they would give me a call within 24 hours. NO CALL WAS MADE and I randomly had a note on my door when I got home from work saying I MISSED AN APPOINTMENT. \r\n\r\nI have been without internet that I have already paid for, for about 10 days. NO compensation was offered from them and they keep putting my appointment back. HERE'S THE KICKER, instead of offering compensation and/or repair of my service, the lady tried to sell me an upgraded package!! WOW Comcast has some of the worst customer service I've seen. Definitely do not recommend using them at all.", "Salesman came to my house offering a better service, better price than my current provider. They said to test them for 30 days, money back guarantee. Service sucks, 75mbps never had more than 10mbps. On the second day, had no service in the morning. I disconnected the service a week later, and now they want me to pay a bill for $53. The money back guarantee is a lie, they made me go thru a lot of time with customer relations department for nothing. I will not recommend this people to anyone.", "Ok, so I've had Xfinity/Comcast for almost a year now, and there has been so much trouble, I can't stand Comcast. So you are probably thinking of getting it from the commercials saying Xfinity is faster than a NASCAR pit stop. All the commercials got me hooked. I purchased the \"X1\" version, which has \"double\" the high speed internet than the normal one, and it's faster than Fios. They set it up, no hassle, only internet speed was the problem. I was supposed to be getting 5 bars and like 100mbps speed, but that turned out to be a lie immediately. My phone, computer, and Xbox were even slower than before I got it. My phone only gets 2 and 1 out of 3 wifi bars and it's a 5s brand new. \r\n\r\nWhenever I use my Xbox, It barely connects to Xbox Live, and when it does, it isn't very fast and will end up lagging me out anyways.... The broadband strength is very weak and you can't even have 2 computers on at once without slow trouble, nonetheless you can have a couple smartphones on it. My upload speed is now about 3-4 mbps and my download speed is 8, maybe even 10 mbps sometimes (According to speedtest.net). Even worse, my ping never dips below 100. I hate having to tell all my friends my internet speed and be the blame for \"lag switching\" the game with my internet. Hopefully, I may be switching to Fios soon, which ACTUALLY has good internet. So in conclusion, don't invest your time into these guys and go and get something that won't keep you behind.", "I signed up for a week pass for Xfinity wifi for 19.99. I live in center city Philadelphia (where Comcast headquarters is located). This wifi service isn't even half as fast as the 3g data on my phone. And monthly, it costs about as much as a high speed internet service. The connection constantly drops out and I'm less than a mile from the Comcast building. I guess I'm just going to go back to using my phone plan's 3g data for its superior speed and reliability. I'm not one to normally write internet reviews but I'd like to join in on the effort to pile on Comcast. The fact that a company can provide such terrible services and be so successful is appalling.", "Upon looking for internet providers in the area I was faced with one option: Comcast, so I got Comcast. From the very beginning there were service problems, low connectivity, no connectivity, on demand services didn't work or froze, they replaced the line from the pole to the house, the junction at the house, the amplifier near the house, everything, and for years we had problems. Calling customer service is very similar to willingly subjecting yourself to having bamboo slivers jammed under the fingernails. Finally we relocated and have been able to use another provider. The difference in customer service is amazing, few problems all speedily resolved and have not recurred. AT LAST we were free from Comcast, but alas, today I received a notice that I should be receiving a refund. \r\n\r\nI called simply to ask if the refund would be electronically credited to my account or by check. First I got passed to computer sally, who decided should couldn't solve the issue, then to an Agent, but the wait was very long so I was given a callback. Twenty minutes later I am called by an individual who is probably not actually capable of writing his own name intelligently, who fumbles around for a few minutes before transferring me to someone else, which took 21 minutes to connect with, turns out the lady I was transferred to was not able to view my account because it isn't an active account (even though they didn't need to access my account because it was a simple question), then transferred to the proper person. SO in conclusion if you are considering Comcast as a service provider please be aware that any problem however small will require a soul crushing amount of excrement wanting to be resolved.", "I cancelled the service in the last week of December and I returned the Comcast box few days later. I paid all my bill. In January I received a bill with new charges for January and when I called Comcast I was informed that the service was not cancelled. After 30 minutes on the phone I was told that my service was cancelled and I don't need to pay for January. A week later I found out that the service was not closed and I spend over 1 hour on the phone being transferred to 5 different Comcast reps, I guess in India, they don't speak well English. I was assured that the service will be closed in 2 working days. He could not close the service because this is an internal Comcast thing.", "On Xbox One on GTA 5 I join a game for 5 mins and LAG out. I finally join a game after 10 mins!!!!

So I play GTA 5 and it takes 1 min to join his game. 3 hours later skype goes out and I call him back. No probs, played MC, no lobby lag, SOOO happy.", "I was a customer with Comcast. They lied about the discount. Was suppose to have someone do the work so I could get internet service, but he didn't do the work. So, they had to send a tech over after I waited for service for four days. They said there would be no charge for the tech coming out since it was their fault that my service was not ready. Wrong! They charged me for everything. They gave me a discount for 12 months then automatically signed me up for the next year without my consent. The bill was getting higher and higher so I called them. The customer service person told me that the discount they gave me for the past twelve months was added to my bill and each month they charged extra until it was paid. How can these people get away with this? It is as though no one can stop these crooks from their crooked business dealings. I need an internet service. All of them are liars and crooks!!!", "For the entire time we have been forced to have Comcast - monopolies still exist in our area - we have experienced spectacularly atrocious customer service. Our phone line has been on and off for a year and a half now. Calling to make yet another appointment with yet another incompetent service technician (the phone center is in Manila) takes a minimum of 45 minutes each time, multiple waits, transfers, and often dropped calls. Comcast then usually misses the appointment. If the guy ever arrives he consistently says the past work on the phone line was shoddy, and he spends an hour to two hours not fixing the line. He then promises to call the next day or the day after to continue the work, but never calls back.\r\n\r\nThe last guy actually left his tools here, called, and then came back for them the next day and tried to fix it again. Of course he couldn't, and again promised to call the following day. He did not. When the line again stopped working I spent another hour on the phone with Comcast, made an appointment for the next day, which they did not keep. When I called to complain I was told \"they tried to reach you and couldn't.\" This is, frankly, impossible because I gave my cell phone number and that would have taken a phone message if I did not directly answer it. No message was left. In other words, the technician just lied.\r\n\r\nI cannot quite encapsulate the level of awfulness that Comcast \"customer service\" embodies. If we had any option for phone service and high speed internet we would long ago have switched to ANY other entity. Comcast makes the old Ma Bell seem caring, efficient and cost-effective. I have wasted dozens of hours on Comcast, and as of this very minute I still have a non-working LANDLINE, a technology that dates back to the 19th century. Wow. Frankly, the board and leadership of Comcast should be fired, since shooting them remains illegal in America.\r\n", "I appreciate that Comcast offers xfinity for $20, although it is pretty damn slow, and unreliable. It is a nice option for a student like myself. Unfortunately, until recently I would have a hotspot through wifi free to use when the service I am paying for wanted to stop working temporarily. It would at least equal a somewhat usable service.\r\n\r\nJust the other week whenever I try accessing the hotspot it asks for my login info, and when I supply it I'm given a message my tier of service does not qualify. Excuse this lowly peasant, ComCast. I am so sorry I'm not spending $70 a month for your service to access your hotspot when the connection I'm paying for decides to be doo doo on a daily basis. I just wanted to vent this recent inconvenience, and we all know how far I would get if I had done so over the phone to their customer service, and good luck finding an email to contact ComCast at.", "Do NOT pay for services with Comcast/Xfinity. Upon signing on with Comcast, I was very optimistic. It wasn't until I had extra charges on my account that I changed my mind. I spent months getting the charges reversed. To top it off, my internet would just stop working on a monthly basis. One tech told me that there were just too many people in my area and there was nothing they could do about it. Another told me that I would have to spend time resetting the modem every month and hope that it would come back on.\r\n\r\n8 months later, they finally admitted to giving me faulty equipment, and although I had already been to the store and waited in line, the only way to get functional equipment without being charged would be to go back to the store (which is 30 min away) and exchange the equipment. Meanwhile, I am supposed to pay for services that I am unable to utilize. Oh, my other option was to go to Walmart and buy my own personal modem. Once again...

It's humorous how horrible they are. If you love no internet, and horrible service, Comcast is just right for you! I'd say the company is comparable to the U.S government in the sense that lying, stealing, and most likely laughing about it is upheld as a virtue and probably plastered across their walls as their daily goals. On the bright side, the modem they supply you provides other uses. If you ever needed a hole in your wall, just wait until you try and use your internet or connecting with support, then take the modem, and huck it at the wall out of impending rage.", "The customer service rep was so rude and indifferent. I felt as though the 45 minutes I wasted on the phone being bullied and belittled was unforgivable. I have only been a customer for 2 months! THIS IS NOT RIGHT! I will never recommend this service and as soon as I can cancel and move to a different company I will be doing so.", "I am so frustrated with Comcast. I had business service and had to close my business. When I called Comcast to cancel, I was informed that the early disconnect penalty would be over $1000.00 because I was in a three year contract. Small business fail every day... So why would Comcast require a 3 year contract with such a massive penalty? So I called back 9 times - put on hold for extremely long periods of time trying to get some options. I was given a business rep's name for the Dallas area and she hung up on me when I explained my situation. I called back and left three messages and she never called back. Finally, after paying the bill for 4 months with no service, a customer service rep advised me to transfer the business account to my residence... Which I had to add Internet and pay double the price... I agreed to do that. I still have to add cable separately because business service in your home does not uncle cable (another additional cost). \r\n\r\nI finally got the service installed (Internet and phone) after a missed appointment that I took off work for. Now that the phone is installed, I disconnected the residential phone. I have NO phone service throughout the home, only in one room. I called Comcast and was told that business service only works on one phone. What?!? Seriously?? Why would the rep suggest transferring service if I could only have service in one room? Why wasn't I informed of that? Now I have no monitoring for my security system. Again, Comcast provided no options! I cannot believe this company survives with the way they treat their customers. As soon as this contract is up, I am canceling!", "After I sold my house, I paid all final charges from Comcast. A few weeks later a sleazy salesperson called and convinced me that I should only put my account on hold until I moved into my new house which was then under construction. Trusting him, I agreed, and paid a few months charges of $14/mo for nothing at all, and then started getting invoices for over $200 per month. Starting in 8/15, I have had at least 8 phone sessions (very lengthy) and 6 office visits to get resolved their billing me for no service whatsoever. When I moved into my new house in Sept, it took me until Dec to get them to start new service and now they say I owe them for a 'bad debt' of over $100.00. I was courteous today, but agent could not find the source of the charges and ended up just cutting me off. Beware of sales calls from Comcast.", "After contemplating for 2 years to switch to Comcast I finally decided because AT&T Internet was driving me crazy. It was soooooo slow. We couldn't even watch Netflix on our tv or watch movies/shows on our Direct due to poor internet error all the time. And I work from home and it would drop connection all throughout the day. On March 3 Comcast came out, guy showed up and was working outside. After about an hour he tells me the tap on my street is dead. He was calling a technician to see if available to come out look at it, said I would need reschedule possibly. He told me that he should have checked tap on first before he started and he didn't. So I have this big box with cables everywhere hanging on side house. \r\n\r\nI was ok with that because I had not cancelled my Direct or AT&T yet. He leaves about 5, then my kids go to watch TV and it's not working. So, this idiot does not come back and you know he knew he had unhooked all Directv cords and rerouted to the new box. I call and of course I'm told they will expedite this, but no guarantee. Needless to say at this point my rescheduled date is March 15th, so these fools are leaving us without cable until then. After about 2 emails, 3 phone calls later on March 4, a guy shows up at my home, not the idiot that unhooked these cables, but new guy and plugs all cables back in. But after 1 hour on phone with Direct, still NO cable. \r\n\r\nSo I had to schedule Direct to come out on March 11 to reconnect and get me back up and running and hope they don't charge me a fee to so. This guy John did at least give me his # to call and come back out on Saturday if box does not start working. So I call him back and he said he will try find a guy to come out, but UNSUCCESSFUL. They were \"loaded\" he said for day and would thought maybe heard back from him, but \"crickets\". Now, I did not want to rate COMCAST/INFINITY because I feel they don't deserve my rating because they've showed me the service that I will be getting with them, but I had to choose a 1 star. But COMCAST don't get cocky, because really you are a big fat ZERO star in my eye right now. So now to decide to continue to make my switch or not. Very, very dissatisfied customer.", "So I had Xfinity internet service only at my home. I was paying 49.95 per month plus 10.00 for equipment rental so a total of 59.95. One day my bill increased to 89.95 plus the 10.00 so I called in to cancel the service as I had other companies I could choose for half that price. I was told how \"sorry\" they were that I wished to cancel and wanted me to speak to a customer retention agent, so I agreed. I was told that while they could not lower JUST my internet, they could give me cable AND internet for 69.95, so basically the same thing but I would have cable as well. So I agreed...and this was where the nightmare began.\r\n\r\nThey sent me a home install kit which I did and it never functioned. I was told after an hour of troubleshooting on the phone that the box appeared to be faulty so take it to the closest Comcast office and they would replace it. I did this. It too did not work. So finally they sent out a technician. He found an issue in the box outside that he rectified and the service now worked, HOWEVER he also told me I had an unnecessary booster amp on my service which he had removed so I should now have the best service I could get. He left. From that moment my internet did not work, it constantly lost signal. So they sent out a second tech two days later, who came in my home and said \"Oh they are sending the wrong rate code to your modem, so I have had that rectified and it's good now\". \r\n\r\nHe left and it still did not work. So a third tech came out. This time he verified I had poor signal and but was unable to fix the issue. He said he believed maintenance would need to come and change out the cable from the house to the street which was then scheduled for the following wed. The automated call to make sure I was home happened at 2pm Wed to ensure I would be home from 3-5pm. I got home and waited. 5.30 came and no tech. I called and was told, \"oh we have you scheduled for Friday\". I asked then \"why did your system call me to verify I was home?\" He then told me \"oh it looks like you were scheduled for Wed pm but we moved it to Friday\". SO now I am waiting Friday and he comes out and changes the wire from the street to the house and...NO FIX. \r\n\r\nSo A few days later the next tech comes out (now I have had 4 techs and 24 days of no service and I have had to take of 4 half days from work) so here we are another half day missed from work and a 5th tech. This guy doesn't even work from Comcast. He works for a local cable installer that they subcontract. He checks it all and then says \"You Need an amp\" (which I had prior to the original tech coming out to install cable). He added it and the issue was resolved. THEN I got my bill!!!\r\n\r\nSo despite being told of the credits I would be getting for no service, failed technician calls and missed appointment it was not 79.95, it was $245.00!!! They charged me for the call outs. I called to complain and was told they were not going to credit me so I lost 2.5 days of work, 24 days of service and was charged a small fortune because of their own incompetence. I spent a combined total of 13 hrs and 47 mins on the phone with them (not included the first three calls I made which I didn't record the times on) but I estimate that brings it to 16 hrs or so...", "Xfinity has taken over my wifi without my consent... I would NEVER subscribe to xfinity because of this... Leave me alone and get off my server!!!", "Comcast's internet is bafflingly unreliable. To make matters worse, they have an absolute monopoly in my area. This means that no matter how poor their customer service or how unreliable their internet, they are the only option. I hope that Comcast understands that if Google Fiber ever comes near here, I'm willing to move just to get away from their Xfinity garbage.", "My home internet went out, called customer service and call was dropped 10 times... These IT people are foreign and I could not understand them and they could not understand me. FINALLY after having been dropped 10 times, they said they would send someone out the next day between 8 and 10. I stayed home from work and they never showed up! A work order was never put in. SURPRISE!! I was without internet for 3 days... I depend on internet for work. This is the absolutely WORST company EVER! They want my cable business... REALLY?? Fat Chance! The Dish Network it is!! AVOID them and save yourself a huge headache!!", "I called Comcast - 1-800-934-6489 on December 12-07-2015, I complained about excessive charges billed to my account every month including bogus late fees even when they claim I brought the account current, and bogus activation fees even when the account was never interrupted. Then I called back again to request a disconnect for the entire account. At this time, I was told I was going to be charged a early termination fee, which I don't have a contract with Comcast so I don't understand why I would be charged a fee to terminate. I just need to disconnect so additional fee wouldn't apply.\r\n\r\nSo I proceeded to ask to whom was I speaking with and the representative refused to give me any information to identify herself only to say her name was Willet with no ID # claiming that it was against company policy to provide me with that number which I thought was weird because I was provided with the prior ID # number from the prior CSR which I spoke with earlier. After the back and forth with refusal to identify herself, I informed her that the call was being recorded. She was concerned and put me on hold for a long period of time. Then the call was disconnected. I'm very upset my entire work day was ruin and also my issue was never resolved, now the only thing I can expect is a billed with bogus outstanding charges to my account that will probably hit my credit in error. Please help this wrong.", "I called Comcast to set up Wi-Fi for an apartment I recently moved into. An appointment was setup for someone to come install it. We talked about when I would get my first bill and even got a confirmation number. When I moved in, no one showed up so I called Comcast. They did not even have my name in their system at all. The man told me that the previous tenant still had an active account at the location so I wasn't able to make an account. So then, I talked to my landlord and we talk to Comcast together. \r\n\r\nComcast said that they would call the previous tenant and NOT make me drive an hour to a service center. Another appointment was set up for someone to install it. Now, I just got a call saying I actually do have to go to a service center or no one will come to install the internet. I wish I could rate lower than one star. This service is absolutely terrible. I will absolutely move somewhere that provides a different internet company.", "If you're ever planning on getting Comcast internet provider, don't. Because they will cheat you on the pricing for packages that are expensively horrible. They make false advertisements of claiming to be the fastest internet provider. They're not. Imagine paying $60 a month for average internet to work on things, but it seems like your internet fluctuate like crazy and it is as slow as a 1 GB phone internet service. \r\n\r\nAnd going to customer support? Calling doesn't work because you'll call them and they'll tell you the same darn thing every time as a solution for your internet -- \"Restart your modem.\" No, it doesn't work. And then you try to negotiate with them on other possibilities to fix this issue, yet all they do is curve you into other directions trying to show you more packages and making you pay even more for even more horrible services. Like are you going to help me or not? Or are you just going to curve me and distract me and cheat me and make me pay more than what I request? \r\n\r\nComcast takes a step even further in creating XFINITY WiFi from your modem without your consent. At the start of set-up, they create the internet leaving it open. By doing that people can use your internet without paying a single bill, while you're here paying heavy loads. And honestly if you're new to tech well let me just explain to you just how false marketing this company and just how bullshit this company is. First off your modem, or your internet box. The insides are made in the 90s. They're not modern stuff. They just put the 90s insides in a new plastic case and say they're state of the art modems. They do this so they pay less on providing these internet boxes and it doesn't even work well either way, and the fact that they make you pay for renting their modem too, is just full of bull crap. \r\n\r\nLike calling them wouldn't help. They even go as far in disrespect as hanging up the call on you midway without even answering your questions. This company can't provide internet for life, yet they still falsely advertise about it. I suggest looking for a different internet service other than Comcast. Its better to save lots of money and have a good internet standing, than paying a whole lot and getting internet slow as a sloth.", "The wife works from home, and uses the internet to connect to her company. Recently she was unable to connect. She called Comcast to schedule service. The technician showed up three days after call. In the interim my wife cannot access the internet, so 3 days no pay. The technician troubleshoots, determines that it's a bad cable in the family room... other end of house on lower level. He replaces the cable, charges $75 for the installation. He leaves and is still in the driveway and our internet goes down. She immediately attempts to get him back, but he has to go to next appointment. Now we don't have TV reception in bedroom, internet is still down and we paid $75 for a cable that didn't need replacing. We're now told it'll be 3 more days for another technician to come out... Meanwhile my wife can't work and will have lost a week's pay.", "My name is Ken. I been with you guy, long enough to say loyalty. But certainly you take away Spike Channel without courtesy notice.

Calling in to get assistance is a joke - having to use the voice answering machine. Get overseas reps that can't understand English and get mixed up by the language barrier. Don't actually get the package at the price promised and more fees that shouldn't be on. Absolute horrible to deal with!! So frustrated! ", "Tried to sign up for Comcast, but after waiting 4 weeks for the installer to show up, called to see what was going on, and was told that our address didn't exist in their system. Never mind that the house has been there for 60 years, or that they could find the address just fine when we were signing up and said they'd send someone within a week... Went to ** and found that we could get Frontier, so ordered that instead.", "They mis-charged and double charged my service!!! I returned my modem and stopped my service 4 months ago but they just keep sending bills to my mailbox. I never use their service since 4 months ago but why they charged me for that? When I calling them, they can't explain where those bills come from and keep telling me \"don't worry\". I mean this is so irresponsible. I double checked my receipts many times and I don't know what is what. They can't explain these for you either. Avoid their ** service if you can. And those customer services' accent over the phone?? Give me a break!!!", "Minus 5 stars. I am so glad I cancelled my Comcast since I use antenna TV, no longer have a VoIP landline phone, use a smartphone and wifi spots. Comcast can no longer hold me hostage because I took control!! They sent the cable guy 3 different times just to get signal to my apartment. First cable guy made up the story that rats ate the cable, second cable guy that he couldn't reach the attic. They couldn't figure out a wiring problem. I had to lease one of their refurbished modems (aka JUNK unreliable used electronic device) which crashed on me 4 time in 6 months and had to return them. So I spent $170 on a new modem just to get Comcast! My bill jumped from $19.95 a month to $39.95 + $4.95 \"protection plan\" a month and a $9 late fee. So they terminated my service.\r\n\r\nWhen I paid $86 for the past due, I thought they would reconnect. But no - they issued a \"hard\"(?) disconnect as opposed to a \"soft\" disconnect. Then they pleaded to keep me as a customer. Heck no!! So now they owe me a $9.57 refund. No wonder this is the worst-rated company out there! Good riddance of Comcast because I don't need them! I fought the battle with Comcast and won!!", "Hello everyone. I have been a Comcast customer for the past 4 years. Comcast has great services but don't work good with its customers. I recently go divorced and had to take the service with me. I could no longer afford the services I previously had with them and I called them to see if they were able to help me. The representative told me he would help me get a deal to help. I ended up with a package that cost $40 more and at first I thought maybe it's the startup cost. So I finally got my new bill and that was the new price. So I call them and let them know. They told me there was nothing they could do. I'm stuck paying the new price and on top of that they gave me a new 2 year contract. So now to cancel, they want me to pay close to $1000.00 to leave their company.", "I signed up with xfinity and had no working service for 37 of the first 44 days. I called everyday trying to get it to work. In addition to not having the service they had a line running across the front of my yard that was not buried and 2 kids tripped over it. They still did not send anyone out to fix that. With my bill I was charged for the installation fee of $350 upfront when it was supposed to be monthly. When I attempted to get that fixed they charged me an additional $350 plus the $58 monthly fee. I have called numerous times to fix it and when I show my frustration the call magically hangs up and nothing gets accomplished. I have spent over 10 total hours on the phone and have a bill for over $600 still.

After a year of dealing with their Customer service, (probably outsourced in the Philippines) I will be looking for another provider. Comcast is charging way too much for a service that they hardly deliver on. Why is it so difficult to keep my internet functioning? Why do my speeds vary so much? Is there a department of evil minions that intentionally keep decreasing my internet speed in hopes that I will not notice?", "I really hate speaking to representatives from India. You need to have American people working to handle the problems. You can't understand these people and you're already mad about the service.

Awful service! Hire competent people! Evidently you have low pay, incompetent people working for you! Thank goodness there is Netflix and I do not pay for your service (condominium account). I would never buy it!", "There are not enough words to express how dissatisfied I am with Comcast and their lack of service. Monday morning (12/14/2015) a gentleman came out to set up a new modem that my job had previously arranged for work at home purposes. The technician was very nice and professional. Know that the low rating is not due to the technician that came out, but for the manner in which Comcast conducts business.\r\n\r\n12/14/2015 I noticed that the cable panel box that the technician had to access in my bedroom closet was never put back together (it is still not together as I type this review). The cable wires were out and panel needs to be screwed back. I didn't want to touch this myself not knowing if any cables need to be hooked to anything specific. Called my apartment complex to see if maintenance could do it and I was instructed to contact Comcast. I thought this would be easy enough - honest mistake and they can have someone come out to get my wires, etc back to being in order. Agent told me on the phone Monday by me calling after 6 (around 6:15/6:30 when I called) that they would have someone out 1st thing the next day. Because it is considered a hazard he stated that he was going to put in an escalation ticket.\r\n\r\n12/15/2015 - I did not hear from Comcast or a technician as to a time, so I contacted Comcast around noon. The agent that I spoke with stated that someone would be out around 6 p.m. Well, no one called or showed up yesterday evening. I contacted Comcast again around 6:30 cst. I explained to the agent what happened and that I need someone out in the morning. He told me that the system will only let him put the visit down for Friday the 18th, but that he was putting a note in the system for a supervisor to contact me 1st thing the next morning (12/16) to get that appointment taken care of today, 12/16. I was not going to trust that considering the broken promises Comcast previously gave me.\r\n\r\nI spoke with an agent this morning (12/16) who put in another escalation ticket and I was to receive a call within an hour. After it being almost 2 hours hearing from no one again, I called Comcast again and asked for a Supervisor. The supervisor that I spoke with stated that she could not request for someone to come out today. She had to see the next available time which would be Friday, 12/18/2015. So - basically it seems a supervisor cannot do any more than the actual agents. For this matter to be deemed a hazard by Comcast and to have been escalated you would think Comcast would have someone here asap to place the wires that go in the panel back like they should be and to then close off the panel in the manner in which it should be. Instead - it is now Wednesday & I still exposed cable wires and whatever else is inside of that panel.\r\n\r\nThe people at the top really need to look at how this company is being ran. A little common sense goes a long way. This matter could have been resolved quick & smooth. There was an honest mistake made by the person who came out on Monday. Comcast should have apologized for the matter and from there, thought outside of the box and made a special appointment to rectify a situation that was not my fault. Instead they have me, the customer, continuously call to try and get this taken care of. Not once have I received a call from a supervisor. 12/16/2015 - still waiting for someone to find it important enough to have a technician come out and fix the issue of exposed wires and panel that needs to be screwed back.", "I obtained a bundle service from Comcast to include TV, internet and Home Security. One would assume the contract for all services within the bundle would end at the same time. WRONG!!! TV and Internet service ends after 2 years BUT Home Security is 3 years! I will be charge $770.00 at the end of my 2 year TV & Internet contract to cancel the Home Security service or I must keep home service for the remainder of the contract.", "For roughly the past 4 months, my internet service has been unreliable. To be clear, it works 95% of the time but it is unreliable. It will drop. The impact is upon my ability to effectively function at times. Everything that I do both personally and professionally is dependent upon having a high quality, reliable internet connection. By all accounts, that is supposed to be cable. I have checked with others in my neighborhood. Most seem to be using AT&T Uverse and having no issues. One other neighbor reports having Comcast and also experiencing issues. When it drops, not only am I unable to work on the internet, it is a distraction and often requires effort to recover from the outages. \r\n\r\nIt seems apparent that Comcast is having infrastructure issues and perhaps not pursuing this with what AT&T would call a focus on \"dial tone reliability\". I went to the Comcast office last weekend (7-8 days ago) and swapped out the modem/router. I learned that I had not had the best modem/router for the service that I am buying. All the same, I have had outages since I changed the modem/router.

From the beginning the quality of the services varied from bad to worse. At first I complained in passing, but only when the service just wouldn't work. As my technical knowledge improved I realized on a good day I was receiving speeds of approximately 35 mbps and bad days 11mbps. I complained several times until finally I was told the modem/router provided by Xfinity was not capable of offering the service I was paying for and I was refunded $26. This is particularly frustrating since I am expected to pay for the service I requested, but it seems that Comcast is not required to provided the service they agreed to provided and the onus of understanding and finding the problem lies the customer.", "Comcast what a joke! I've been with Comcast for about going on two years locked in a contract! Biggest mistake of my life. Always having issues with low speed internet & picture & sound on TV!!!

It turned out that the problem was the first technician that made everything wrong. But the worst part is that they charge me for the second technician that came to fix the work of the first one. When I called to ask for my money back their answer was that I didn't hired an insurance to cover that. WHAT!!!! I have no idea, you have to buy and insurance to fix others mistakes.

The offshore tech support in the Philippines that I generally always get sent to has really poor English communication skills. We were told that we would be credited for the past 6 months of being double billed and that credit would go to our business account yet our service was shut off for being unpaid and having an outstanding balance.

He passed away 3 years ago in November (2012) and I am now the owner of this home and the caregiver of my adult Developmentally Disabled sister, who loves to watch TV and movies. Every year for the last 3 years, like clockwork, my cable boxes go out and I cannot watch TV. Our cable is basic, and is included in our Homeowners Association fees. We do not have any add-ons or premium channels, DVR boxes, etc. Just the basic cable that comes with HOA.\r\n\r\nEvery SINGLE month, like clockwork it goes out. Every single month I call to see why it is out and they can NEVER find MY account. When I give them my phone number they have NO record of it. If I give them my social security number they locate an account I had from an apartment in Delray Beach and then a condo in Deerfield Beach, which both have been long gone, for MANY years. They tell me they cannot delete or close those accounts. Mind you, there is NO balance on those either.\r\n\r\nThey give me a different account number every month that I call and when I give it to them the next month, that this happens like clockwork, those never work either! When they finally locate the account through the box numbers, they tell me there is an open balance, that has not been paid. They claim that balance is owed by my deceased Father, because he is still in possession of said boxes. Are they kidding me? Every month I explain, he did not run off with your boxes, he DIED. His cable was paid through his HOA and has since been transferred to a new account, which is under MY name and there is NO balance, because I now have the equipment, which is INCLUDED in our plan that the HOA has with XFinity. No one ran off with your boxes they are still in use!\r\n\r\nEvery MONTH they turn the cable off, EVERY month they cannot find my account and they have even had technicians OUT TO MY HOME to install and fix the boxes. I am self employed, and EVERY month I have to call them, and spend a minimum of 3 hours on the phone, and speak to at least a dozen people explaining this situation to EVERY one of them apparently none of them seem to speak to each other within their own company. One time I even waited ALL day for a technician to come to my home and at 8pm they still hadn't shown up they never came! This has not only cost me a considerable amount of money, since I am self employed and not tending to my OWN clients or business, but it has caused SEVERE mental anguish of having to rehash the fact that my Dad is deceased, not running off with their petty cable boxes, and also calming my Developmentally Disabled sister down from not being able to watch television.\r\n\r\nThis is EVERY month without fail. WHY they can't seem to straighten this out after 3 years and 2 months at this point, is beyond me? How long with this go on? We even tried closing my Father's account and reopening a new one in my name with the equipment and it STILL is happening? What if an entirely different owner moved in with a new name and lived at this address? Cable is still provided by the Association regardless of the owner, so what is the issue?\r\n\r\nJust today, after speaking with them for over 2 hours and literally 10 people, my phone call was disconnected and they never called back. When I called them back, I got a completely different person, who could not speak English and did not understand me (I speak very clear English as I was born and raised American.). I had to repeat my name, phone number, address, account number and serial number on the equipment a minimum of 3 times, speaking very loud and clear. Again, they had no trace of my phone number or information, nor of my equipment as I stood here reading the off the number to her from THEIR receipt from when they installed it. Mind you above I said that in the previous phone call they located me THROUGH the cable box serial numbers. \r\n\r\nThis is COMPLETE insanity! They threw me on hold again for another 30 minutes and when the next rep picked up, she said her name then disconnected me. OMG, this was over 3 hours of telephone hassle and it is STILL NOT resolved. OMG!!! To add to this, I, or our HOA, has never received so much as a free movie for our time and troubles, much less a refund for the time our service was off. If I had their TV service for barely an hour, you can rest assured that they would send me a bill for it at this point, XFinity Comcast Cable should be paying US for our time, trouble and all the outings we have experienced. \r\n\r\nMy rate per hour for my business is $100 per hour, as of this morning alone, they cost me $300 in lost wages alone, not to mention how upset I am over this, reassuring them that my dead Father hasn't stolen their boxes, and calming down a grown adult with the mind of a 5 year old. This is horrendous... I can't go through this with this XFinity Comcast Cable, such an awful company any longer not another month, not another minute!\r\n", "My wife works at home for a major energy company as a call center operator. The company provides Comcast \"business class\" service so she can log calls, report outages, and perhaps most importantly alert fire and rescue personnel during natural gas leaks and electrical power line issues. The speed varies so widely and so randomly that the VPN connection to the company systems is lost many times each day. We have had their technical people out dozens of times without any improvement.\r\n\r\nI am a computer systems analyst and also work from home often. I have AT&T DSL and have patched her into my network. While the Comcast connection will *sometimes* test with much faster speed, it is just as often much slower than the DSL connection and certainly much less reliable. I'll take slow and reliable over fast and flaky any time. Since the Comcast connection is provided by the energy company, I am not able to share any specific information other than the issues we've had and the results we have had to implement to solve the problem.", "Trying to get Comcast to service your home is an unfathomable hill unless you live in an extremely populated area where they know they can get instant service from a large amount of people. I have tried to have a site survey done to see if they could provide internet service in my location. I was told this should not take more than 2 weeks at the most. I called multiple times and each representative told me the same thing, \"It should have been done by now\" and then they would mention to wait a few more days before submitting to their supervisor and they would call me back with results. \r\n\r\nAfter a few days, no call. I called them back and get the response \"I can't believe no ones updated you on this\". And finally they submit a note to their supervisor and promise to call me back. I call them back and after over a month of waiting and getting the same answer from each rep I'm told there was a decision showing they cannot service because they are not the cable company in the area. They gave me the name of another unheard of company. I gave that company a call to find they have been bought out by another company who currently is not offering internet in the area and the company before never offered it in the first place. I have never heard of these other companies and Comcast is the only cable company everyone including 2 people on my street has. \r\n\r\nI called back Comcast again and told them this new info and of course they opened another ticket for me which means I will have to wait another month and call over and over to have no results again. Not to mention in between I called numerous times and each rep seemed to have different information, and one time I was told no ticket for me even existed. So I hung up, called back for another rep and they found it right away.", "We've been with Comcast for years with no problems. We tried to upgrade and it has been three weeks and no upgrade. We called several times with several names and badge numbers with appointments to match. Appointments were made but not kept.", "So I've been with Comcast since November 2015 and have never had to call for any reason especially since I'm self sufficient with any electronics that come in and out of my home. I had to Call 4 times alone today, about a call I receive from Comcast on Monday about my account. Seems like calls are not monitored for q&a purposes, they do a very poor job at leaving notes, and clearly your system has been compromised. I have not signed my name and number to anything since signing up with them months ago for anything, and I received a fraud call from a rep claiming to work at Comcast's payment dept in Connecticut, requesting my information.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking with the reps today, not only was there no documentation of the call but the very last rep stated they no longer OB calls to customers for payment arrangements since April of this year. Never received a notice about it nor have I ever fallen behind before. The experience the CSR reps provide is clearly bottom of the barrel. Sorry to say, but I work for T-Mobile. I am a top performer and provide phenomenal customer service to any customer that calls. Hints: why we are ranked #1 JDP amongst all carriers. And I expect the same when I call. And just an FYI: for the superiors responsible for training the reps this way make sure you also remember: \"no customers, no pay checks\". Without \"us\" there is no \"you\".\r\n\r\nI understand why this company has ranked the very bottom 7 consecutive years, and for that reason the pay will always be poor for the reps and the company Will either go under due to loss of revenue or just barely floating above water. Know that customers like I will gladly pay the extra $10 for the same service with someone else for a better experience.", "Comcast, you've done it again! On 12.10.15 I called your US sales to upgrade my internet from Performance to Blast. The agent convinced me that I should purchase the Xfinity Triple Play with Extreme 150 and free Comcast phone service. I appreciated that as she was actually saving me a few dollars over my previous $250.00 per month package. I informed her that I will not require voice and that I own my own data modem. I asked her when my Extreme 150 would be available, she indicated immediately as long as I power off and on my cable modem and that the voice service would take 24 hours to activate. I was just fine with that because I do not need voice! This is where the NIGHTMARE begins! I performed the necessary steps of recycling my modem per the Comcast sales agent and was anxious to see my speed increase. \r\n\r\nAlas, there was no speed increase as shown by the Comcast Speed Test and others so I logged into my account to see what was happening. I was extremely surprised to see that my internet service was actually downgraded to ECONOMY. I noticed that my speeds started to decrease so I started an online chat session to gain assistance as the US office was now closed. I do not want to bore you with the GORY details of my chat, but after 30 minutes I was directed to contact the Activation Group. OK, I'm good with that, but why didn't my sales agent tell me that! So, I contacted the activation team, who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about! They transferred me to technical support in Manila. After one hour of tech support doing who knows what, my internet download/upload speeds were 3mb and 1mb respectively. \r\n\r\nI asked why my account showed ECONOMY as I just had purchased EXTREME 150. The representative said I indeed had Extreme 150 and my service was pending activation! I told him that's why I am talking to him as the chat agent directed me there for activation! He transferred me to billing who said the my account is pending activation, even though my online account showed that the new service was active and the phone was pending. I asked for a supervisor. Sparing you more GORY details. Two hours later, I was assured that my EXTREME 150 would be running in the morning after I powered on/off my cable modem. You guessed it! No EXTREME 150, and my account showed that I still had ECONOMY internet. As a side note, not one COMCAST representative could tell me why! \r\n\r\nSo, this morning, I once again called COMCAST, because I knew that I would be talking with at US representative and I might have a shot at getting this resolved! You guessed it! After 1 hour and repeated requests to talk to a supervisor (who were all in meetings), Comcast finally revealed to me the issue! I need a cable modem with voice capabilities. Oh, by the way that's another $10.00 per month! Of course I asked COMCAST all of the right questions: Why was I not told this at the time I purchased my new package? Why was I bounced around to multiple COMCAST support representatives, of which none could help me or explain how to resolve the issue? Why does my account STILL say that I have ECONOMY internet service? Why am I able to upgrade the ECONOMY service to another level when I have already purchased Extreme 150? Interesting! \r\n\r\nOf course, I did receive apologies, but no answers to my questions. So, I am now waiting for a COMCAST modem to be shipped to my home. When I asked the sales agent to expedite shipping for me as compensation for my experience, she indicated that it will be an additional $29.99! Of course, Comcast agents had no sympathy or remediation for the 4 to 5 hours I spent on the phone, with an escalated blood pressure level! Cmon COMCAST! Give me a break and make it right! I've only been a LOYAL customer of yours for the last 20+ years and who knows how many tens of thousands of dollars! Oh, and I forgot. I have another account for which I will soon be paying extra for data over 300mb. I may as well direct deposit my check right to you!", "I was set up on automatic payments and they billed me a couple times, then shut my service off because they said my card expired which it didn't, but I gave them all the info again... They said it could take like 30 or more days to update yet they didn't change anything, and then after on phone AGAIN for two hours they found out they applied it to my OLD account... and they swore it was fixed and guess what... it's still not fixed! I have updated online and over the phone and that dumb chat thing and NO ONE will help me fix it! They say well \"I just take payments... Let me transfer you...\" (again) and click! Hung up on over and over while they charge me late fees and reconnect fees though it's their fault, they don't know how to operate a business! SOOOO IRRITATING!!! \r\n\r\nI wish there was another cable company in our area that was good enough to switch to. They know there isn't so they don't care about us at all and just raise the rates every year... such a trap!!! They need a lawsuit against them. The manager there \"Sarah\" hung up on me on purpose one night, four times in a row. That was not an accident and no I was not being rude. I simply wanted to give them money and ensure they have it right this time. Ongoing for about a year now. They need to be bought out by someone that cares about their customers, and go to jail for ripping everyone off. I have never heard one good word about them. How are they still in business?! Ugh.", "This November, when I called Comcast to transfer my account from the east coast (Wilmington, Delaware) to the west coast (Concord, California), I found out that I was being charged for modem even though I had my own modem since 2010. The customer service agent informed me that they started charging me last year, April 2014. The total amount at the time of the call was $166. The customer service agent submitted a ticket for that amount to be credited back to me. I was happy. Then I called in December (from California after my move) and found out that my ticket was denied. \r\n\r\nComcast's reason for declining was I was supposed to check my bill. I am absolutely furious. When I returned the modem from Comcast back in 2011, I had a paperwork stating that I returned the modem and I made several calls to ensure they took it off the bill which they confirmed. After that, I let my auto-pay pay my bill and I did not care to check my bill every month. Comcast made an error. They added modem to my bill in April 2014. And now they are denying responsibility for their error and blaming for not checking my bill. It's like saying if the customer fails to check his bill every month, Comcast can get away with adding charges to the bill.", "Ordered internet on DEC 09. They said we can install it ourselves. Received it on the 11th. Would not work. Was told to come and switch the products. Exchanged the items. It still wouldn't work. Had to schedule a tech to come out. He came out on time and said it worked. I asked him to show me. He showed me from his phone. When my son tried to connect to the internet it wouldn't work. Called tech support. Was told someone else had to come out. Will be here before 9 pm. I called to see if they was coming. I was told by a supervisor that the person basically lied to me and they will try to come out in the morning. I'm like really I took off today and I was suppose to go in in the morning. He said \"I Dont know what time or if they will come.\" Mad is and understatement. They Dont care about the people who they call customers. I open my mailbox. I already have a bill for services I have yet to use.", "One of my checks that was written for the month of Oct. didn't arrive in time, so they called me and made me pay by credit card right away, so they wouldn't cut-off my service. So I paid it right away. Went to bank to try and chase down lost check. Well guess what? Comcast must have either found this check or it arrived late. So they went and cashed this check also, which should have made me good for the next month's billing cycle. Nope, I was wrong. They sent me another bill for $39.00 for a late fee.\r\n\r\nSo I called them and tried to speak with a customer service person, but she could barely speak English and kept repeating the same sentence three times. It didn't seem to sink in with her so I just hung up. The only reason I went with Comcast is because my dish service does not internet where I live. Also I thought that I had signed up for the $99. Triple package. Well this package that I bought turned out to be $142.00 plus change. Boy do they lie, shame on them.

I tried finding a way to contact comcast/xfinity directly to let her boss know what an outstanding job she did coming to my home and fixing my cable and internet, but couldn't find a place to do so. She made me feel very comfortable with her in my home and I was amazed at how well trained and knowledgeable she was. She went above and beyond just making it work again. She shortened our cords and switched out older connection parts etc. She was very sweet and spoke very highly of her job. I have not been that thrilled with certain aspects of service with xfinity, the price spike, glitches etc, but she made the fix so easy and comfortable for us, so much so that my opinion of this company has changed for the better. This girl deserves recognition and a raise. She really is a gem and Comcast/Xfinity are lucky to have her in the field! (Techs name was Brittany/Britney... north metro MN)", "2014 to Nov. cost per month 180.34. November called in and was offered same package for 139.00 plus 30.00 additional charges for modem and boxes. Dec, payment 143.63. I was assured the bill would be no more than 180.43, which fits my pension budget. I have missed no payments. Jan 136.00, Feb 175.00, Mar- June 190.43, July 191.00, August 189.00, Sept. 202.00. Called was told it was going to be my new bill. They offered the 139.00 package with total being 174.00, said it was a loyalty program and I was told it was for one year. I taped the conversation. October 246.00, called again, was hung up on twice when I asked for a supervisor. \r\n\r\nWas sent to the loyalty department where 139.00 package was reinstated per the person, named Jenny, works for Jeff. Nov 135.00. November I received my contract via email and saw it was for two years and the numbers did not match what I was told on the phone. I was told it would be corrected but it was for two years. I was told I could get out of the contract for 10.00 per month. I only use Comcast because it is a dominate in this area. Dec. bill 199.32, call again, talk to Lindsey where she tells me that all the representatives that told me that were wrong . This would be the third time everyone at Comcast getting amnesia when cost is discussed. \r\n\r\nI brought up the year contract of which I was told \"I don't know why they told you that.\" The same story I get every time I called. Comcast pays their people to lie to you, then sends you the contract in your email that doesn't match the phone call and causes you to have to call in at which time the supervisor will not talk to you. I have never missed a payment, but truly understand why consumers would not put Comcast as a priority to pay. Comcast is allowed to rob consumers and mislead them and their service is not stellar in any way. I now join the group of hate Comcast customers and seriously want to be connected to a company that knows what the truth looks like. If you know one please direct me. Thank you. ", "So I went online to look at local offers for Xfinity internet service to see what other deals they are offering (I got some sales flyers in the mail for Triple play with rebates or free tablets). I am only interested in internet service as we've gotten away from pay TV and stream with Hulu+ and Netflix. The offer on the screen (which I captured in a screen shot) said $49.99 per month for 12 month with a 1 yr agreement for 150 Mbps service. I click the drop-down and change it to \"No Term\" and the price changed to $59.99 per month for the first 12 months. I'm happy with the deal so I call in on the number from the flyer to set up the install. All goes downhill from there...\r\n\r\nThey tell me that is California pricing and I shouldn't be seeing that offer. They asked if I put in my address and I said \"no, it didn't ask me to.\" So long story short they won't honor what they have plastered on their website. Companies just have no sense of Customer Service anymore. I told them never mind and hung up. Guess I will stick with AT&T UVerse. I have my business service with them as well. I will be cancelling that later this month too.", "I called Comcast reference my poor Internet speed. I have already relocated my Comcast router 2 times and paying for both times, and both times having bad service. The cable work on the outside of my house looks like a 2 year old put it up.

Luckily I was smart enough to keep the receipt.

I'm supposed to have speeds at 25 MBPS but when I did a speed test, I was getting 76 KBPS. I can't watch movies On Demand either.

At the end of each month I went to the Xfinity store to speak directly with a rep. Each time, I was told my account would be credited and calibrated, but it never was right. Finally I spent two and a half hours putting all charges and payments into a spreadsheet to make the account crystal clear. I brought it to the store and again I was promised everything would be calibrated. When it wasn't, I again pleaded my case and was told nothing more could be done. Essentially, I was robbed of $60. After all the hours I spent going to the store, waiting in queue and talking to reps, I gave up because $60 wasn't worth personal and family time. Xfinity has a monopoly in high-speed internet in my area so they don't really need to do anything because we don't have a choice but to deal with them. Pretty sick.", "I called because of notice that I had reached my internet usage limit. I'd never heard of a limit on my account.

This was after 5 verifications and transfers and a hold time of over 20 mins.\r\n\r\nThen, they informed me I'd have to call back to discuss the account. I phoned back, waited on hold for over 45 minutes to be informed that I was not authorized on the account. What? I'd just been verified 5 times. The fact that we've added my name to the account 5 times doesn't matter. I asked for a supervisor and waited on hold for another 5 minutes only to be hung up on.

The circus continues till the line is disconnected. Then you have start at the beginning. I have had the technician come out three times.

When I called in they told me that they had no record of my previous conversation and that deal did not exist. On top of that, the person on the phone was extremely rude and abrasive.

After renting a Comcast modem for years, they purchased a new model (Modem-router combo) at BestBuy. It set up quickly and worked fine. Two months later, they were still being charged the monthly modem rent. After a phone call to get credit, the internet immediately stopped. After about five hours of Comcast blaming the new modem, the service began again. This month, the housemates see that they are still being charged so they called for the credit again. Immediately after the phone call, the internet service stopped. Comcast blamed the modem again and the service has now been out for about 48 hours. Phone calls are passed around and after telling the story, Comcast will ask questions about THEIR modem - obviously not paying attention or just playing mind games to prevent their own boredom. \r\n\r\nThe modem is sending a SIGN-IN page signal to any device which tries to access the WIFI. Putting in the name and password do not do anything. All their suggestions (unplugging, waiting, etc) do nothing.

", "Three times in the last few weeks the internet has gone down. Guess what Comcast? I work from home and NEED internet access to do my job. Having such outages is bad enough, but when you pay for the highest speed... that is what you should receive. NOT a happy customer at all, and I'm quite sure my boss won't be too thrilled either. So sick of your ads that state you have stellar service. It's all trash and you guys know it. I'll be calling in a bit to make you aware of my plight.", "Comcast is my ISP. Called for tech support and was sold a package that included higher speed internet access plus cable TV and 1 free premium channel, all for the price of $ 69.99 plus modem rental and tax. When I asked what the total would be I was told $83.00. I asked the agent to email a confirmation of what we had discussed, he said he could not. Got the equipment UPS which did not work. When I called for help they offered at no charge to send someone to replace non working items and add cables that were not included with the equipment. \r\n\r\nJust received an email confirming the appointment. Within email was an estimate of charges... $159.13. Just called Comcast and was told that they did not even have a package as the one I had been sold just days earlier. I cancelled this order, but I am waiting to see how this whole thing shakes out, since this is the 2nd time within a week that this company has grossly misrepresented themselves to me. Unfortunately, in my area they are the only ISP so I have no choice.", "I signed up for a one day pass with XFINITY when I was back in Boston. The password wasn't working even after resetting it so I called the number on the email. The customer service person forwarded me to the technical support person who then forwarded me to the Wi-Fi department who then forwarded me to someone that suggested that I call the number that I first called!!! After complaining that I was being sent in circles one guy tried to help by calling the initial number. Never got this resolved. I DO NOT suggest using their one day service. Find another carrier.", "First and foremost, Comcast is the worst company I have ever encountered. Why in the hell will they ask me to pay $119 dollars for internet and tv cable every month when I'm only getting a hundred channels. The internet connection sucks. Called them about increasing the speed and all I hear is some silly comments like ''are you using more than one device\". Ok so if I'm using two devices at the same time what does that have to do with your internet speed? Doesn't make any sense when I'm paying a hundred and nineteen dollars with low speed internet connection and half tv channels. These guys are so dumb as hell. What they should be saying is if multiple people living next room from you are using a wireless b device, that can slow down your internet connection. But no one tells you anything but force you to pay these crazy monthly fees.", "My internet stopped working. Called support and spent countless hours troubleshooting. Every new agent wanted to do the same tests. UNBELIEVABLE the lack of communication internally at that company. After 4 days, Comcast decided to sent a technician to check the modem. 6 days after I reported the problem, the technician arrived, did more tests and replaced the modem. All started working. To my surprise, the invoice shows up not with the 6 days credit but an extra $70.00 charge to replace the broken modem (that we rent from them). Of course, knowing how confuse they are, I called to complain. To my surprise, the supervisor told me that the charge is correct. Can someone explain to me why I am paying to replace a broken equipment that I rent from Comcast. Again, sign of a desperate company trying to exploit its customers while it can. Of course, not for long. I am cutting the cord.", "Worst company ever I have dealt with which don't care about customer satisfaction. I have had internet service with them since 2 years and have instructed them I won't like to have any other service with them but they still push the bundle in my account without my permission and then charge extra for me. When I try to return extra device at local office then they don't take it and give promise my rates will stay the same but guess what? Rates went up by $11. Then I complained and instead of trying to adjust they justified the new rates. \r\n\r\nOnce their technician comes out to service 15 minutes late then arrival time and by that time I have resolved the problem and already left for work. So the technician tell my wife that we won't get charged for it since he didn't had to do anything ant they still charged for $20. When I call them to reverse the charge again phone lady tries to justify the charges. I am so fed up with their service that I want to give up on them but I don't have any alternative in my area. I wish this Internet never have been discovered if such are the service provider I had to deal with. Totally rubbish ISP to have as Comcast.", "I so hate this company. I only hope for AT&T get to my area to leave it for good. I am even considering to move out to an area with AT&T U-verse high speed internet. I used to have unlimited internet - now Comcast have limited to 300 gb and have trained their representative to lie about it saying that internet plans were always up to 300. I know is a lie because I've always used way more than that. I have subscription to Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and Netflix. I don't use their cable service because is awful. I can get almost as many channel with an antenna on my roof for free and in HD. Your basic cable plan should be called \"blurred vision time or pay extra for the same.\" \r\n\r\nI only have a bundle package because they made me in order to pay less for the internet service (I didn't even unpacked the cable box) they are limiting the only thing I need from them which is the only good thing they have, and now they are messing up that too. The government should investigate this company for monopolizing the market and steal from their clients. The 300 gb limit is just another way to steal and rise the prices to make more profits. In my zip code is only Comcast so I think I'll have to move. By the way, their representatives suck. When they are caught in a lie they just keep saying it as if that were gonna make it true.", "***Published in another site <http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Billing/on-contract/td-p/2678883>***\r\n\r\nComplaint Type:Consumer to Business ComplaintNature of complaint:Contract IssuesProblem description:\r\nI called Comcast back in October, because I had questions regarding there new pay for unlimited Internet, when I got my first billed I called them, spoke to a representative aND I was told they would give it to me, then I got another bill, and again it was high, told my kid's they would have to get off, then 12/24/2015 I was fed up, I was ready to cancel, and was told my cancellation fee is $110 it was $10 for each month the contract was in play, so basically October, I said fine, the very nice lady as it seems said who put you on this plan? No no I got a better one that gives you unlimited, and she was great kept me on the, I kept thinking if this a contract change it's a deal breaker, she never mention no contract, and she service my primary needs was unlimited Internet I explained I had 2 kid's, so while going thur my email's I got a alert stating am over went on the chat, only to found out Comcast put me on another plan and I was in a 24 month contract and no unlimited Internet. Please help me get I feel like a little person in a ocean.Desired Resolution:Billing AdjustmentDesired Outcome\r\nI wish to get out of whatever contract they gave me and switch I know I'll probably end up with the same issue, but it makes no sense to be constantly lie to, and don't do anything about it. Our conversation never stated anything about 24 month! And billing adjustment.", "On Feb 2nd, Comcast technicians came to install our triple play system at 10:45 am. When they left at 3:40, they had the two set top boxes in the wrong rooms (Voice-activated box was in the bedroom, and the non-voice activated box was in the family room). Internet did not work at all. It is now Feb 10, and I fixed the internet settings myself four days ago on the ethernet connected computer, and did the settings on the wireless computers two days ago. They all now work fine, no thanks to the technicians. \r\n\r\nWhen the technicians were here, they could not get the family room set top box to work with our Pioneer surround sound, so they just used HDMI cable and ran directly to the tv (No surround sound). Today, I switched the two set top boxes back to the proper rooms and had the surround sound working within 5 minutes. I think Comcast could save a lot of money by firing all their technicians and letting the homeowners set up our own systems. I was in touch with the salesman last Friday explaining all the issues I was having, and he said he would get his supervisor and come see me on Monday. Yup, you guessed it, this is Wednesday and I have not heard a peep. Comcast just plain does not care about their clients. Be forewarned if you are considering their services, you will have many heartaches in your dealings with them.", "First, allow me to start with an issue that transpired on day one of my move. Before I relocated from out of state to Tennessee, I contacted Comcast Customer Support. Everything was pretty smooth at that point. I was told to simply bring the equipment with me to the new home, schedule connection date and time, and be there with someone over the age of 18. Wow! That is easy enough. Unfortunately, they did not tell me that I should not pay my bill. Comcast bills a month in advance. So, when my bill was paid, the money was tied up in another section of the company that the region I moved to had no access to. Long story short, it was about 3 months before the money was returned, sent to correct address, or placed on current bill, and to top all that off, I was told I was getting disconnected for non-payment. When, in fact, I had over paid Comcast by nearly $300, and they owed me money!\r\n\r\nNow, let us move on to the final straw that made my decision indefinite to leave this company and absolute, beside horrid customer service! In Knoxville, Comcast puts a limit on the amount of Internet a household is allowed to use. Once you've reached that limit, they decide to charge you a recurrent fee of $10 for additional Gigabyte usage. Imagine getting a bill in the mail for 100's, even 1000's of dollars, over your normal monthly bill because you used the Internet too much for Comcast's likings. I am not one that downloads a lot of files either. I simply stream Netflix, Amazon, and use PS4 functions. Yes, the PS4 downloads some large files occasionally, but as a customer who already pays an arm and a leg for service, I expect to be able to use it without being charged more. \r\n\r\nMy wife and children stay home during the day. So, with Netflix running for my toddler, that sucks up the data. We are now 3 months into our overage, and we are facing the outrageous charges of going over the allotted amount of Internet Comcast says we can use. Mind you, we already pay nearly $200 a month, but apparently nothing will satisfy the greed of this massive corporation. I hope Comcast enjoys missing my $200 a month, not including overage fees. I will be giving it to a new company servicing the Knoxville area, WoW! They have no limitations and are nearly half the price of Comcast in every aspect, including cable TV. Goodbye Comcast! Keep doing what you're doing, and you'll find that bad business ethics will only cost you more money as your customers keep leaving you.", "I called this company many times in regards to being overcharged, and finally, in December I thought these people had it all sorted, and I seen my bill of +45 then a week or so later I look at my bill and it is almost $400 after telling me I would be paying $131 monthly for the triple play. This company is a rip-off and one of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. The customer service, I just called, and finally got to talk to a human, and when I told her about my bill, she put me on hold without warning, and I am still on hold 10 minutes later. The customer service is the worst. I have endured trauma and stress as a result of being repeatedly raped by this crooked company and have paid well more than what their reruns are worth. Unfortunately, we are forced against our will to use this service provider. I hope one day in the near future someone will put them out of business, an honest company.", "Worked with Comcast for 4 months, and they run the most unorganized and unethical business practice. Paid to have phone line transferred, didn't happen even after 4 months! Internet service is \"16mbs\" down and 3mbps upload, which isn't even CLOSE to what we were getting in real world results. Our results? 7mbps down and 1.1 up when everyone is not using the bandwidth. You know what the tech rep said to us? \"You can always pay more for more speed.\" WE DON'T EVEN GET THE SPEED YOU SOLD US.\r\n\r\nHow in this day and age can we get Google Fiber (1 TERABYTE) download speed for $70, which is what we pay Comcast right now for internet service alone, and consider Comcast as a business who offer us \"value\". Short answer. They don't. Don't deal with them, don't deal with their customer \"service\", and most of all, don't waste your valuable time. The only other reliable internet service we've had is Charter, and we've been in business with them for 16+ years. The fact that I am going out of my way to make an account and write a review should explain how poor our experience was with Comcast Internet.", "My Internet has been and still is down since 2/17/16. Every day I call to check and I get the same message, \"Your internet is suffering a problem and it should be ready by\" and then depending on the time of day you will get a 2:30 pm, 7:10 pm or a 10:20 pm. Obviously none occur. On top of all that luckily I finally was able to get a hold of an agent who told me to call the billing department and ask for a credit, If I hadn't I wouldn't have received anything and even now I was credited till the first time I was able to speak to an agent which was 2/29/16. Since we are still with the same problem we have to call every day, go through the trials of automated answering to try to reach an agent (this is very time consuming) to get a credit.", "In November our promotion ended. I called Xfinity to see what other promotions were currently available and was talked into trying a bundled package with the assurance that if I was not happy, I could cancel the tv service and go back to just Internet for 39.99 a month for 25mbps. I called and attempted to cancel tv service and go back to just Internet for the price quoted as mentioned above. The representative told me I could not do that and 25mbps would cost us 69.99 a month and it was cheaper just to keep tv. She would not let me talk to a supervisor as I requested multiple times so I ended the call and called back a week and a half later when I was having internet issues. \r\n\r\nI spoke to a customer service rep who removed the tv service and upgraded us to 75mbps for the same price of 49.99 a month. I was ecstatic. She stated I would have to agree to a year commitment, I stated that was fine. I agreed to the terms of 75mbps for 49.99 a month for a year. I looked at our bill today and we are only receiving 25mbps for 39.99 a month and charged 10.00 a month for a speed upgrade?!? I don't even know how this is legal as these are not the terms I agreed to and we are being charged 10 dollars a month for services we aren't receiving. Comcast Xfinity is the worst company to deal with and totally scams its customers.", "They say that they have the fastest internet, it's lie. I pick the fastest package they have because I have multiple gadgets that are connected to the internet at the same time. Guess what, some of my items are never able to connect on the internet. One time I was on the phone with their customer service rep. more than 5 hours, but they were not able to solve the issue. I have a smart TV which was only able to be connected on the internet once... useless. I will never ever get them again, and I am going to tell everyone I know not to get them. False advertisement.", "I have contacted Comcast so many times I've lost count. By far one of the worst cable companies I've ever had service with and I wish there was another cable company that was available in the area, I would switch immediately. My WIFI is so slow I can't stream anything. Ridiculous how the modem is inches away and won't even allow me to connect to Netflix, or my tablet. Of course you contact customer service and it's so frustrating speaking to some of the reps. They have upgraded my WIFI so they say so it can be faster and better and I see no change. I finally got my own router and am willing to try that just so I don't have to deal with this company and calling in anymore because obviously they do not care about their customers. By far the worst ever... Shame on you.", "My modem is directly connected to my computer. I've had speed issues amounting to almost 5 visits from technicians. The customer service is impossible to talk to, and most of them aren't even from the states. I would switch from them to Verizon in a second if Verizon was available in my building. If you have a choice, do not choose Comcast. 93 dollars a month for speeds at 2.26 - 5.75 on the blast plan. The whole company is as crooked as government sanctioned organized crime.", "I would rate them 0 stars if possible. Spent 3 hours between Xfinity chat, and phone calls and each of the 7 different representatives gave me a different story. Was told that they could not reset public wifi hotspot, even though they did about a week ago. Was also told that they do not offer 2 separate one hour, free use of public wifi hotspot when I have used it before. Last Representative told me that the person that owned public wifi hotspot turned off internet access. My computer will not connect, but my cell phone does connect to public wifi hotspot with no problems. I work on computers and networks and explained this to all 7 reps and told them I just needed the wifi hotspot in my building reset, but was told they could not do it even though they just did it about a week ago. Even had one rep hang up on me. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely worst customer service. Would recommend any other internet provider, at least they won't have 7 different reps between the chat, and 3 different phone lines [(800) 934-6489, (800) 266-2278, and (866) 366-5756] each telling customers (aka me) something different. They also claim to offer 24/7 support, but one rep said I had to call back during normal business hours to talk to someone else to fix problem. If you enjoy being lied to and told whatever to get you off the phone then this is the service for you. If you want a service that is willing to actually do their job and offer customer support, then go with just about any other internet provider. \r\n\r\nThe reps I spoke with that I got names for are Savina or Sabrina (wasn't clear), Rene, Ella, Bill, and Ramon (on chat). I did not get the name of the first rep I spoke with and did not get the name of the rep that hung up on me. So in conclusion if you enjoy being lied to and not getting support for internet problems, then this is the service you want!!!", "I would NEVER recommend COMCAST to anyone. This is the absolute WORST COMPANY ever. I will be back with UVerse in a few months. When I initially set my account up, I spoke with a representative and they lied about when they would come hook my cable up so I was without cable for almost 2 weeks. The customer service representative lied about the cost of my cable bill as well. After 40 days of having service with them, my bill was right at $645.00. I called in over 10 times and asked why my bill was so expensive and I was informed that I was billed twice the first month but they couldn't explain the additional fees. Come to find out after doing research, they charged me an installation fee, which I was quoted FREE from the initial conversation. To top the cake of the horrible customer service, I just got my cable line buried yesterday (March 8th, 2016).\r\n\r\nI have had service with this horrible company since DECEMBER 20, 2015. They lied over 7 times about appointments that they would come bury this big orange ugly wire that stretched from one end of my house, across my driveway, to the other side of the house... Then they didn't call to apologize about not coming or try to reschedule. I had to call them and complain... Then the last time, they routed me to a supervisor in Mexico. I even went to the local store in Little Rock, Arkansas and they said someone would be there on a specific date (March 2, 2016) and they never showed up. I had to contact corporate office (which is the only reason my cable got buried) and she stated that they would compensate me $20 for all the missed appointments or either give me premium channels free for a month.\r\n\r\nThe entire time, I have received complaints/fines from my homeowners association and all I got was $20. This company is a sack of **, they don't care about their customers, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, liars, etc. I wouldn't recommend them if they were the last MFs offering cable on Earth. You would be better off looking at the walls. Needless to say, I will be returning to AT&T in approximately 2 months.", "I don't wish Comcast on my worst enemy!! I really believe they try to get customers and after 3 months when the contract is \"official\" this is when all the problem pops up. So I signed up with Comcast for internet and cable. I explained to the representative that I am working with a budget and I will like to hear options and best offer. Fast forward...the package I chose was $113.00 keeping in mind it was almost the end of the month and they charged me for the entire month. A week passed by. I got another bill for the upcoming month. Okay cool. I paid it thinking my cycle be said amount from now on. \r\n\r\nAfter my three months passed I got a letter in the mail stating that I was not charged for one of the boxes, therefore, they will have to add it to my bill. My bill went up to 126.00! I called to express my disappointment and disgust but you know the representative will be reading that script and keep saying, \"I am sorry. I understand,\" to me. No!! You don't understand!! We had a verbal agreement!! Anyway nothing was done on their end to make me happy. I paid my bill. \r\n\r\nNext month I got my bill. It was $139.00. I was irate. I called again. Same crap about increase and taxes, and the whole works. Next month was $169.00. Some guy said my service was disconnected and it wasn't. I paid my bill and the customer representative I spoke with said he will waive the charge. He assured me that he just did it and my bill will be $110 next cycle. Well my bill came around and it's $134.00. I called again and another rep is telling me taxes went up and blah, blah...\r\n\r\nWell Comcast never disappoint. I went to check my mailbox today. Got a letter stating that I've been provided high definition and was not being charge for it. As a result they will be disconnecting it on the 28th July or I can add it for $9.99. The letter was so unprofessional. No dates. It wasn't signed. It was very vague. As usual their customer rep couldn't help but just poured out a bag of crap and said to me they gave me the wrong box. These people cannot be serious. I wish I read the reviews before I signed up. As a result my advice to people considering going with Comcast: Please reconsider!!", "I went in to trade in my old DVR for a newer one. I waited for a whole hour before being called to see a service rep. She asked me what I was there for even though she knew full well what I was there for. I told her I was there to exchange my DVR. I told her I wanted a regular HD DVR not an X1. At this point all I wanted was to get what I came for and go home. I knew the whole point of keeping customers in there was to sell them more products. I cut to the quick and told her exactly what I wanted. She asked 'why, have you tried the X1 before?' Clearly trying to make a sales pitch. When I told her to just give me what I asked for her whole attitude changed and she became rude and sullen. \r\n\r\nStarted slamming things on the counter. She fished out a DVR set behind her and printed out a receipt for me to sign. I signed it and I was set. The whole encounter took less than 5 minutes. Why was I in there for an hour for a transaction that took less than 5 minutes to complete? I HATE COMCAST. Your customer service SUCKS! You pretend to be all about your customers but all you're about is the bottom line. You've closed most your service centers, left only a few open causing massive backlogs. You've outsourced your telephone service reps out to China or wherever the hell those people are. I know they're not in the US. You SUCK Comcast. I will definitely NOT be renewing my contract when it's up next year.", "I was a good customer for years. Recently, I called to move my service, as we were moving to a new house. Much to my dismay, I was told that Comcast doesn't service the area that I moved to, so, I was forced to get a different carrier. I was initially sad to lose the service, but there wasn't another option. I was told at that time that I would be receiving a refund check for 141.00 and some change. Ok. Great! Today, I got a call from their collections department asking for 98.00, due to the charge of an early termination fee in the amount of 210.00. WHAT??? So, I call Comcast (admittedly, I have NEVER liked calling them or dealing with their customer service department) and I waste about 45 minutes of my life on the phone arguing with them about this bogus charge.\r\n\r\nAfter several repeated conversations with their customer service representative, I finally got to a supervisor, \"Robert\". Robert offered to discount my bogus early cancellation fee by 50%. Now, that would be a great deal if I had actually broken my contract, but since COMCAST doesn't service my area, I don't really see how the break in my contract was on my end. I argued with Robert extensively about this bogus charge.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of intense conversation, in which they steadfastly refused to remove the bogus charge, and I assured them that I would spread the word regarding the business piracy tactics that they employ, I agreed to the 50% off of a ridiculous fee and will be getting a check for 7.02 instead of the 141.00 that I was supposed to receive. I would absolutely, under no circumstances, ever for any reason suggest that anyone go with Comcast for their cable or internet services. The service itself is nice, offering a lot of nice technology, but the customer service has been sorely lacking for the duration of my contract.", "This is the 2nd time Comcast/XFINITY has STOLEN money off my credit card. They took 2 payments a week apart. And try to give me attitude when I demand it back, then had the nerve to tell me it would take 3weeks to put it back on my card! Worst Company Ever! Moving to another!", "Comcast has by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered. We have had cable issues now for 2 days with no resolution. When I try to call them I am placed on hold for up to 15 minutes at a time or flat out disconnected. They are the most unreliable company I have EVER dealt with and I am cancelling any and all services offered by this sham of a company. Constant issues with reception, ridiculously poor customer service, and runaround. This is what you can expect from this company. I am sorry I ever signed up with their services and paid these people our hard-earned money. There has not been a single month I have not called them for a problem. They are horrible and everyone should stay away from them.", "I called Xfinity to troubleshoot my internet at 4 am 2/17/2016, got connected to someone who I swear came to this country on a floating door as I had to tell him twice I was outside and not near the router, had to tell him three times I was NOT going to set an appointment for a service technician as I wasn't going to pay $25 for that.\r\n\r\nHe tried resetting my router which did not work, and I eventually hung up on him, went on my phone to xfinity chat and was told again that there was no server maintenance (I don't believe that) but was told my router/modem through xfinity had device problems, got ready to set up an appointment for 2/17/2016 and as soon as was in the process of setting up the appointment my internet magically started working. It seems to me that the customer service technicians either don't know when/if there is server maintenance or that xfinity is such a money hungry company that they shut off internet just to get you to schedule a service technician to come out so they can rape you of more money.", "FALSE information given by agents... and terrible notetaking from these agents. Spoke with Jennifer for credit of billing and was not crediting my billing for the time period where my services were disrupted. She transferred me to a supervisor, Eve. Supervisor Eve did what she was trained to do and did not allow any credit, rather repeated herself as if it was a script. My television services and telephone services and internet services did not function as they should. Technician came out and resolved the issue after TWO+ months of service disruptions. ALL Xfinity services did not function as they should, ALL not working. At the time of the initial call and during the follow-up calls I was reassured that proper credit would be applied. Terrible way to do business as a big company.", "Horrible Internet speed\\service from Comcast! Comcast blast speeds are a small fraction of what they promise. I have a ethernet connection to the TV and can't even watch Netflix or Amazon streaming because the internet speed is so slow!!", "The Wifi is going back to dial up - call customer service - not only do they have no idea on the service but barely speak English - definitely call center is NOT in the United States. Frontier was 150 percent better. They sell you a faster wifi service but the signal is NOT there. I want to cancel but now I'm locked in by contract!", "I've had service at my current location for 3 years. I have generally been happy with the actual service but have continued to have issues with my billing. In three years my bill has went up over %25 and has happened $2-3 at a time although I have pretty much the same services/channels when I signed up initially. Last month my bill went up over $60 with no explanation. I called customer server and was told I had promotional price that expired. After talking with the retention department for over an hour, I agreed to accept a different bundle that included a phone so my price wouldn't go up. I didn't need or want the phone but agreed to avoid another $60/month. It didn't make sense but I refused to pay more or be locked into a contract.\r\n\r\nTo be proactive I went ahead and paid my normal billing amount so my account would be current. I got my next month's bill and it had a credit over almost $200.00 which made no sense to me. I called and was told that it was because of the service change and it would be adjusted next month. Two days later my internet service quit working. I called and was told it was a technical issue but I was skeptical. After spending most of the morning on the phone, they told that the order for the \"upgrade\" I got last month didn't go through because my modem was not compatible with the phone service and that they disconnected my Internet service by mistake.\r\n\r\nComcast has a practice of gouging customers by \"promotions\". The real goal is to increase the RPC or Revenue per customer which is a key performance metric and watched closely by Wall Street. Instead of providing real value they use trickery to continue to raise customer bills by small amounts over a period of time. They have a whole bunch of tricks including disconnecting channels and telling you that you were accidentally getting them for free and other nonsense requires you to spend time calling in to their customer service reps and when you hang up your bill has gone up a few dollars.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind spending time on the phone fighting to keep your cost contained and dealing with the most rude and pushy customer service reps I've ever talked to, Comcast provides a fine service. Ironically my service is fast and I've been happy with it but now I will never use them. I am an IT consultant and I never recommend them to anyone especially for business use. I am lucky enough to have competition on my street so I am going to give WOW a try. They can't be any worse. I'll leave a review for them once I am up and going and have had a chance to interact with their customer service.", "For over a year, I have repeatedly contacted Comcast/Xfinity about problems with their modem. I would lose telephone connectivity for hours. Movies streamed via Netflix or Amazon on Demand would freeze and stop playing. Finally, I completely lost my internet connection when the Wi-Fi function on their modem stopped working. A technician was sent out to my home, and he confirmed that the modem was broken, and he installed a new one. I then had to back Comcast/Xfinity down for attempting to charge me $50 for a new installation. I decided to check out getting a new service provider. Ten years ago, my phone and internet service provider was AT&T. They no longer provide service to my area. Comcast/Xfinity monopolizes my area. I cannot use anyone but them for internet and/or cable tv. I can, however, switch to another phone provider (at least for now).\r\n\r\nWhen customers only have one choice for internet and cable tv, service and reliability goes down the drain. Comcast/Xfinity does not care whether or not their equipment works. Comcast/Xfinity does not care whether or not customers receive the service they have paid for -- and look at your bill, you pay for service before you have even received it. Comcast/Xfinity does care about imposing price increases to satisfy their fat, lazy, rich investors. A customer use to get the first two cable boxes at no charge. Now, you only receive one cable box with your package. Comcast/Xfinity does not care that their customer service personnel are rude and ignorant. Why? We the consumers have nowhere one else to go!\r\n\r\nA monopoly can set prices at whatever it wants (called \"price fixing\"). A monopoly creates inflation since they can set any price they want to. A monopoly can sell inferior products (e.g., their modem). A monopoly has no incentive whatsoever to provide better service and products because there is no competition. This is a very sad situation. Due to systematic deregulation by our ineffective US Congress, Comcast/Xfinity has been allowed to dominate and control the telecommunications market. What happened to healthy business competition? I have decided when my contract with Comcast/Xfinity ends in March 2017, I will no longer have internet or cable tv in my home. I would rather go without these services. I refuse to give any more of my hard earned money to Comcast/Xfinity.", "Triple play for 99 is an estimate only. After they add in all their hidden cost my bill is 184 a month. Also a data limit of 300gigs is ridiculous - that's a binge Netflix session. Always freezing up and the customer service is unreliable to say the least. Was told I'd be moved to unlimited data free of charge and 2 months later a charge of 55 was on my account raising my bill to 240 a month. I recorded all conversations and stored them just for this reason. I contacted customer service 3 times to be clear no extra charge for unlimited data would apply to my bill but did the fact I had 4 of their employees on record saying no charge would be applied, no it did not. \r\n\r\nOf course all this happened after my 30 days in which I could cancel and go with another company so I'm stuck for a year with an outrageous bill and the worst internet available. I suggest you really do your research and ask over and over what your bill will be after all the fees they continue to pack on after you sign. Not pleased and I will cancel asap.", "Got to work on January 20th. Found out we had no phone or Internet service. Called Comcast, they said they are working on it and would be restored before 3pm. Which by the nature of our business is too far a stretch. Called them again at 3pm, they said they would be sending a technician out within an hour. I called them an hour later, they said the earliest time they have available is the following day the 21st, not in the morning, not in the afternoon but between 4 and 9pm. In essence they are telling us to come in and sit down for another whole day not able to fill prescriptions, customers cannot pick up their medicines because there is no register to ring them up or counsel them, we can not receive prescriptions from doctors offices because no fax, no Internet for electronic prescriptions, no phone was working. Tried to make them realize the damage they're causing to my business but that would not even move them to get us a technician. \r\n\r\nIf there is a star below 1 star that is what I would have given. Comcast does not care if they put us out of business, send all our customers to competitors but they are quick to send you monthly bills. I am really disgusted with this company and their lack of concerns for people's plight. I do not know how many customers we have lost to competitors in a span of 48 hours. What is the lifetime value of those customers? Only time would tell. We will start exploring our options too.", "I had a contract for 24 months, I called to see if I could lower the bill. They lowered by on 7 dollars. I had to call them about my security system and they informed me while we were talking that they had put me in a new contract for another 24 months when I lowered my bill. They never said anything about that! So I went above their heads and talked to Avery - he said he would get me out of the contract and give me it all for 161.00 a month for 12 months. Then I would have to call cause the bill would go up. I just found out HE PUT ME IN ANOTHER ONE FOR ANOTHER 24 MONTHS! WTF!!! Comcast is nothing but money grabbing liars.", "Every time when I tried to do troubleshooting via the Comcast/Xfinity Internet page I end up at this page/message: \"We're sorry.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\"", "I called last month to take advantage of offer for exact same services I already have for $59.95. It's in writing on January statement.

I pity anyone who has no choice but to use this company.\r\n", "Comcast is the WORST company I have EVER dealt with. I have been trying for 3 weeks now to get service with them, because unfortunately they are the ONLY internet providers in our new neighborhood! Unless we want DSL which is impossible since I need the Internet for my work. I keep getting the runaround with this company and no one is properly trained with the correct information. Then their agents you contact who are in other states such as Illinois or Mississippi who tell you they are going to follow up on how service is coming along never do. \r\n\r\nTraining of staff needs to be updated so that they are all on the same page instead of having techs who come to the house and tell you they cannot install inside because the cable hasn't been buried outside the new home and then contacting an agent on the phone who says \"yes they can install inside without the cable being buried\", or another agent who says \"oh, even if that tech had been on time he couldn't have done the work inside because the cable isn't buried yet\". All of this may have been avoided to begin with if the second agent I spoke with on the phone on June 24th had not dismissed my call telling her the house was a new construction to begin with and I was told may need to have line buried outside... \r\n\r\nTo top it off when a tech came out to bury the line two weeks later we are told that who installed the fire hydrant crushed the cable pipe so now Comcast needs to contact 811 so they can mark where Comcast can bury the line as to not bust any pipes themselves. They tell us it will take 24-48 hours to do so, which would have been July 7th or July 8th and then he (the tech to bury the line) would be back that weekend, July 9th or 10th. Here we are a week from July 6th and 811 STILL had not been contacted to come out. I know this because I called them on July 10th myself as well as just now. Comcast is the WORST company I have dealt with! So if you have any other choice in your area, take it! I know I would.", "I tried to upgrade my internet service but found out that I was only allowed to get the higher speed internet that Comcast offers if I upgrade and bundle services that I didn't want or need. Since I am of the generation labeled a \"cord cutter\" it seems that I am being limited on what speed of internet I can get by how much money I am willing to spend with the company. I don't need the Comcast TV service, but it seems that if I don't purchase it, I am only allowed data speeds up to 50 mbs. If I get tv, then and only then am I allowed to get the higher speeds of internet that are available in my area. \r\n\r\nAccording to the customer service rep, those higher speeds get \"grayed out\" in the system if I don't get a bundle package. This is a discriminatory move that should not be allowed. If the higher speed is not available then that is one thing, but I should not be FORCED to spend money on a product that I don't want nor need in order to get one that I do. The account is under Ashley ** my fiance. Any help getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated.", "Be prepared for a complicated, detailed and possibly faulty sign-up process.

I have been told for the last 2 years a credit would be applied backdated to the date the issues started, to the date of resolution and have received $60 worth of credit. For 2 years of bad service, I have lost a job and countless hours at my other job because of these issues and Comcast has yet to resolve the issues. I am beyond frustrated at this point as I have made countless phone calls and sent numerous emails. Clearly, nobody gives a **. I want this properly rectified and I want it done NOW.

Was not told correct amount so I cancelled & now I have to pay the bill that is 1/2 of my monthly check or have service terminated.", "This is an example of how Comcast have left their installation at **, Savannah.

You pay for a 75mega bytes speed, you get less than 30, you get upset and tired of calling them everyday and decide to buy your own modem and router. You mess up your speed even more and with on and off Internet connection and when you call them, they tell you it's your router (that are very new) or your laptop that is just 3 days old. I can't seem to use any other company here because Comcast monopolized the service here in Rockford IL.", "Had no phone or internet service for 4 days. Comcast gave me 4 appointments. Either no tech showed and I was told 2 of my appointment was scheduled unsuccessfully. Comcast reps scheduled the appt therefore it's their fault if the appt was scheduled unsuccessfully.

When my service is finally restored I called Comcast to get credited for those days I didn't have service. They only credited me 50.00. I was told earlier in the week it would be 20 for each missed appt.\r\n\r\nComcast is full of **!!! I missed out on hundreds of dollars in wages and they wouldn't even credit me what they said they were because their reps didn't put all the appts in the system.

Every month tell you it is taken care of and never is, till you are so frustrated you want to cancel your subscription and they tell you that will cost you over a hundred dollars to cancel. They have you by the neck. No matter what horrible service always goes down have to reset the box constantly. I wish that I had never signed up for this product. I have never paid a late bill in my life but this was considered late payments even after I had talked with customer service and it was suppose to be fixed - instead added up months of late fees.", "Comcast is by far the WORST cable company in America. They have the WORST customer service, the highest rip off fees, horrible customer service and fraudulent termination fees. The service is UNRELIABLE and they enjoy ripping you off. DO not sign up with them unless you want to pay high fees and get stressed out when you have irregular or no service for days, and they could care less. They enjoy tormenting you while you pay these exorbitant fees. I now have FIOS and have no problems.

They said they would refund me the equipment charge and a supervisor would call me within 24 to 48 hours.\r\n\r\nOne week later no phone call and no refund. I call back and they gave the run around again saying they would have to give a ticket number to a supervisor to call me and give me a refund. Still have not heard anything.

I recurve an email the night of the 21st saying my apt was set for March 14, 2016. That was not discussed over the phone. I call Comcast back and they told me that was the only time frame they had and it was scheduled. I immediately became upset because that was not the appointment I was promised. I was in my new apartment for a week and a day with no cable, no internet, no security. They installed ONLY THE CABLE AND INTERNET the following week. So in still looking for me why security to be installed.\r\n\r\nThey waived the fee for the security, and I was told I would get 10$ off my bill for 12 months.

Rewind back a few days ago, 8 March 2016 to be exact, I alerted COMCAST XFINITY of my pending move for 25 March 2016. After about 10 mins of back & forth with the COMCAST XFINITY representative, she finally confirms (confirmation #**) my cancellation of services for 25 March 2016. Fast forward to last night, 12 March 2016, my COMCAST XFINITY services (phone, internet, and cable) are completely OUT. I called the representative and she was totally baffled, asking me if I tried to reset it, how long it's been out, if there is a power outage in the area, and that she has to check with her supervisor if she can submit a service request. Ask for permission? She stated she would call me within 15 mins, before 8:00 p.m., to let me know what time my appointment would be. \r\n\r\nI received a call at 7:59 p.m. stating that there wasn't a power outage in the area, it appears there's a problem on the outside, and that the soonest they'd be able to come is tomorrow afternoon (13 March 2016) between 1 and 4 pm. This morning, 13 March 2016, I received a call at 8:00 am from a COMCAST XFINITY representative asking if my issue had been resolved; I informed her it had not. She acknowledged my answer then reminded me that I had an appointment for TODAY, a technician would be here between 1 and 4 pm. \r\n\r\nAs the clock approached 4 pm, 3:53 pm to be exact, I called COMCAST XFINITY to inquire about the technician. Well, they told me that they DON'T have anything scheduled for me, asked me if I paid my bill, and OH, \"your services were cancelled.\" Not only was I insulted, but extremely infuriated! I paid my bill on 6 March 2016, I kept a copy of the chat that I had with the COMCAST XFINITY representative about my cancellation effective 25 March 2016. That is when the marathon runaround began. \r\n\r\nFirst, the representative told me that he has to transfer me to new accounts because they'd have to be the ones that turn on my services. By then, my husband took the phone to find out what has happened. Talk about the ABSOLUTE WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! FYI, the representative during the Chat was Divya, I cannot recall the representative's name from last night's call or the 8:00 am call; however, the representative we spoke with at 3:55 pm - 4:38 pm was \"Art\" who admitted he was physically in the Philippines, and now we have his supervisor \"Nick\". My husband is now asking for Nick's supervisor...which Nick CLAIMS he cannot disclose the name of his supervisor. Really? \r\n\r\nAll I want is my friggin' services to be turned on!!! The same services that SHOULD NOT have even been turned off before 25 March 2016! My husband was transferred to the internet side of the house...CLOSED! WTH!!! I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER recommend this piss poor company! COMCAST XFINITY has false advertising AND their customer service is the ABSOLUTE WORSE!!!", "Comcast/Xfinity is by far the worst Cable & Internet provider ever. I completely agree with the reviews, because they are indeed accurate and this I know because I'm a customer who regrets signing up for service. I work from home and I'm constantly calling Comcast to report Internet problems such as: slow connections although I'm paying for the fastest and highest one that have. My modem freezes constantly and takes forever to reboot. My horrible internet is always disconnecting and saying that I have no Internet Service available and it's a complete waste to call Customer Service, because all that do is lie and give you the runaround. This is the second largest bill in my home which is ridiculous. I'm paying close to $300 a month for ** service that barely works...\r\n\r\nThe info on \"My Account\" is inaccurate. I was told that I had 12 days to pay my bill before service would be interrupted, so I was surprised when I tried to access the Internet to start my work shift only to find out that I needed to contact Comcast, because my service was temporarily disconnected. This has happened twice and on today, I turned on my TV to see a message from Comcast that I needed to pay $29.30 to restore my service. Are you kidding me, when I just paid $280.00 on Friday, April 15th...? Is Comcast that hard up for money? I would say \"Absolutely\" which is absurd. Make sure you always check the 'Bill Details' because it's there when you'll find extra hidden fees.\r\n\r\nWhy is there 9 different \"Taxes, Surcharges & Fees\" and there are 5 different \"Other Charges & Credits\" on top of a list of other things...? Comcast will double charge you and once you bring it to their attention, their answer is always \"You'll see a Credit on YOUR NEXT BILL.\" I'm thinking, why the next bill, when the mistake/error was on this one? If they do give you a 'CREDIT' trust and believe, they have recompensated for this by overcharging you in another area. Don't believe me? Check your bill!!!\r\n\r\nI think we all need to come together and start a 'Class Action Lawsuit' against Comcast/Xfinity. I'm definitely about to talk to a Lawyer, because I'm so fed up with them. You could be calling about a problem you're having and the first and only thing they're thinking about is: \"Would you like to make a payment?\" If there was another Service Provider in my area, I could guarantee that Comcast would have no business and this is why they feel like they can and is taking advantage of their customers. There are thousands of people who I talk to who call in to vent about their unhappiness with Comcast. What a hike and disgrace!!!", "As a software Engineer for ** I can tell you I know a thing or two about pack sniffing or middle man interception. This is 100% spying! I'm sure they are going to say it's an outside company that gives them their information. Here is the thing, there is not a request back from hosting servers. Comcast is intercepting traffic and creating pop-ups that make it very very hard to use your browser, there is a middle man when it comes to third party after the interception to try to prosecute innocent citizens like they are Law reinforcement. It's a tactic to bother or harass its customers into submission. I see that becoming a new standard for many business.\r\n\r\nNow let's get into LAW and our Rights as declared by the United States of America Bill of Rights and Constitution. These corporations are not Law Enforcements or a Court System yet they are acting as such even as a middle man. Requiring money and proof you are innocent while assumed you are guilty until you prove otherwise. I have several screen shots from a VM that shows Comcast blocking its competitors as so called Copyright alert. This guilty until proven innocent, injecting packets to the actual computer without consent or the ability to not stop \"during\" harassing browser blocking popup. \r\n\r\nThis is going to be a money maker for someone when you can be seen as a guilty person if another uses your internet, guest or not. If this \"Interceptor\" finds you to have broken a Law that you are actually not breaking, like visiting one of Comcast competitors and you are flagged for copyright alert. While not being law enforcement Comcast agreed to set up its own court system and penalties clearly stated on their website. Even if it's aiding the system they are still involved and it goes against our Rights as US citizens. ", "I signed up for xfinity Internet. They charged me for modem rental fees since day one when I clearly told them I don't need them as I have my own. I asked them \"did anyone come out here to set up my internet? Did you mail modems to me?\" They always say \"no I'm sorry, will change the billing and refund you\" and I always say \"thank you\" but I'll be calling next month as I Doubt this will be fixed. Same story 5 months in a row. After all of that waiting on hold and finally getting it fixed after 5 months I knew when I cancel my internet after the year I'll have more problems. \r\n\r\nI called them to not renew my internet after the year and told them I don't have any of their modems and not to charge me. They said \"oh don't worry you're all set, thank you for your business.\" I got a letter next week stating I owe $77.00 for modems. Several phone calls later they said they would take care of it.

My old modem that I rented from Comcast functioned perfectly well until Comcast switched to an updated modem in February (2016).

I have been with them for more than ten years now - always paid on time. (180 per month). I will contact the appropriate branch of government to help me and all others with complaints. I will be 81 in a couple weeks. I have been on the Internet since the early 90's. Have several websites and I need to work on a computer in any room of my home. This is unacceptable.

A salesman sold me on giving them another try since I was not satisfied with my internet service. He told me that install would be easy and the install tech would do everything. I let the sales rep know that I had two phone lines in my home and they both had to be connected. When the installer came, he said he knew nothing about a second line, and he didn't know what to do since both lines had to connect it on the modem. I let him know that the sales rep told me that the installer would run a new line if he had to. He then said they don't do that, and He would not do that.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it for a few minutes, his solution was to drill a hole through both sides of an interior wall and run a feeder line from the second phone line to the modem. UNACCEPTABLE! I'm fairly handy, so I got to work and ran a new line myself and added a new phone jack in the room near the modem. While I was doing this he was getting more and more agitated because of the time it was taking. Bottom line it... I ended up spending my time and labor to get the install done. The sales rep completely misrepresented what would happen on the install. The sales rep was very nice when he hooked me in. He said to just call him if I had any issues. \"I'm always available\", he said. Three phone calls today, and no answer.\r\n\r\nIt's just been a few hours, and all the memories of why I left them in the first place have come back. I'm ready to quit again.

First question was am I sure that my service is out. The customer service rep completely clueless said someone will come on Wednesday and said, \"I will call you back in a half hour.\" Do you really think that happened? So I called back after a hour and a half, \"Someone maybe can come out on Monday.\" Then I got a call from support to ask if my internet was working and I asked, \"Did someone fix the cut underground?\" and the rep didn't know what to say and just disconnected the call. That is some awesome service.", "I was recently told by a customer service person that when I am behind on my bill, that Comcast DELIBERATELY slows down my internet speed. Here's the thing: they are getting me coming AND going. I have bipolar depression and don't always catch problems with my bill. I can understand their charging a late fee OR slowing down the speed, but not both. Why? Because EVERY SINGLE TIME I have been behind on my bill, I have caught up. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Yet I receive NO refund for their decrease in internet speed. Where I come from? That's called Robbery.", "I was a Comcast customer for over 25 years. Within the last year I was waiting for Comcast to adjust my bill. They sent it to a collection agency for 327.50. I paid it off in full 2 days, later the balance was 0. 3 days later it said I was 189 past due. I called customer service and I told them how can I be 189 past due when it was sent to a collection agency and I paid in full. They said I'd have to pay it, I said no way. A month later they sent me a bill for over 500. \r\n\r\nI finally got a honest customer service person. She said I was being charged about 220 for unreturned equipment. I had a paper with the Comcast workers employee number showing I returned it. She did a little time researching it and notice another time they billed me for equipment I returned so if you took off the 220 twice and the 189 I would have a credit. I always return my equipment so I don't get charged for it. I tried for months for them to fix my bill. They said they would and never did. They never did so I refused to pay it for the last 10 months. I use a antenna. I miss my cable and internet but I'm not paying for their mistakes.", "And so it begins... I just moved down here from New York and had to choose a provider. I wanted to go with DIRECTV but of course my building is facing the wrong direction. So between AT&T and Comcast. I read reviews on Comcast service and AT&T internet problems. Choosing between the two is like choosing between a Trump and Hillary election, you are going to be disappointed either way. I choose Comcast. After several visits to the place to get equipment and the runaround to get it set up, my internet struggled to get going. They stated the wires are dead in both outlets and would need to send a tech to look at it (which would cost money). Now how would an apartment complex that is continuously full all of a sudden have outlets that are \"dead\"? \r\n\r\nI said no and that we would need to go ahead with it and they need to fix it on their end cause I'm not paying for a tech. (This was after I had to go there three times and wait over an hour each time.) Finally some \"magical way\" they got the internet to be fixed. Now the issues kept coming. On the third month I went to pay and saw that I was billed on the 10th of the month and then again the 27th of the month. How can I be billed for 4 months when I've only had it for 3 and on top of that I was charged a late fee. After several calls... Person 1 says it was a mistake, Person 2 says they do that now, and Person 3 says they're not cause they are only seeing 1 payment due but will remove the late fee. Oh how nice. Person 4 (the manager) says I'm only accountable for the 1 month but I now can see my upcoming bill, then how come I was charged a late fee? They don't know. Shocker!\r\n\r\nNow my cable issues are fun. Demand is terrible, breaks up all the time and freezes, as if I have a satellite from 1980 hanging off my porch. I had to restart my box several times. And then when I want to rent a movie they change my PIN every time. For the first 2 months no PIN then in the third month I needed a PIN. Called them, waited for 20 minutes to speak to someone. I asked them to remove the PIN. He said he can't so I make a PIN: **. 1 month later the PIN doesn't work. I call them, wait 20 minutes, again tell the guy the PIN doesn't work. He asks me if I would like the PIN removed? Say what now? This company is the most poorly run company I have ever witnessed. I count the days until I buy my house and can finally get DIRECTV. Stay Away!!!", "If you want a home Internet service, please do not pick Comcast for service. Why, they are a liar and cheat! I signed up home Internet from Comcast. They said there was $29.99 plus $10.00 for modem and its unlimited internet. Guess what, it cost me $134.99 month. Please be my advice, do not get hook Internet with Comcast, be smart ok.", "I have Comcast only because in my area there is only the choice of the \"two evil giants\", AT&T and Comcast which results in a stranglehold, illegal trust-like (monopoly) grip on consumers. Everything was working as well as could be expected (for Comcast) up until 2AM last Friday when my Internet suddenly went dead. My computer was receiving the router and modem just fine, all lights on as normal, but I could not open any web pages. Just an error message page from Xfinity.\r\n\r\nI called and I was told that my modem was \"end-of-life\" (Motorola Surfboard SB 6121, DOCSIS 2.0) and was no longer being supported, so it was REMOVED FROM MY ACCOUNT! THEY CUT ME OFF! I only bought it ONE YEAR ago. Hell, my cell phone is SEVEN years old and still works fine! I was told my options would be to rent a newer one from them or go buy a new one. UNACCEPTABLE for Comcast to dictate to me how I spend my money. Mind you, I am still paying for my Internet service, which I am not getting. A new modem costs $125. To rent from Comcast is $10/month. So If I buy one, it won't pay for itself for 12.5 months. By then, are they going to cut me off again and force me to buy yet another newer modem???\r\n\r\nFirst they told me they could not put the modem ID numbers back in my account by phone, that I had to drive across town to a Comcast store with my own modem and have it done there. After my threats of leaving Comcast for AT&T, they agreed to put my modem ID numbers back in my account and tried unsuccessfully to get a signal to the modem.\r\n\r\nAfter many aggravating hours over four days (I'm talking like full-time job hours!) I managed to get on the phone with a reasonable Level III Technician who told me he agreed that it should be up to the consumer when to replace their own equipment, especially if it was still working. He got the ID number replaced again, but still wasn't able to get it connected. Finally, I was scheduled to wait two days for 2 service techs to come out to the house to investigate my lines. But my lines were all BRAND NEW from the utility pole all the way to the modem, as I had replaced the roof on my house three weeks earlier and all the lines had to be cut and replaced (by Comcast).\r\n\r\nSO... AND HERE'S WHAT YOU ALL SHOULD DO. I filed a complaint with my State Attorney General Consumer Protection Division AND the same with the FCC!! I said it was fraudulent business practices to cut off paying customers from services in order to coerce them into renting or buying new equipment at Comcast's discretion. In addition, that since there are only two providers in my area, it is still not unlike an illegal trust situation. Apparently, the FCC agrees that I have a case. They immediately forwarded my complaint to Comcast.\r\n\r\nWithin hours, I had the \"Indian call center\" contact me to offer me a credit to my account and to attempt to restore my service at once. It so happened that the service techs showed up just at the same time. They found filters were installed on my lines and removed them, then they found that the ID number the phone techs put in was one digit wrong!!! I only repeated the correct numbers about 8 times! End of story, they got everything running. Speed test shows I'm getting 57 mbps while I'm paying for 75 mbps, but all you \"techies\" know that's to be expected. I may go out and buy the SB 6190 (DOCSIS 3.0) when I can afford the $125 - BUT THAT'S UP TO ME!", "Watching tv and the picture went off with an \"error\" message and number. I was instructed to call service immediately and give them the number. I did so, and was asked \"What does that number mean, as I never heard it before.\" I hung up and the next morning I went to the store to get a new DVR box returning the old one. I came home, hooked it up, only to find that this box did not work either. Again a trip to the store to get a new box and this one worked. Intermittent phone and internet service caused me to get 5 \"NEW\" (recycled, I'm sure) modems. Oh goodie, we were just informed we are getting the \"new'\" XFINITY X1 SYSTEM... CAN'T WAIT!!", "Comcast is blocking NBA games airing on TBS and ESPN via Sling TV that are also aired on Comcast Sports Network. This is illegal.", "I recently moved and ordered new service at my new address. Comcast sent a service rep to install my Xfinity box. He arrived within the timeframe that I had set and was extremely helpful in getting me set up. He was even so kind as to put on boot covers as to not track dirt into my house. We got set up and running on his first try and he was out within an hour. I've been using it for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Connection speed has been good and have not had any glitches in service.\r\n", "Upon turning on my computer, I had no internet service. This is a common problem with Comcast, so I paid no attention to it until later in the day when I still had no service. I called Comcast after going through their routine questioning, and was informed there was a problem in the area. I was told it would be fixed by 5 p.m. I requested that someone come to my home to check the problem out. They scheduled a person for the next day, (April 6) between 3-5PM. At 5.00 p.m. I received a text saying it was fixed. Of course, I still had no service. Around 8:00 p.m, I called Comcast again and spoke to someone in Columbia, who said he was a supervisor named Jason, who after the usual Comcast, \"I will help you\" and \"so sorry\" I again was told, about area problem. He in no uncertain terms told me he would call me back around 9.00 p.m. to see if the problem was solved. As I expected he did not call. \r\n\r\nThe next morning I called again, and was speaking to someone in Mexico and I insisted on speaking to someone in the United States. After waiting 15 minutes, I was put through to someone in Michigan. I again explained the problem, and once again told it was an area outage. (I had asked all my neighbors if they were having a problem and they all said no.) \"So Sorry\", was the answer and they are working on the problem. I asked if my repair person was still scheduled to come and she told me no, they cancelled it because it was an high priory problem outside of my home. At this point I was furious. I called again and finally spoke to someone who spoke English and would get to the problem and reschedule the appointment for April 6. At 5.05p.m. \r\n\r\nOn April 6, A Xfinity person arrives and tell me it was scheduled to go to my neighbor as his order said. My neighbor told him he was not having any problems but to go my house as I had the problem. When he came in he said he was not authorized to do anything since he had no order but he would call his manager and get permission which he did. After checking my connections in the house, he found nothing wrong. He went outside to check and went into the electrical room where the connections are and lo and behold someone had placed what they call \"a filter tap\" on my line with a yellow tag meaning a leak was discovered. The tag had no name, date or other explanation. That was the reason I had no internet. \r\n\r\nSo the repairman removed it and lo and behold I had internet. I was informed that someone must have placed the tap on my wiring. He could not tell me why. Comcast could give me no answers. COMCAST LIED TO ME FOR TWO DAYS. Why are they allowed to be a business monopoly??? I have no choice in getting other service in my area.", "After countless unpleasant, extensive and disappointing phone calls attempting to get to the root of my Blast Internet speed problems, being bounced from department to department, having my escalated calls cancelled and \"restarted\" multiple times, charging additional \"service\" fees, XFINITY rescinded the initial account credit offer citing that I, their \"Valued Customer\" \"called too many times\". I find it extremely disappointing and disheartening that this is what XFINITY calls customer service!", "I have had Comcast for 3 years and somehow I got signed into a 2 year agreement when I was told it would be 1 year. Ever since I have added internet and phone, this bill has been out of control. Not to mention that they bill you a month in advance for services you haven't used yet. I can't get any help on why there is an additional $142.00 on my bill monthly nor can I get help lowering it. Very unhappy.", "I usually comment on how much I hate Comcast customer service but today it is their ethics. My husband tried a speed test through Comcast -- 80 bits or whatever when on the phone with them -- because our internet wasn't working. Through a non-Comcast site? 20. How can they live with themselves? Freaking liars. Our bill has gone up $20/year consistently over the last three years for the same service. It is just so wrong. However, they are the only high speed internet provider in the area. Monopoly, anyone?", "They are the worst company to deal with for internet services. Avoid them at all costs. They told me one price, and I got an email for a different price. They told me that I could set up one way, and then told me I cannot do it that way. Their customer service is literally the worst I have ever experienced. If there was another option I would not continue services, but they are the only company that services my address. WORST COMPANY EVER. 100% do not recommend.", "I signed up for the triple play with Comcast in July of 2015. It took them until the end of September to have me fully installed, inconvenient but it works. Or does it? My cable is fine, my phone goes out (doesn't work at all) a few times and my Internet/WiFi is consistently inconsistent. There are multiple times when I can not get out to the internet at all. This stayed the same all the way until May 2016. During that time I made numerous phone calls (over 60) and spoke with tier 1, tier 2 and WiFi specialists. I had over 15 techs come out to my house and do everything from moving the modem to changing my cable coming into my home to adding filters to hard wiring my gaming systems. None of this worked, my internet remained up and down. I asked more than once why they didn't switch out the modem and was told it's rarely a problem. \r\n\r\nSo basically I was paying for a service that didn't always work and to make matters more frustrating, I was told there was no supervisor or manager I could speak with to discuss my problems until the problem was fixed. In late May I finally convinced them to switch the modem and bang it now works. Still not as fast as Verizon, but it works. So I call them to discuss what will be done for my months of crappy service. The tier one person is very nice and understanding and writes up a ticket to partially reimburse me for my bad service. She tells me it needs to go to management for approval - the same management I was not allowed to speak with when I had a problem. Management looks at my ticket and denies it, stating that the previous three months May, April and March my internet usage was higher than normal households. \r\n\r\nNow I have two teenagers who connect their phones to my WiFi, we have a gaming system, their friends are always over using the WiFi for their phones, I need to connect to the internet for work and school. So yes we use the internet and we used it those months. I asked to speak with the management who made this decision and I was told I can not. I asked them to simply let me out of my contract and let me leave their piece of crap company and I was denied that as well. I for one am tired of large companies thriving and making money off of us the consumer, who without us they would not exist. Once my contract is up I will never go back to them, ever. I beg you to do the same. Do not switch to them and if possible, leave them immediately. Thanks!", "We switched from regular Comcast TV to X1. They switched out our Modem at the same time and now I can not access my Emails for 2 days and guess what they do not have 24 hour customer service via Phone?

They can't help you when you need it the most. Big mistake.", "I was experiencing some technical difficulties with my on demand service in June. Technical support solution to this problem was to reset my box. After a couple of attempts they seemed to have the system up and running. The support rep asked me if I was able to access any movies. I said yes. He said \"you're all set\". This problem happened again in July. They redid the whole previous process again. Again telling me it's all set. In August my fiance called regarding an entirely different issue, went to automated system, told him his account balance was almost $500.00. We thought that had to be a mistake. After speaking with the billing dept we found out there was over 100 on-demand movies ordered in 1 month. \r\n\r\nI was really confused due to I had a lock on the service & a code would be needed to make any purchase. I did not give anyone this code. Apparently, when tech support reset my boxes it wiped out all of my parental settings. So, my 5 yr old son was able to order anything he wanted to watch. A little over 100 movies and episodes. I made 5 phone calls about this issue in the following 2 days. Comcast/Xfinity refused to remove the charges saying the movies and episodes were watched. The supervisor I requested to speak to never called me back. Finally I spoke to a rep that reviewed the account and got a supposed supervisor to approve a credit to my account due to our history not showing these sort of purchases before or any incidences like this. \r\n\r\nShe went on to say she would need to split the credit into 2 due it exceeding her credit applying limit. She thanked me for being a loyal customer and we hung up. Well, after making a payment earlier this week I come home to find my service interrupted. It was too late to speak to anyone at 9:30 pm so I called the following afternoon. Only to find out after we hung up after that call in August, there was a so called review which lead to someone determining the credits would not to applied to my account due to the movies and episodes were all watch. Even though their technical support wiped out my parental settings and told me I was all set. I am so dissatisfied with this whole experience I am returning my equipment. I will never be a Comcast/Xfinity customer ever again.", "Just over an hour with 3 different departments and supervisors and multiple holds on a Saturday to find out the movie I BOUGHT on Pay per view is malfunctioning.

There are so many complaints about Comcast it doesn't seem worthwhile to go into the details here as nothing ever improves so I am out.", "They jacked up rates without informing us. Then reaching a live agent was nearly impossible, as the prompts kept guiding us to upgrade our service or add new services.", "First off, I've been without internet for a week and on demand for a week as well. So I call the second day after nothing worked the first day to schedule a visit and the automated system kept saying that there was an outage in my area and it'll be resolved by 12:36. So I call later that afternoon and tell them and they try to send signals to the modem or whatever and it wouldn't work. So we scheduled a visit for that Friday between 10-12. Mind you that the first option they gave me was for the following freaking Monday and I said HECK NO that is way too long, I have a business to run.\r\n\r\nSo the guy came on Friday at 1:30 NOT between 10-12 because I saw him pull up, he sat there for like 20 minutes and when I looked again he was freaking gone! So now I'm a little hot, so I call and ask what the heck is going on and why'd he just leave and the lady said, \"Well there's another outage in your area and he wouldn't have been able to do anything but he should have at least came to your door and told you but he didn't\". So later we rescheduled another appointment for Sunday between 3-4 and confirmed it.\r\n\r\nSo I don't go to church. I'm here waiting on them to come and it's 4 and all call like, \"Where are you guys?\" And this lady on the phone tells me that it has been rescheduled for freaking Tuesday! I'm like WTF! Seriously! How the heck can you just do that?!! She said that after further checking for like 10 mins that the local office called to reschedule but no one picked up so we couldn't confirm. I was like, \"But you just said it's scheduled for Tuesday so how the heck did you confirm that if no one picked up?\" They didn't call by the way. So you just don't come?? You cancel it on your own and don't freaking show up?!! She said \"yes ma'am that's correct...\" So I'm pissed by now and then she says that someone will call me back by 6 with a rescheduled... No one has called!!! This isn't the first time something like this has happened... But I can guarantee it'll be the last... I'M GOING WITH DIRECT!!! \u270c", "It seems that their system is not robust and actually quite fragile. Each time it rains the cable internet service goes out and it takes days to fix. They must not know how to learn how to make the service reliable for some reason. I'm running two businesses and Internet trading and can't do anything when service is out... using a phone is not a good option. For a company this big, it's surprising to me that they can't get a handle on robustness and reliability.", "I've been calling every day to dispute my bills for 1 month. I got charged for almost $500 for early termination fee. Thought it was a mistake. I called a Comcast rep the same day. She told that I was under an contract for 2 years, which I've never agreed for, and she told me that the fact that I cancelled it within a month she can remove the Early termination fee. She told me she removed it the same day. I checked a week later, it was still here. I called again and they told me they will call me back in 48 hours and they never did. Every time I called they keep on telling me the same thing for the whole month. I am so pissed for what they did because I've been a great customer for almost 10 years, always paid my bills on time. I am so ready to get rid of this horrible company.", "This review is about the Xfinity internet service we currently have. We signed up with Xfinity 2 months ago as we left AT&T. That was our biggest mistake for the year 2016. Indeed, at the time we were signing up, nobody made us aware of the 300 GB limitation. Xfinity will allow you to go over your 300 GB 3 times as a \"courtesy\", and thereafter you will be charged $10.00 for any overage of 50 GB. The people at Xfinity I talked to over the phone today were very uncomfortable explaining this to me. One of them (a manager) even told me that there were no limitations to the use of the internet (300 GB do not sound like a limit to him). He also said that AT&T has a limit of 200 GB which was very inaccurate (we left AT&T 2 months ago). The Xfinity individual I talked even tried to sell me a deal of unlimited internet if I agreed to pay $35.00 more. I will tell all my contact about this highway robbery, and very funny way of doing business.", "I had a plan with Comcast only for the internet, high speed blast. I ran a internet speed check to see how fast it is, as I was noticing slower and slower internet connection. It was the very minimum speed, at 0.61 mb/ sec.... unbelievable... and my plan was for high speed blast internet speed. This is theft! I was paying for a high speed and what I was getting was not even 1 mb/ sec. Comcast is a joke. Check your speed internet from while to while. Also the customer service is very bad too.", "I am unable to comprehend how this company has survived with the poor communications skills within the company yet alone to the consumer.

I have not been told the same \"truth\" more 2 times out of all these calls. They do not even know the procedure when you have to disconnect from another carrier. \r\n\r\nFirst you are told they will do it, then you are told you must disconnect. After that they tell \"oh you have to tell them you want the phone number ported.\" Too Late!! The phone is already disconnected and now you have to pay to have it reconnected, wait 3 days and then it can be ported to Xfinity. Then they go back to we get the phone disconnected. I have already been without service for days and it looks like it will be at least another week before anything is resolved. Also note the representatives are in the Philippines- they farm out the work from America. I am so disgusted. The grass was definitely NOT greener. I would rate them in the negative if I could.", "All of the negative reviews you read have common themes. Comcast was great for the first year. Increased the Price the second which was never disclosed. Increased again the third year and again when I cancelled. Every time you talk to someone they are reading a script and don't answer your question or understand what you are trying to get resolved. They answer everything with \"I have a promotion for you\". I never get angry but after a month of trying to resolve our problems and being lied to over and over again I lost my cool and hung up. So done.

They couldn't activate it for over a week later and wouldn't give us a time window. The day came and went and no call, no email, no internet. Now we had to wait 3 more days. Again no time window.

When I have gone to check my Comcast email, I have not only not been able to get to it, they have flashed a message on the screen \"unable to connect - server has been changed\". If this is not straightened out by the end of my commitment, I will be changing providers! I never had any issues until they started \"X1\". When I complained about missing emails completely for over 2 1/2 weeks (I have a digital newspaper subscription) a customer service rep had the audacity to tell me my missing emails, ON THEIR SERVERS, were due to the inside wiring in my home!?

The tech shows up after getting lost only tell us that he had no DVR box on his truck and in fact had no idea that that was the reason for the visit. My wife told him to go get out and go home. Apparently he contacted his supervisor who told him to use whatever he had in his truck to replace our unit, which he did. That did not work and he told us he had to go get the correct unit and would return shortly, that was over 2 hours ago and no sighting so far. So we called Comcast to find out what the deal was and we're told that they were looking for him but he was MIA, his department was closed and no one was available.\r\n\r\nThis is a chronic problem in that after calling, waiting, being put on hold, no one ever reads the notes, so when they arrive for the appointment they are clueless why they are even there.

One of the technicians who came to my house broke my TV stand and let it sit on two speakers to keep it upright... I didn't notice until a few days later... Can you believe that?

More problems with Xfinity in 15 months than Dish network!!! Do not recommend Comcast to anyone!!!", "It's slow and unreliable. I am so sick of it.", "I signed up for internet and was told I would be able to use wifi until my modem arrived. My wifi wasn't working and then when I called back they told me that I was signed up for the wrong plan and that my original plan was no longer available, did I want to continue service for another $20 a month... So I canceled.", "$700 bill. Really! If I could not give any stars I would. Change from AT&T to Comcast, worst decision ever. Only my child of 4 years, my husband and I use it. We barely home. And my husband only use when he has to check his laptop! That is just ridiculous! Please don't trust Comcast that's all I can say. ", "We got Xfinity on the first of July 2016. In the first week and a half, our internet was out, hours at a time, every single day. The first rep that was sent out to fix it said he didn't feel comfortable going in our crawl space so he told me I should reschedule another rep to come out. When I called to reschedule another rep, I learned that the rep that had been there that day, put in his notes that he changed out the splitter and fixed the problem. A couple of days later I had another rep come out with a trainee. They ran a bunch of test, but eventually fixed the problem... until I decided to add tv and security to my package with XFINITY. BIG MISTAKE!! With Comcast/XFINITY everything works off their internet. Cable and security all work off your internet connection. It's the worst setup I have ever encountered. If your internet goes out, not only do you not have internet, but you no longer have cable or security. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I added the cable and security package a little over a month ago. In this time, at least 2 days out of the week I have gone several hours at a time without internet, and thus, without security and cable as well. The last couple of nights have been the worst! Yesterday internet went out sometime while I was at work in the morning and didn't come back on until after 9 pm last night. Then it went out again sometime in the middle of the night and hasn't been on since. It is now 10:37 pm and I'm still without the services I pay for! XFINITY field tech are some of the worst I have ever encountered. When the tech came out to install cable and security he sat on his phone the whole time talking on the phone with buddies. I was suppose to get a Dvr box. I didn't get one. \r\n\r\nAs for security, this bozo sets the door that he put the keypad next to as a door that never gets used, or as they like to call it, a sentry door. I didn't realize that until I tried getting out that door, a couple days later, and went to set the alarm, just to realize that I could not set the alarm from the inside because it would automatically set the alarm off. I had yet another tech come out 4 days later. This tech fixed the problem and in the process realized that a lot of the way my internet, cable and security was wired was not up to code. So he proceeded to \"fix it\" and in the process did something that started my whole very unreliable internet process again. \r\n\r\nI had another tech come out 3 days later. He checked wire reliability and ensured that all cables were connected tightly, both inside and outside. He even climbed the power pole. He said he found a loose cable, which he tightened, but just to make sure he even dispatched a bucket truck. The bucket truck arrived about an hour later. He went up the pole checked connections and came back down, just to tell me the same thing the previous tech told me. \r\n\r\nIf I would have known this was going to be such a headache, I would have settled for a slower speed internet, paid a little bit more, and went with AT&T. I have had them before and their reliability was a million times better. The main two differences being AT&T works off of a dedicated fiber optics line where as XFINITY/Comcast is still working off of ancient copper wires. And none of AT&T's services piggyback off of any of their other services. They're all separate dedicated services, whereas All of XFINITY services rely on the internet connection. If the internet goes out, everything goes out.", "Outraged, that it should not take a month to get internet service! We contacted Comcast the 1st week of October for internet service. We was lucky to have a tech come out the same week. When he came he informed us he could not do the installation due to our residence being brand new and there wasn't any type of line of cable to set it. We was told he would have to call a special tech to schedule a date the week after for him to do a burial for a line. \r\n\r\nThe next week came a different tech came out said he couldn't do anything cause there needed to be a burial for the line. We told him the last guy said that and really we thought he was here to do the burial. He told us he was just a guy to set up installation for the modem. He informed us he would drop a line for this special tech to do a burial line and we would soon have our internet up and running by the next week. The same day our neighbours apparently was getting internet with Comcast as well. Their tech stole our line to hook up their internet and cable. We called the tech that came out that day who dropped the line and told him what happened. He ensured us it was ok and the special tech would drop another line when he comes out for the burial. \r\n\r\nThe next week came Monday the tech was scheduled he never showed. We called Comcast. They told us they got behind and someone would come out Tuesday. Tuesday morning a tech came by told us he couldn't do anything. We needed a burial. We told him our story. He called his boss and told us there would be someone to come out to do a burial that same day. Well no one showed up. \r\n\r\nHere it is Thursday of the same week. I was on the phone with Comcast for almost 2 hrs this morning for them to tell us there will be another tech out on the 31st to a burial and set up installation and he is sorry he's just trying to give us options. Well the truth is there is no other options. No other internet service will provide us with service because of Comcast being in our area on Murfreesboro, TN. I'm stuck with Comcast. \r\n\r\nI have 3 children with game systems, phones and tablets. Not to mention now a days schools are switching to Apps for kids to do their homework on. Internet is becoming more of a need and not a want. So if it wasn't for my children I wouldn't be getting Comcast. And if there was another service I could get I would definitely be without Comcast. I've had their service in the past. The worst part about having them is their customer service. The bills do tend to go up in price without them informing you and I've had our service not work at times to where I had to reset the modem almost everyday. They need to do a better job with handling issues with customers that's spending money with their company.", "Unplanned, unexpected, all day outages, rude service reps. Rearranging my day to set up service only to deal with a totally inept technician who has to call for backup on another day. I could go on, but why? We are dropping this failure of a company and relying on hotspots from now on.", "There is a malfunction on the DVR manager which is preventing us from adding more recordings. Customer service is fairly certain that the problem is from the signal from their system to ours, but protocol demands that they access our home before investigating that option. Since we work, that cannot be done until next Saturday. Customer service tech agreed that this seems illogical since logic would dictate that one would investigate the most probably malfunction first, but insists they must follow protocol. This is extremely frustrating. After 35 years as a customer of Comcast & their predecessors, I am investigating alternatives.", "Thank God. I am changing to Dish. They gave me awesome pricing and super people to deal with. You can actually understand what they are saying. I'm so excited to finally be able to return this equipment although still haven't received the home security yet as promised 4 times. Go to h*ll Comcast. You have made me miserable and cause me to miss many hours of work with your promises.", "I've had the worst experiences so far since install on 10/4/16. Nothing but problems. Two no shows on scheduled service appointments, extreme difficulty in adding boxes to the second floor. What is so difficult about adding boxes to an existing account? No thank you, I'm not starting a second account for the second floor of the same house! A separate bundle package? All I wanted was just to add a few boxes. Apparently this is not possible. Well then, I guess it's not possible to remain a customer!", "Very dishonest. Cancelled my service and they kept charging me for 2 subsequent months. Called and they said \"refund check in the mail\". Refund check never arrived. Called again 3 months later (after the 2 subsequent months) and they said I had early termination fees (which is never listed on the bank account summary-only the two monthly charges are listed). And I was not even under a contract. Just keep making up fees to not issue the refund.", "Their internet is spotty at night. Their customer service is rude and they don't care about anything but a paid bill. I switched from Verizon to them and I can openly say that Verizon is worth the money. You get what you pay for and Comcast is cheap and bad!!", "The service is garbage, much like the competence of the representatives. Here's my story. First, they changed my billing cycle to make it 3 weeks earlier than when was initially discussed, and naturally this was without warning. So of course I'm confused when my service gets shut off. When I call to straighten this out I find out they bounced the last two checks I made out to them. I decide to cut my losses, pay the balance, and I return their gear the following week. I instructed them to send me the final bill for that week of service. Instead, they send it straight to collection. With the wrong amount. They want almost $50 for that final week? Talk about being bitter over losing a customer. So now I have to deal with this and all of its obscurity.\r\n\r\nComcast: I will be disputing this. My bank statements prove what you're doing is extortion. I wonder where you came up with this magical number. No, really, because it's made up. Mess with my credit again and you can expect a lawsuit. And anybody reading this: I advise you to stay far away from this joke of a provider. Not cause I'd die for Verizon or anything like that but because of what's been dealt to me.", "We pay on time. We pay a lot of money. We HAVE HORRIBLE INTERNET CONNECTION. Intermittent, slow, terrible. We call the company to attempt to get it fixed and they do nothing. They have horrible customer service and literally offer no helpful solutions. They are robbing us. It's insane. yet, they have a monopoly on internet service in our area, which is even more frustrating. I just lost an hour's worth of graphic design work. I work from home, so this is especially frustrating. AVOID THIS HORRIBLE EXCUSE OF A COMPANY AT ALL COSTS IF YOU CAN!!

From paying $50 a month it's gone up to 100 a month and I only get my internet working for less that half the time. Plus yesterday one of their agents shared my personal information with a family member that's not in my account. Which I believe is illegal. I'm the only person on this account but they thought it was ok to share my information with another person.", "They demanded over 100.00 dollars for service which they could not provide upfront. Now they are refusing to refund that money. They are not to be trusted and I am now calling the BBB. I gave them this money in good faith to install internet for my son. Now they refuse to refund the money that we had to put onto 2 different credit cards. I have been going in circles now for over 2 weeks. They promise we will have it within 48 hours and they lie and do nothing. The money was all my son had and chose to go without a lot to get service. Now he has not only no food or way to get around as he is disabled and Comcast keeps his money. They talked to me 4xs with no problem. Now today they have an issue?\r\n", "A couple years ago we had a few service issues with Xfinity and as recompense they upgraded our service from basic to HD for free. It went away without any warning and when I called and asked why, was told that we weren't paying for it. Told them why we were getting it and the response was that there wasn't anything noted on the account.", "I don't even know where to start. Well I got Comcast internet hooked up in 2012 and besides little issues I never had a problem UNTIL March of 2015! I have had about 30 modem/routers hooked up in my home always the same continuous problem. Speeds are fine, 0 packet loss, but the one major problem is my ping times are reaching 200-300 ms at random times. It took me 3 calls to corporate office to finally get their ** moving last June and it took them up to the end of October to finally find a massive noise (SNR) issue in the lines. Since Nov 8th of 2015 my cable internet has been garbage. I cannot play any online games on the Xbox one, ports opened, tried DMZ, tried everything you could possibly think of including spending $800 of my own money to buy the best modem router combo, still didn't work. \r\n\r\nI filed a complaint with the FCC and Comcast said they did everything possible to help me. Everything? Yeah not really. If they did everything I would be able to play with lag-free gaming with 170mbps down and 12 mbps up. The higher-up guy at Comcast sent me a letter stating there's nothing else they can do, so what am I supposed to do now? It is the only ISP in my major area besides Verizon DSL and who wants 2mbps dl that's terrible! \r\n\r\nAs of today June 30, 2016 I have just hooked up their brand new Arris gateway and running constant tracer routes and ping test and am still seeing ping going as high as 350ms. I contacted corporate office today and they said basically \"you pay the money, we do nothing to fix your issue because our techs ran a speed test\". LMAO a speed test WOW! These people just ** on you and they don't care! They did offer to send another tech to run a speed test but I would get charged if they didn't find anything. So I'm basically stuck paying for blast internet and can just search the web on my laptop. Awesome, I got Comcast screwed.", "Where to start... I guess it's due to the monopoly that they have no reason to service customers. I moved into a Xfinity-only area and after 2 days, I could not be more dissatisfied. I've experienced no less than 5 errors, 2 related to channel lineup, 2 related to erroneous overbilling. (It's never underbilling is it?!) The most hilarious tale of incompetence was when they added a $10 charge for a rented modem when I added channels and I called to ask them to remove it as I own my own modem - instead of removing the charge, they added a second charge just for kicks. (As if I had 2 rented modems!!) I called back and the agent this time said he can't authorize it and he's submitted a ticket which will take 7-10 days to correct. He also suggested I call back before 7 days because 'this process isn't perfect!' I wish I had any other option than Comcast but they have a monopoly here. About time that changed.", "We have been a long standing Comcast customer. First it was the double billing. Tried to arranged the cycling time frame where it would fall at a different time frame did not work. Second issue was the phone - it suddenly cut off in midstream of a conservation. It kept happening and they kept trying to fix the issue so we decided to upgrade our land line phones. And last the past two weeks there has been numerous outages in the zip code 38133 so patiently waiting for service to be establish on. Yesterday June 4, 2016 - it took four hours, 4 - 8:5 pm and was notified via phone the service was back on. Got to check and guess what? Partial service, phone and internet but no Network. \r\n\r\nSo as of this morning I do not know whose internet network service I am using! It was stated by two technicians it was the modem it is outdated. Well it was working prior to low but working! We receive a notice a few months ago to upgrade via XFINITY site to receive a new modem. Never could get that to work, tried several times! For an additional charge the Technician could come out and make the switch. I feel it is up to your company to supply new uncharged equipment not the customer. \r\n\r\nNow I have to make a trip to the satellite location to turn old modem for a new! Since I had a minor procedure on Friday was not up to traveling but now I must! The phone and two IPADs is connected to my Network so only the main computer is operational. This was incompetence at the highest but I must give credit to the agent since he was insistent on selling me a package. Could you imagine if I had bundle everything with you I would have no electronic service this morning! I will no longer be Comcast customer. This is the last straw! ", "I hate Comcast. I have been a customer for over 5 years now. I HATE them. We have been having issues with the internet intermittently going out on us since we moved about four years ago. I call them and they do a quick fix (a week or so before the problems come back) and they always say that it is the old modem or router. We replaced the router multiple times and the modem is new. Something is obviously wrong with either the lines or just Comcast in general.\r\n\r\nThey won't fix the problem. The only other option in my area is AT&T, but the installation costs are expensive. I am about ready to just cancel Comcast and go back to the dark ages. I am THAT angry. I am SO FED UP. There have been some customer service reps that were as helpful as they could be, but, obviously, this is an issue that Comcast has and just refuses to resolve. If you are considering Comcast, STOP.

I dislike Comcast more than any company I have ever had to deal with. For such a simple task as resetting a password they actually have no clues on how to help a person with this. I can promise you I am going to dump these clowns as quickly as I can. They promise you the world to sign you into a 2 year contract and then can't even help you reset a simple password.

Numerous times we have had service outages that have lasted for days, whenever we engage to correct we get transferred around numerous times.\r\n\r\nWell on November 28th I contact them to request to discontinue our services as of December 10th because we had sold our home and were moving to an area where Comcast services are not offered. UPON the first 2 minutes after the initial call I was transferred and again had to authenticate myself and our account, after already completing that authenticate with the first representative. The person identified themselves as Dom and again I shared what I needed and he zipped through rushing me off the phone without providing a summary of the request or a confirmation. As he was attempting to rush me off the call and close it our cable service stopped working IMMEDIATELY. I ask him to slow down and correct this issue. At this point I am sincerely annoyed.\r\n\r\nHe transfer me to technical support without any handoff or notice, can you say I am so irritated. Again, to a different area where we had to authenticate yet again at this point they can not locate the last 4 digits of the primary account names identification.

The two previous incompetent people used the same digits and it was found and confirmed. Now they can't locate our account.\r\n\r\nReally, I just spoke with Dom who had now officially screwed up my account and services!!! This person proceeded to try to assist but to no avail. After 32 mins on and off hold proceeds to tell me how terrible her counterpart is and that I should complain about this Dom because he was terrible.

She went ahead and said, \"we can credit half.\" I said, \"Ok we can do that.\" I asked \"so how much is my bill now?''. She said 116. That is not half off the service man. That's just 25 off. They told me it was 99 for the service man and she said that service man was $50. \"Sorry again for being misinformed.\" I'm just holding on the line.

Each time we go through the same routine; reset, reset, reset. \r\n\r\nThe last two came up with some new things to do that I really don't understand. No matter, it still would not work.

I have finally demanded that they send out another Xfinity technician to replace this modem. A hint that it is defective is that it has a battery backup for power outages. We had an outage, I was right next to it and it did not work. Modem or the battery? I don't know. If they actually get it fixed this time and it works for a month I will update or write a new review.

They offer a fitness channel for $2.99 but it actually costs you $30 a month with a minimum of three months and they will not reimburse you at all. Their customer service is awful and very condescending. Quality on streaming tv shows is very poor.", "I pay for the top tier of internet in my area which is 120mbps. I am happy whenever I can get over 80mbps. Most of the time I am averaging around 5mbps on a wired connection. This is without their hotspot router. Currently I have 2.88mbps coming in hardwired. According to them they have no control over this. This is unacceptable. How is it that the cable portion always comes in perfect but your internet on the same cable goes in and out. Then they want to charge $50 to send someone out to look at the problem. Too bad they are the only option I have available to me as I am in an apartment. This is the definition of a monopoly.", "When testing speed on Comcast/Xfinity in morning it's 2.60 Mbps and at night it's 1.59 Mbps upload. Download in morning it's 5 Mbps but not enough to stream Netflix and it should be and in evening it's on from 8:30-9:30pm and OFF every night, the download speeds are 1.4 Mbps. There is no reason for such bad speed as I live in the city near the access wi-fi points. They charge you for 10 Mbps and you never get that speed. We have it set up at 405 and I am in 407 a tiny house, two bedroom, duplex stand alone house. CS just hangs up on you and they cannot help you. They blame it on where your modem is placed and I worked for a Cable-Internet company. I know a lot about Modem/Routers.

My phone calls for help are constantly bounced to the Philippines....I cannot understand the reps, they are way overly apologetic for everything, losing sight of the problem I called about. I ask to be transferred to the mainland, and I'm told tech experts are not available.\r\n\r\nAfter a long painful two hours of troubleshooting and attempting to communicate so we both understand, I'm told I need a new modem. They will mail it. 2 days with out service, and in the mail, comes the instruction book for the modem..no modem. I unplug the mess of wiring and pray that I will know how to connect the new modem that I decide to pick up at the Fruitville, Sarasota location.\r\n\r\nAfter driving 12 miles to get there, the office is now located at University, the very northern most boundary of Comcast service territory, with the only other one in the county being located to the south, 30 miles....who was the Comcastic genius who thought this through?\r\n\r\nThe office is in a small plaza, with Millennials staffing it. I'm barely greeted by the greeter, Angel, who asks my first name. The young man is looking at the huge TV screen, not even at me, handing me a piece of paper with my name on it. I am the only customer waiting who is not with someone at the counter. He could at least make eye contact. I ask, \"what is this for? \"...He says I will be called shortly. I am called by a young lady, who also does not make eye contact and expects me to follow her. I tell her I am frustrated. She ignores my statement, and takes my modem, scans it and gives me a new one...that's it?? ?\r\nI am a savvy senior citizen, who looks younger, but has not grown up with technology. It doesn't come easy, however, I understand and know quite a bit. I begin to ask questions about connecting the modem. She is indifferent, with an attitude, quips out short answers, and at the printer tells me, adamantly, all printers are wireless....I know mine is not...it's old, like me, but still works. She is frustrated with me, tells me to call the number, go to the site, on my receipt for instructions. I tell her I don't think I can hook this up. She says, \"Fine, I'll schedule an appointment for $50.\"\r\n\r\nAngel tells me on the way out to have a nice day...I tell him he's the worst receptionist I've ever met.\r\n\r\nI'm really a patient person, I'm not unkind, and I am ashamed that I reacted this way....I have been in customer service for decades, and would never think of treating someone like I was treated.

When I call, they always give me the \"I see you are a loyal customer and here's what I'm gonna do for you\" spiel. This last time, my bill jumped almost $40 a month. When I called, the gentleman said I needed the new equipment so he would send someone out to replace it free of charge. Then, my bill came and it had done up another $28 with the new equipment. \r\n\r\nTelling my story of woe to several people, they all pretty much said the same thing. We could have kept our old equipment so I called to tell them to bring it back. Talking to the operator, she said they could come and get the new equipment but my bill would stay the same as with the new equipment AND, I would be charged $39.99 for the service call. Beyond frustrated as this went on for 3 weeks and the first appt. for a service rep didn't happen.

I wouldn't want anyone to go through that.", "COMCAST/ Xfinity offers the worst customer service. I was paying $34 for the modem and my internet service. I wouldn't complain about the internet service going in and out because yes, it was inexpensive. Almost 12 months with them, I started receiving calls that my bill will go back to the normal price, $79.99, if I didn't change to another promotional price and added TV. I'm not a big fan of watching TV. Ok so I went ahead and picked a bundle for $49.99 a month. My services went off for 7 days when I saw 2 Xfinity men tampering with the Xfinity box outside of my residence. I called customer service, told them I was not going to pay my bill ahead if my services were not up and running. She said, \"I can send a technician to the residence to solve the problem at the cost $50.\" I told her I'd rather cancel than pay someone to fix something 2 Xfinity employees tampered.\r\n\r\nShe informed me that she can waive that fee. I said, \"ok if you're going to waive that fee then I'll pay my bill whenever I get my service restored.\" 4 days later, I arrived home my service were restored. I called the next day to check on my bill and see if the service was waived and if I received a credit into my account for being off 7 days. They informed me that my bill was $33 so I went ahead and paid it. Month after that, my bill shows $141. I called and questioned them and they said that \"The fee wasn't waived, it's $99. We're sorry for who ever misinformed you but you still have to pay the fees.'' \"A sorry doesn't pay the bills,'' I said. \r\n\r\nShe went ahead and said, \"we can credit half.\" I said, \"ok we can do that.\" I asked, \"So how much is my bill now?''. She said, \"$116.\" \"That is not half off the service man, that's just 25% off. They told me it was $99 for the service man,\" and she said, \"That service man was $50. Sorry again for being misinformed. I'm just holding on the line.\" In my mind these people don't know what to say anymore or what to lie about with Xfinity.

Our phone is working just fine. I tested it by using my cell phone with a different area code to call the business number and it works fine. But my customer from Massachusetts was unable to get hold of me. Called Comcast and was put on hold forever. I also got a message that there is an outage in our area that affects our phone service. Comcast phone service and internet is pathetic. Internet is down at least once a week. Some day it will be on and off all day long. Unfortunately I could not switch to another carrier because the other carrier is Verizon and they are just as pathetic. Furthermore there is no Fios in our area from Verizon, a main city in MD, so we have to be stucked with Comcast.", "We paid over $3,000 to have Comcast run internet to our home. Ever since the beginning they have not been able to provide a signal nor have they provided the speed that we have paid for. We have had tech after tech at our home. We had some that said what was wrong only to be contradicted by the next rep. Finally they talked us into going to Business Internet--this too is not working. I have escalated to all levels of management and have had no results. We are now paying over $150.00 per month for internet and this week have dropped over 30 times. Just today 9/1/2016 we lost signal at 9:00 AM, 9:58 AM, 10:46 AM, 12:58 AM and now at 3:45 PM finally no internet came back and I called and they sent a refresh signal.

Overall don't waste your money on this ** horrible internet.", "This should have been a 5 minute process. I should have been able to send a simple email to the Comcast customer service group requesting that my service be turned off at the end of this month. But Comcast does not conduct business via email, so I decided to give their poor chat session a try to see if that would fulfill my needs. Needless to say, it did not. The poor girl was so poorly trained, that I thought that she might have a serious problem with the English language or was possibly dyslexic. Every time I would send a question her way, she would either ignore it, or give me a answer that had nothing to do with my question. \r\n\r\nEventually I gave up and when I attempted to print out the entire conversation so I could actually post it here, I could only get the first page of the conversation to print out. Unbelievable. So you will have to trust me when I say that Comcast is quite possibly the worst cable provider on the face of the earth and please do not use them if you can avoid them. I had to use them as they were the only provider in my apartment community in Lynchburg VA.\r\n\r\nI would also like for everyone to know that even getting into a chat session on a Sunday morning at approximately 11:00 a.m. also took several attempts on my part. The browser states that your chat will begin shortly but after waiting over 10 minutes watching the stupid little lines spin, and spin, and then spin some more, I jumped out and tried to get back in via a different topic. After about 2 more minutes of spinning lines, I finally got the most incompetent representative ever in my 60 years of life on planet earth. Bottom line. If you can avoid Comcast I would highly recommend it. I will not try to point you in a direction towards any other cable provider, but if I can get at least 1 family/person not to sign up with Comcast I feel that this endeavor was worth my time and effort. Can one voice make a difference? YES IT CAN.", "The company is a nightmare to get something solved. Their Customer practice is unethical. For example, they first offer on the phone an XFinity Home (an alarm service for the house) as a free service included in the service. Then, when the workers come to install/fix the service, they bring an agreement of 2 years to sign. After that, it begins a nightmare of constant phone calls, asking you, \"Why do you cancel?\". \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the worker who came to fix/install your system can't go on working. Today, we spent more than 50 minutes, answering the same questions to 3 different Xfinity clerks trying to sell us more stuff. After that, you just want to get rid of them as quickly as possible: the phone clerks insist that they have to talk with the owner (you, looking your clock to rush somewhere) again, and again. Besides, at the point that you were able to have somebody in your house to just fix the speed of your internet service, you have talked to at least 10 persons, you even walked in their store, you still don't have anything solved, and your account climbs again because nothing that you agreed \"is in their system\".", "This is by far the worst company for cable/internet EVER!! I signed up for a 2 year contract and at least 3 times a week had a service interruption. Chats are pointless and calling them is a waste of time. Hours on hold only to get someone (if you're lucky) on the line that doesn't speak english or if you happen to get through you oddly enough get disconnected after waiting an hour on hold. My final straw was when my 4 year old had ordered PPV shows with the push of a button without my knowledge and racked up over $100 in charges on top of my already ridiculous bill I have with them every month. I even have a so-called parental block on the remote.\r\n\r\nThey refuse to credit me because they say he enjoyed the movies for more than 5 minutes. But on my bill it shows he ordered 3 movies within 3 minutes, so how could he be enjoying 3 movies all at the same time on one TV? It should not even be that easy to order a movie with the push of one button. Years ago you would have to confirm 3-4 different ways before a movie was ordered. But I believe they changed this so they could purposely rack up your bill. They should be put out of business and sadly I can't afford a lawyer to sue the pants off them so I am stuck having to pay $513 for this last and FINAL month's bill. All my equipment was dumped off to them today!!", "Our WiFi had stopped working in our apartment, so we made an appointment for someone to come and fix it. It said they'd be here from 3-5 and they ended up showing up at around 630. He said that the apartment needed to be rewired, and that he'd have to get someone else to come and fix it. So he made an appointment for me right there. The soonest available appointment was about a week later on a Thursday from 1-3. My boyfriend took off work to be home that day to let the guy in. However, no one showed up. He looked on the website and the app, and it said no appointment was scheduled. So he called Comcast and they said the guy came and had to come back the next day to finish. This was kind of odd because no one ever came to our apartment. And they never called us to tell us they were coming either like they're supposed to. \r\n\r\nSo Friday, the next day, someone was supposed to come back and finish it. Well no one ever showed up. We called Comcast again, which is really annoying because every time you call them you speak to a new person and have to re-explain your whole situation to them and they're not very helpful. The person on the phone said that someone came on Friday, but no one was home and that they left a thing on the door saying they came. Well that's ** because my boyfriend was here the whole time and no one came. There wasn't anything left on the door either. So they basically lied to us. I doubt anyone actually came on that Thursday either. (They said the work would need to be done outside so we might not see them. But you think they would've still had to come inside and let us know they're there right?) So anyway then they said someone would come on Monday. \r\n\r\nThey finally came on Monday and fixed it. But for about 3 weeks we didn't have internet. We haven't gotten our next bill yet, but they better not charge us for those 3 weeks. It was hard to get in contact with a real person (you have to go through this whole automated phone thing) and then like I said you have to explain your situation over and over again. Why can't they just have the same person or manager talk to you until a situation is resolved? I hate Comcast, but they can do whatever the ** they want and get away with it because there's only like 2 internet providers.", "My complaint is not really with the reps (although maybe). At work we have Comcast for internet and for email. Our internet service was so poor we called them, they confirmed our settings, made changes and then now charge is $20 plus for the change. Trouble is the service is even worse and we pay more for it. To log into email it often takes a good 10 mins. no matter how I attempt it. I absolutely will not allow them in the house. A rep stood on my porch (uninvited) and argued with me about letting them carry my service. Finally I told her to get out and shut the door on her. I, myself, now use Frontier and have no problem at all with my internet service.", "Honestly, we see thousands of complaints, it's a monopoly here in SWFL with no realistic competition. I imagine that as long as they keep the politicians happy ($$) they will get whatever they want. Like many of us, I have major horror stories. Yes they increase prices every year, unless you join for two years. Yes they continuously lie to you with minimal recourse. Yes their customer service is akin to the third world, and they have us.\r\n\r\nI have spent multiple hours for the simplest problems, now all I want is high speed internet, between Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu + a antennae I am perfectly happy. But their ultimate goal is to keep you with multiple shopping channels, infomercials 24 hours per day, and general garbage at expensive monthly rates. All of my dealings with them is via chat, since I can at least document the information, note: you do need to copy and paste the information because unlike most chats you cannot copy your chat.

Each time they claim that I owe a different amount and each time Comcast confirms that nothing is owed. The recent debt collector confirmed that any money paid is forwarded to their offices. They are definitely in contact with Comcast and they use a Comcast internal email: cendiv_collectionagencyescalations@comcast.cable.com. These actions have the appearance of fraudulent efforts to extract money. They waste my time and are very annoying.

Not only do you not get anywhere near (not even half) of the speeds you pay for, it is constantly plagued with drops and DNS issues. Where I live, there are not many alternatives or I would have switched months ago. If you call Comcast they tell you to reboot the modem even if you tell them the history and that you have already tried that numerous times. One would hope in this day and age an ISP would be reliable, reasonably priced and FAST. Comcast done not seem to be any of those - at least in the internet arena.", "Comcast is literally the gold standard for horrific customer service! That is what they are most known for. The term \"Comcast bad\" is an actual term I have heard used in daily conversation regarding poor customer service. Until recently, I had never actually experienced it. The legend certainly lived up to the hype. It started when I was charged an extra $120 for exceeding my internet data usage cap that I didn't even know existed. Had I have known, I would have certainly curbed my usage or altered my service plan. I have been a Comcast customer for years and never had a data cap. Suddenly, my usage is being restricted to 300 gb a month. Anyone who uses Netflix will exceed that in 1 week. This is where the real issues began. I called to speak with a representative to discuss the new internet data cap which took being transferred to 4 different people (each person requiring me to spell out all of my personal info and give a description of my issue). \r\n\r\nThe customer rep I finally spoke to was extremely dismissive of my issue and told me I was informed though my Comcast provided email about the new policy. Ultimately, I requested to add unlimited data for an additional $35 a month to avoid any further charges until I could go through all of my mail to see if I had actually been notified. I wasn't. Then my next bill came and I had a $160 internet cap overage fee. I called Comcast yet again. I began my call at 11:30 am and didn't finish until 7 pm. Throughout that time, I was transferred to dozens of reps (again having to spell out all of my personal info and give a description of my issue to each of them). Every time I was making progress, I would be placed on hold and my call would get disconnected. This happened five times! \r\n\r\nIt is unbelievably frustrating to have to call the basic customer service line and providing every detail about you, your account, and your issue to someone you knew was going to just transfer you to do it all over again with someone else who can't help you. It takes a good 4 or 5 times of getting transferred until you get someone who isn't reading from a script. Throughout that time I did speak with someone who was able to verify that I should have had unlimited service, and also revealed that the Comcast provided email address they sent my notifications to was not even mine. I got 1 of the 2 charges resolved before the fifth time I was disconnected. At that point I literally thought, I would rather pay $120 than have to call Comcast again.", "Comcast is the worst company. They gave us a pink screen. We didn't feel we needed to pay for poor service. Don't ever choose Comcast ever. Too expensive.", "My Comcast cable box last night went into de-programmed mode by itself and would only receive Spanish language, could not change it back to English, tried many times, reverted on its own with no help from Comcast. I had to take the box into the Comcast center today and get a new box and remote. Both had to be reprogrammed with about two hours to make the basics work. Then an hour or more on the phone with tech support. The channels with the X-1 new box do not match the old cable box channels.\r\n\r\nI need a channel guide with the actual channels and what is located on them (for local reception) sent to me in the mail so I can decrypt how things line up in HD. With just getting the box today (X-1), the remote does not operate as did the last one. So we are pressing the remote channel # that are not related to what we were previously watching seeing with the old remote. There is no set of instructions included on how to use the remote other than the basics and not instructions on how to troubleshoot problems. No user guide for the cable box. Just the box and the remote with electric cables.\r\n\r\nThe person in tech support tried to help and provide but was not always clear on what was going on at my end (confused, possible language issue), and did not have a concept of the previous non-functioning box and this new one and the dissociation between the two, also the difference with the new remote which is not user friendly.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that we pay near $240.00 a month for service that is poor with a phone system with delays, breaks in service, God help us if the power goes off, we are dead in the water, and an internet that is not as fast as published. The ping test says something else, that what we are seeing on our end with speed and consistency is not what they show in the test. The TV works but there are delays getting to channels and again it is not user friendly without any instructions, and a lack of a good channel guide that can be easily downloaded with the actual channels that are in our area. We think the service is too expensive for what we get and I cannot understand why the government with all the complaints that have been filed has not done something to get us rebates from Comcast since the cost is way more than I think it should be for what services we receive.", "I have been using Comcast internet for 3 years. It was so far so good. I had this promotion last year and I am calling two months ago to the Comcast hotline asking if they are able to extend it for another year. The agents said yes. But today I checked my account and found that the promotion is GONE. I call the customer service and they could not find any record.

The technician came out and found no problems on our end and said this could happen from heavy traffic. We were billed for this call. We talked to Ryan at Xfinity (upper level technician) and he refused to refund tech support call, claiming his technician \"had not left notes about what was found\". He refused to offer credit for our outages but suggested we pay an additional fee for protection against outages. BBB complaint has been filed.", "I have always hated Comcast, but have used their services for years just because they are the most common service provider. I recently moved and tried to set up Internet through them at my new apartment. The confirmation email I received after ordering the service was completely wrong. They had my wrong address and did not even give me an account number for my new service. I contacted a rep online to get it sorted out. He was so unknowledgeable and unhelpful, I told him I just wanted to cancel the service altogether. He assured me my card would not be charged for the service because he cancelled it. I told him \"ok so when my card IS charged for it anyway, can I get a reference # for this chat for my personal records?\" He blatantly refused to give it to me. I had to ask to speak to a supervisor who finally gave me the code and also 100% assured me my card would not be charged.\r\n\r\nThis morning I checked my bank account and was not at all surprised to find a withdrawal from Comcast. I immediately called and the rep I spoke to wasted almost 2 hours of my time just to tell me she can't find any account charge so she can't do anything about it. I again had to ask for a manager, who instantly said he found the charge and would refund it. I now have to wait 5-7 business days for a refund check for a charge I was repeatedly promised would not be made. The worst customer service in the nation. Will never be a Comcast customer again.

The supervisor told me I didn't complain enough to get all my credit and couldn't go back to last year and see how many I had to get them to come and fix it.

Got another call today after 11am saying that what... They can't make it again. This couldn't possibly mean what the new commercials are saying.\r\n\r\nThey will work around our schedule not the other way around. Well for the 2nd weekend I have rearranged my schedule to accommodate them and they have for the 2nd weekend failed to meet that standard.

Maybe I should take my service and over payment on my account (they owe me money) and find somewhere that values their customers and holds their part of the bargain. Smh.", "In June 2016, I went on a cruise to Alaska. I checked to be sure I would have internet access to check on my husband's severe heart condition and to provide support for my daughter who assumed caregiver responsibilities. I understood that weather and geographic location would affect service. Barring these conditions and in circumstances where 2 other carriers were able to connect swiftly and with stability, I was unable to do so. \r\n\r\nReturning home, I complained to Comcast and was told by Mr ** of their Executive Team that I should not expect good connections when traveling. He volunteered that he often had difficulties with his own service when he traveled to NY! My request for a credit of $175 (paid to Holland America for a satellite connection that worked for the people traveling with me but not for Comcast) was denied. I am angry b/c I was unable to provide the support I anticipated would be needed (it was) and planned to provide. The Comcast Executive Team has been very cavalier with this emotional end-of-life issue. I will be cancelling my service with them this week.", "I read all about Comcast's customer service reps and was prepared for a nightmare. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the sales rep Sally. She helped me set up my new internet deal Lickity Split. People complain about how things weren't part of their agreement or other things of the sort. My advice if you're preparing to wrestle with Comcast reps go in prepared and be firm on your choice but also be polite and you'll find a much more pleasant experience than that which you read about.", "2 - 3 weeks ago I started having problems with my internet. Sometimes it would work perfect and I would get 70MB+ download speed, other times it would drop to ~2MB\u2026 I work from home and I am constantly using Skype to stay in touch with co-workers and clients, you can do this with 2MB d/l. I immediately followed the normal, try to unplug the wireless modem and plug it back in, no change. I called in and used their automated system to reset the modem, no change. I had a modem that was not being rented from Comcast so they were reluctant to send a service tech out to help and pretty much just blamed the problem on the modem. I called the modem provider followed their troubleshooting, no change.. they assured me the problem was with Comcast\u2026\r\n\r\nHere comes the fun part. I decide to get a modem from Comcast so I can get a tech out to resolve the problem. I have three options: 1. Get it shipped for $10, 2. Have it delivered and installed by a tech for $50, 3. Pick it up myself for free. Being the kind of person that likes to save money, I go with option 3. The woman at Comcast I spoke to told me I could go to their Leominster MA location (I live in NH). When I get to the Comcast service center I am told that their modems are for MA residents only\u2026. Great. First Big issues.\r\n\r\nFinally, I get a Comcast modem back to my house, get it all set up and turn on my wi-fi devices. Not only do I experience the same problem, but now it is much, much worse. I reconnect my personal modem and call to have a tech come out to resolve the problem, this was on a Friday. They explained a tech would be out Monday to fix the problem, but the fun part is they could not give me ANY time frame, just \u201csometime Monday\u201d and they will call before they show up.\r\n\r\nMonday comes around it's noon and still no word. I get on Comcast chat support and they assure me someone will be here as scheduled\u2026 4 o\u2019clock comes around, I get on Comcast chat, they assure me someone will be here as scheduled. No one ever showed. Now I\u2019m mad. First thing Tuesday morning I give Comcast a call. They never rescheduled an appointment after the one missed Monday, and they refuse to set me up a same day appointment. The only time he could offer me was Wednesday between 9am-12am (at least it\u2019s not a 24 hour window). He scheduled it and I told him I needed to talk to his manager, he understood and told me I would receive a call from his manager with 1-2 hours. The manager never called.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning I receive a voicemail from Comcast confirming my appointment for between 6pm \u2013 7pm\u2026 What the actual **. 5:25pm comes around and the tech pulls up in front of my house, sits in his van for 35 minutes until 6pm (my two big dogs were not pleased). He comes in my house for about 10-15 minutes plugs his stuff into my modem, checked to make sure the wire wasn\u2019t loose and says it seems normal, and that they will be back the next day (Thursday) to replace the line from the telephone pole to my house. The guy literally did nothing else.\r\n\r\nAll day Thursday no one came\u2026 surprise, surprise. Here we are today on Friday I get in touch with a person from Comcast, nothing was scheduled for anyone to come out to my location and resolve my issue. They tell me that I should expect a call from a tech to schedule another appointment. I won't hold my breath. Comcast has left a permanent bad taste in my mouth. This is literally the worst customer service I have EVER received. It is amazing your company is still in business.", "So I tried to hook my printer up to my network through the provided modem through Comcast. I called in last night to get the USB port on the back to have it enabled, which is what the chat rep told me to do. I spoke to 3 different agents, none of which spoke or even understood English. No matter how much I explained it to them they kept asking me if I was trying to hook my internet up through the USB. So at that point I was pretty pissed.\r\n\r\nThe next day, today, I called in and got an agent who spoke and understood English, thank god. I was told that it would be an \"easy fix\" and they would transfer me to an Advanced Network Tech. I said OK and waited on hold for about 30 minutes. I got to the new tech and explained my issue and first off he laughed at me. Second he told me the USB ports on the back do not even work. Being mad that no one told me this before, I proceed to ask why they sell/rent them that way. He said it isn't something they care enough to fix and then said have fun and hung up on me.\r\n\r\nI have had nothing but problems with Comcast ever since I started using them in 2010. But the only reason I use them is I have to. They strong-arm everyone else that is decent out so they own the area. They outsource to people who do not speak or understand English when there are millions without jobs here in the US who have a firm grasp on the language. They do not care about their customers so much that they lie to them over and over and we have to deal with it because we have no other options because of their corrupt practices of getting others out of the area. This is why people want Google Fiber!", "Experienced intermittent internet issues. Called and spoke to a very friendly and professional customer service person in their internet area. Spent a good amount of time working through possible causes, gave me a few possible paths to fix with where he would start. End up going with having a tech come out. Tech who came out, THE SAME DAY, was also fantastic. He found one problem area with a line and opted to replace all of the cable lines we had. Connection is fantastic now! Tech was friendly and offered tons of advice about cable lines and keeping dogs away from them.", "At least two to three times a week, usually late night or early morning Comcast internet service goes out. The latest time it went out at midnight and stayed out till 4:30 in the morning or later. The other complaint I have is that I pay for a minimum of 80 megabytes a second and Comcast rarely delivers this. AT&T is in the process of putting fiber optic directly to my house and my neighborhood. I am definitely going to take advantage of their service. It will cost less and being that it's fiber optic directly to the house will be much more reliable. It will also allow me to completely get rid of Comcast forever.", "Comcast should feel embarrassed. I very rarely complain about services I purchase, but Comcast has consistently ruined my cable/internet experience on countless occasions for approximately 5 years. If you run speed tests, you will quickly realize you receive a fraction of the speed you paid for, depending on time and day. Speaking with Customer service is dangerous - they withhold information regarding future price/rate changes, so demand crystal clarity when subscribing.\r\n\r\nComcast customer service will inform you there is no complaint dept if you ask. Comcast customer service will speak to you nicely, but screw you bald into the next life. Comcast believes in Price/rate changes for everyone! Some day, A great moral force will demolish the Comcast Empire and demand apologies from its elder prophets. Until then, We the people must cope with the deceitful and incompetent blowhard that is Comcast.", "Since I have been with xfinity comcast have had problem with agents and supervisor giving different instructions every time you call them. Some were rude and not willing to help at all. There are a few who goes above and beyond to help. For instance, I spoke with a male manager, who had informed me that I should have not both the modem arris SB6183 (which cost $100) because they are not compatible with them. However, I specifically bought it because the previous agent informed me it was compatible and to make it worst the box for arris states COMPATIBLE WITH COMCAST. How can someone be a manager and doesn't know his equipments and be a good customer service. Very frustrating. \r\n\r\nThen I called them today to ask for a password for our internet service. The agent gave me their website knowing that it's my personal equipment so when I called again the next agent was unwilling to help and saying that the other agent should have not done that. I spoke with their manager again; this tiny female, and she said I should call the manufacturer for the modem to get the password. Again another manager who doesn't know what she was talking about. First all modem is not wifi can't do password. It needs to be my wifi router. Unless she thought it is router and modem together but she shouldn't have because they saw in their system - that's it's my personal modem with its model number which is modem only. What kind of people are they are hiring.", "I requested the $19.99 internet service. However, I was billed $49.99. After speaking with more than seven customer service representative, I was told they couldn't correct the overbilling. Obviously, I'm VERY DISSATISFIED!!!", "A year ago, Comcast talked me into a 12 month promotion for Internet-only service. I got higher speeds for less money. Great, except now that the 12 month promotion is over, my bill more than TRIPLED. I called to go back to my previous service at my previous price. Comcast now says my previous service is 'no longer offered', and my new 3X-priced service is my lowest cost option. It's not a technical issue - they offer my former service at my former price to new subscribers, but not to existing customers. What Comcast is doing is surcharging existing customers and using that money to subsidize 'teaser' pricing for new customers. Those 'teaser' plans will be yanked after the promo ends, and those customers will end up being surcharged to subsidize teaser rates for the next round of saps.", "I live in Treasure Coast FL and have been trying to get the internet working since August 21, 2016 - now 19 Sept. It has been on and off, on and off, on and off. ONLY in their Corp area do they make customer service a priority.", "I was asking the guy on phone why when I subnet themes router it make Comcast go down. The guy then said \"don't hook the cable from the router to a cable box\". I had said 6 or 8 times cat 5 or cat 6 wire why would that type be hook to a cable box. I ask what he was talking about he said \"rg6 cable jack on modem should not be hook to cable box.\" WOW he wasn't listening to me. I have video game systems I would rather have use cat 6 wire then WiFi but I also have network printer with only rj45 and 1 out of 4 tv has a dead WiFi chip that 2 port and I plan on network hard drive 3 port and number 4 desktop. He said \"Comcast didn't teach them about anything about networking. They learn only about Comcast gear\" that when I hung up my network speed is going to be 150mbps. I don't understand why. If it that high you can't subnet theme home internet. I would buy a router/modem but none has phone line for fax.", "I called Comcast to claim that there was a voice service which I never used on my account. Actually, I called in this May said I only needed Internet service. However, the phone service was still on my account for half a year. Today I called the Box department and the guy called Louigie was very cold and impersonal and only repeated he didn't see any notes from my former notes about cancelling this service. I said it was weird that there had no notes about that because I came into Comcast store to declare that I only need internet. He just kept saying \"I know\" but did not want to help at all. The person from Box department just made me feel Comcast does not care their customers at all. The negligence they made is paid off by customers. This Louigie guy just showed the worst customer experience I have ever had. Thank you for representing Comcast with this image.", "I set up an appointment and it was inconvenient to make sure I was home. After 30 mins past the window I phoned and spoke to a foreign agent who assured me I would get a call back within 30 mins. An hour later after being given a ticket number no one has bothered to call me. My internet service is so terrible and slow and nonexistent.", "This is the company that will come over to your neighbors to install internet service and leave an orange cable across your driveway for weeks (a safety hazard for those children in the neighborhood). Then show up on a Friday afternoon to bury such cables weeks afterwards, cut your house internet line, and ruin your front yard while working. Upon calling about their own technicians disabling your internet, they expect for you to wait four days later without any internet service. To top it off, a service supervisor will then tell you that a dispatch ticket was created for someone to come to your house the following day, but it turns out to be the same ticket number for that appt. four days later. Upon calling to explain the situation they keep you on hold for nearly 40 minutes, then the line cuts off. No one calls you back either. \r\n\r\nI completely lost count of the amount of lies that I have experienced with Comcast in a course of 2 years. This company should not exist and people deserve better. I just don't understand how the US government allows this type of company to grow/expand, yet offer such horrible service and rip people off who don't know any better. I had so much reading to do over the weekend for school and now I have no internet until Tuesday over something Comcast did themselves.", "If I want internet in my complex, it has to be Xfinity. There's an \"Xfinity\" rep for my complex who was trying to charge me $20 more a month than advertised online, wanted my Social Security number, and a $200 dollar deposit. When I told him absolutely not and was going to just order my service online, he then tried to blacklist me from Comcast so that I received a letter saying I had a bad credit score and that Comcast would not provide me with internet services. My credit score is over 740... the guy is just a jerk. Anyway, I had fortunately already bought my services online for a special internet price of $29.99 a month for 25 Mbps. Within one day, my internet was crawling.\r\n\r\nI couldn't stream Netflix on my Apple TV and be on the internet at the same time which is unheard of to millennials like me. SO, I complain to Comcast and after repeating IN TEXT on a chat that I could only have a technician come out on a Saturday, \"Nancy\" schedules it for 10:00 am on a Wednesday. I then have to change the appointment online myself, so I do that to 3pm on a Saturday. To my surprise, I get an email on Tuesday reminding me of my appointment \"tomorrow\" on a Wednesday. I log on and my appointment time has been switched back despite me getting an email confirming Saturday. Also, I log on, it won't let me change my appointment because it says, \"Your technician will arrive today, February 1st.\" IT WAS JANUARY 31ST!!!\r\n\r\nSo, I had another chat with Comcast who finally changed it to the correct time. So here we are on a Saturday and at 2pm I get a call from the technician saying he's outside and I'm not there for my 2 - 4 appointment. WHAT - IT'S 3 -5. I tell him that and he's like, \"Yeah well I'm here so you need to come or I won't be able to do your repair today.\" Fortunately, I was only 15 mins away so came home. He then tells me that I shouldn't be getting 25 mbps for such a low price and that I'm wrong. I show him the receipt and he tells whoever at Comcast he's talking to on the phone that \"the customer claims HE should get 25 mbps.\" Well, first of all, I'm a SHE. Second of all, I had just shown him the confirmation email of speed and price. Absurd.\r\n\r\nAnyway, they finally say they've fixed it and make me plug in my work laptop directly to my modem/router to test the speed which was MUCH better. Well, my Mac/personal computer doesn't have an ethernet port, so when I tell him that the wifi speed is still crawling he says, \"Well Comcast guarantees 25 mbps for wired only, we don't guarantee wifi speed.\" He said it should be a megabyte lower... Well this is 10 megabytes lower. I am literally sitting next to my modem/router. This is the sneakiest thing I've ever heard - who in a private home hooks up to an ethernet port anymore? Mac computers are made the way they are because no one should have to hook up directly! Anyway, I'm furious but at least they didn't raise the price on me...YET....", "Called to cancel business account since no longer have the business since April of 2015. I was told by \"Gary\" that I have to get residential for six months to waive the termination fees. I agreed and got transferred to residential to get a quote on residential. The next time I called to cancel, I was told that I need to set up residential first and call back w/ an account number. So I set up the residential and called customer loyalty back to cancel my business. \r\n\r\nTalked to \"Jeff **\" this time and was told by Jeff, that I was told wrong that the prior representative should have started the process to cancel the business account. This Jeff representative was so rude putting his co-worker under the bus, because now according to him \"he will have to do the cancellation\". I got so frustrated w/ this \"Jeff\" representative attitude and for talking over me, not letting me tell what happened that I decided to just call back and speak w/ another representative and re-tell my story. \r\n\r\nThen the third time I called I talked to another customer loyalty person, this time it's female (forgot to write down her name), and was told that I have to call back from the number they have on file w/ CNBI number. Again, I did what I was told to do thinking that this is Comcast Business procedure. The fourth time I called, talked to \"Codie\" - female rep, she seemed surprised that the other representative had me call back since my email is on file, Codie sent me the document I needed to cancel my account. After four phone calls to Comcast at last one person at least took responsibility and finally helped me. This is a total disappointment and bad customer service experience. If I can score -50% I will with those other two representative that was rude and lacking customer service training.", "The reliability of the service is not very good if you ask me. Always drops wifi all over the house. Rarely get good speed. Wifi is my biggest problem. Gaming is big in my household so the ping is very poor. With the installation, I've had better jobs done by c plus net companies. It was a ok job. Wish cables were hidden better and the modem was more sleek looking.", "The internet provider service can be fast, easy, quick, reliable, trusting, and great price. I am truly amazed on the speed and I have never used anything like it. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. They won't be disappointed. I have already told many friends and family members about it. I will continue to use it and hope others will as well. Installing the service for internet was also simple. Anyone can do it. If you can't, they provide a phone number to contact and walk you through it step by step with no issues. The customer service team is patient and willing to take as much time as needed to fill your problems and needs. They will steer you in the right direction.", "I couldn't be happier with my service through Comcast. My speed with them is just great! I really love how fast it is. No other company has come close. My internet is very reliable. It was very easily installed with no issues. They came and had it all hooked up very quickly and they were very easy to schedule a time with. Everything was very smooth with Comcast. They have always answered very kindly and friendly. I usually always can get a human if needed. Any other companies you have to talk to a machine that never wants to give you a person. When you finally do get to a person there is a very long wait and sometimes you are even disconnected and have to start all over again. Honestly Comcast may cost a little bit more but it is very worth it. I have tried DirecTV and also U-Verse with either super slow internet or even customer service that never answers the phone. I have had nothing but a good relationship with Comcast so far.", "The installation by myself was very simple and easy to understand, however when I called for assistance on wiring they took way too long to get to my house. Longest wait for a company I have ever experienced. The service help was perfect but not worth the wait. I could have found the information online in less time than it took to dial their number. All providers could be faster but I cannot really complain considering when the speed was at its peak it was more than what I expected. Usually we have great connection but many times we suffer from slow speeds and other issues. In recent times it has been slowing down a lot more.", "Most of the time Comcast Internet Service is reliable, there are occasional outages but not too often. It's fast enough to be able to stream movies and music. Downloading large files can be slow, but most of the time it isn't an issue. The fact I can get it installed right away with a lot more fun and addicting and I don't think that it was not immediately available to all of them. Any call to customer service inevitably results in a long time on hold. When trying to solve issues with my connection I'm always told to take steps I have already tried.", "Internet speed can be choppy at times. I have to deal with blackouts sometimes, or slow speed when I am not doing much at all for work, or surfing the web. The speed is not the fastest out there but it at least gives me what I need. I hope they get faster service in the future at a great price so then I can upgrade... or just not charge extra for the speed. It was the fastest and best installation possible. They were here when they said they would be, and they were quick about it along with making sure everything did work, so I did not have to worry about anything not working. The customer service listened to what I had to say and helped me find the best thing I was going to use without push-selling anything else. It was great service.", "I like the reliability it has, it is good overall and it is fast. They work with you. I like the installation process. It don't take that long. They are very nice to chat with and help you. The installers are handy and work fast and accurate when installing what services you are getting installed at the time of installation. I like the customer service they have. The customer service people are helpful and friendly to work with. They help you in whatever you need help with. The speed of the internet is faster than any other company we have had before. I like the speed of the service. With as many objects we have attached to the service for the internet to work is still blazing fast.", "Installation was fast and easy and the people were very nice and knowledgeable. They knew what they were doing and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. When I call they help me immediately without putting me on hold or transferring me and I get to talk to a real person. They also have great prices and I have never had a problem with the internet or billing issues or anything so to me they are just wonderful. I have multiple devices running - about 5 smart phones, one laptop, two smart TVs, and a tablet and the speed is great. Very little buffering. I would recommend to anyone who runs a lot of devices.", "Comcast is very reliable, and always fast and accurate. It's easy to connect to and use. Customer service is excellent as well. It is easy to get a hold of someone and to understand them. They don't leave you on hold for too long or transfer you around. They answer all of my questions and aren't pushy about upgrading. The installation was a fast process. The person installing it was very friendly and knowledgeable. He answered all of my questions and made sure I was content. Comcast is the fastest internet I have ever had. It loads games and apps quickly and installs them fast as well. There is hardly any lagging or bad signal.", "Installation was quick and the wait for a rep to come out was only two days. I was up and running within 2.5 hours. But I'm a little disappointed with the wifi range in the house. Customer Service can usually always solve my problems, however the one problem that I always have is the wait times for a representative to get on the phone. Internet speed is best in class, especially since I live on an island and I'm getting routinely 112 down and 13 up which is plenty for my needs and I work from home a fair amount of the time. Comcast has rarely went down on me. The internet is almost always up and the cable/phone is always up. I have had a great experience with the entire bundle.", "The people who did the wiring messed up & my cable company won't fix it so I am stuck with internet connection that stinks & there is nothing I can do about it. The internet cuts out all time & disconnects when you are in the middle of doing something. It takes too long to reconnect & you lose the spot you was in when it was cut off. When I call the internet customer service number they know what my problem is but continue to not do anything about it. But I can't switch my internet provider to another company.", "The installation was very easy. Downloading from the internet and using the installation team of support personnel make this a particularly simple operation. The customer service personnel are very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting during the installation, the follow up process and in all areas of service. I feel confident that I can get a hold of assistance any time day or night. The internet service is easy to access. Also, the security is a major concern and the service takes many levels of security which include password protection and encryption. I am comfortable with the level of security provided by my server. Lastly, the speed is faster than local servers I have used before. I can power up and get to work when I need to. I have never had an issue getting online with this server and backup servers are also part of the service provided by my carrier.", "You can count on Xfinity to provide high-speed Internet and great cable service. I get 150mbps with my current internet service. It is the highest option available. I have been very satisfied with it thus far. Whenever there is a problem, Xfinity Comcast will fix it immediately. You don't have to put forth much effort to get your problem resolved. Then I have a great experience using their online chat for customer service related issues. Online Chat representatives respond quickly and work hard to get your issues resolved or questions answered. If they are unable to resolve the issue, they will transfer the customer to a higher department. They ensure customer satisfaction. Also, all of the equipment is usually installed correctly and promptly on the initial appointment. The technicians do not have to come out several times because of failure for equipment or service to be properly installed and working.", "They provide Internet that works perfectly where I live. Fast enough that I can run everything that I need to. I can play online games without lagging. It meets all of my expectations and then some! It's even affordable. I would recommend it if you need good internet. Also, customer service reps are friendly and knowledgeable about what they are doing. They know what they are talking about and know how to use words that non-techies can understand easily. The install wasn't painful at all! Compared to past experiences it was easy and neat! Installation was clean and efficient. Would definitely do it again if I move to another house.", "It was good install. They set up a time and schedule a day to fit me better. They did not show up on time but the service was great and I couldn't complain. It was a service I most definitely depended on. I enjoy connecting my Roku to my TV and having Wi-Fi on my cell phone when I am home to avoid the date on my phone bill. The Wi-Fi was great and awesome and I am still a currently a customer. I will not ever be willing to change services in the near future. Also, their customer service was very friendly and helpful with all question and concerns I have had. They always came through to make everything a little more easy for me.", "I love it. It is very reliable internet. I live on back roads which usually internet is slow or not even offered to us. But the service is very fast which was very surprising and I'm so happy with it. And the installation process was pretty quick and the person who worked for the company was very nice and explained everything in a lot of detail. Also, the customer service is pretty good and willing to help with any questions or problems. They're always very nice, respectful, and quick. They were also very helpful when needed, but haven't needed too much from them.", "I'm satisfied with internet speed. The service is mostly consistent and it lets me do everything I need to - videos, games, work, etc. Once in a while it will buffer, but not so much that it annoys us. The installer kept mishearing my husband and set him up with an email address with his name spelled incorrectly. He seemed in a hurry though.", "While on the internet doing some secure banking, I was interrupted by Comcast, to take one of their surveys. I consider this hacking and an invasion of my privacy. Comcast has no right to interfere with my internet connection for any reason without a court order. If Comcast is snooping on its Customers it is an invasion of privacy and against the law. If anyone else has had this happen to them please reply to this email address and include your name to be included in a class action lawsuit against Comcast. **. Thank you.", "So I have had Comcast in the past and my recent experience brought back suppressed memories. The sales representative made a mistake on my install date which I found out on the day of when no one showed up to install my equipment. He never apologized for it. He knew I was busy and was not able to accommodate me when I needed the time rescheduled. I opted for self-install because I was already without Internet and it was unsuccessful. I kept on being transferred to India with no resolution when they attempted to activate the signal. There is no such thing as customer service with Comcast, there is no customer satisfaction. They should be out of business.", "This internet gave me suicidal thoughts. It is almost Call Of Duty Infinite Warfare. Harambe did not die for this >:(", "Every single time I have a service outage I have to call and spend roughly 10 minutes -15 minutes on the phone to get a service credit. They give out credits based on the time the internet was down so it ends up being only like a dollar. The problem is they KNOW my address is under a service outage but they put zero effort into identifying customers effected by the outage and they DO NOT apply credits automatically, rather they WAIT UNTIL A CUSTOMER CALLS, to apply the credit.\r\n\r\nThe catch 22 is that IS A 15 MINUTE PHONE CALL TALKING TO A WALL WORTH A DOLLAR? They basically steal people's credits by making them waste time calling in so that ultimately it won't be worth it. TERRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICE. Customer service reps, while repetitive, honestly try their best with irate customers such as myself, and their job is highly under appreciated as well as they're not given the tools to solve issues on the front line. Comcast is a semi monopolistic cable provider and their service shows it. Their TRASH company will ultimately fail if other providers break into the market.", "Xfinity (Comcast)... has a very obvious political agenda. I use Xfinity as my home page. That is about to end. Also am rethinking using Comcast altogether. The Xfinity home page is ALWAYS anti-Trump, anti-Republican party. All of the news for selection is very bias, so it is not \"news\" it is opinion. I am very disappointed. Is there anywhere I can go for fair reporting?", "Well, I moved to Chattanooga from Atlanta for a new career venture. I haven't purchased cable for at least 4 yrs now because I stream everything and I firmly believe cable tv is a waste of money that will soon be obsolete. Back to topic, I opted for Xfinity/Comcast over Chattanoogas EPB mostly because it was familiar and cheaper. I got a pretty decent deal coming from a previously handsome employee management discount with ATT. Although UVerse was even worse than Xfinity/Comcast, I put up with it because it was so cheap. So, Comcast. Good deal. Great internet speed. No contract.\r\n\r\nThe first issue arose after a month and a half in. I kept getting a notification that I was about to reach my data limit and would be charged $10 per gig if I went over. I was never informed of data caps when I purchased. If so, I would have opted for EPB because they have none and I stream a lot. I can't have a data cap of 600gigs a month. So I called to complain and cancel. I had already contacted EPB and set up an install date. I'm not sure why but I called Comcast again to inquire more about the data cap and to tell them that I wasn't paying for overages. I was then informed that Comcast had decided to raise the data caps to 1050gigs. I was assured that I would never reach it so I decided to stay with Comcast.\r\n\r\nNow that that was resolved it was back to my regular schedule until I noticed that my internet speeds were gradually getting slower. Then over the past 3 weeks, the internet connection started dropping. I called and was told it was my router. That it was damaged and needed to be exchanged for a new one. I never got around to getting a new router but it kept dropping at the same time every day between 7 pm & 9 pm. So I contacted them again and the Rep fixed the issue and told me that the problem wasn't my router but the way it was wired.\r\n\r\nSo after rewiring it was working fine but now it's not only getting slower every day but the connection drops frequently. Still between certain hours but always after 6 pm. It's so bad now that it's dropping the connection at least every 30 to 45 mins. That's just this evening and even now at 12:55 am EST. I have two choices... Wait between 7-10 mins for the router to reboot and reconnect on its own once the connection returns or I manually unplug and force a reboot which takes a while as well and still does not guarantee a connect even after all the lights are solid and flashing.\r\n\r\nNow I have the Xfinity My Account app which NEVER says there is a reported outage but instead just informs me that my router is not connected to the internet. I can also restart via the app but it's useless too. I've finally had enough. I'm leaving Comcast behind. It's become a complete hassle. I'm paying for services that I can only enjoy up until 6 pm daily. I'm at my wits end. Comcast is officially the worst internet service in the nation. I mean Uverse is extremely slow but I could at least depend on that slow connection. It rarely went down... Even in storms but with Comcast I can't even keep a connection. If you have Comcast do yourself a favor and rid yourself of it.", "We have been with Comcast for less than 6 months. 1st of all when setting up our cable & Internet & security system they sent an unprofessional individual who spent over 10 hours setting these services up in our home - very uncomfortable and so glad we had no plans to leave our home that day. Second of all we have had poor connection with the Internet since day 1. We called for a technician to come out and it took 1 week to send someone out... This is not our main complaint. Our main complaint is that the \"technician\" they sent out was another unprofessional employee who ended up running exposed wires from the middle of our cul de sac through our neighbors yard and our yard in order for us to have \"working Internet\". \r\n\r\nWe were a little taken aback by this form of set up and asked when these exposed wires would be buried. The unprofessional \"technician\" then informed us he would submit for another technician to come out & bury the wires. After 2 business days we had not heard from any \"follow up technician\" and so on the 3rd business day after our Internet was \"fixed\" we called in to find out what was going on with burying the exposed wires. We spoke to a Wanda and were told that no one had submitted a \"fix it ticket\"! After explaining to her everything we had gone through, she then said that a technician would be calling us to come out soon. \r\n\r\nAfter waiting 2 more days from talking to Wanda we decided to call back and find out when this \"technician\" was scheduled to come out. We ended up speaking with a Mrs. ** who also told us that we still had no \"fix it ticket\" in the system!! She then heard the WHOLE story and told me that she would call me later that day (yesterday) and let me know who would be coming out but that I should have been told it would take 14 days to fix. I was like - \"14 additional days... Cause it's already been 1 full week since these wires have been exposed\"... \r\n\r\nSo I never heard from Mrs. ** as she promised and I called in today and spoke with someone who told me they live in the Philippines and explained EVERYTHING yet AGAIN and long story short... My husband is on the phone STILL trying to get this resolved before September 12th as we were told today is when they are sending a \"technician\" out to bury our exposed wires. I am writing this because unfortunately Comcast is NOT WORTH USING! They have not apologized or resolved our issues!! We will be getting Apple TV & or Netflix after this! Please be warned... This is an unprofessional company that does not deserve our hard earned money or time!", "I used Comcast for approximately 4 years prior to ATT Uverse. Each customer service rep I had to speak with although seemed ethical, never was. I called to check their promos and was given what I thought was a great price for all three services, and for about 3 months my bill stated exactly what I was quoted. On the 4th month and every month thereafter the bill increased. I was never advised by my Comcast rep that there would be an increase in one year, but why would he if the plan for good for one year? Every month after that I had problems with my bill, always increasing.\r\n\r\nI finally had enough and after calling Comcast Customer Service and being transferred to three (3) different rep's I finally got a supervisor who after 2 hours on the phone with him had the audacity to tell me that the Comcast rep I originally had when I signed up with Comcast, didn't have the authority to offer me the original promotional price he offered. Well if the customer rep that answers the phone gives me a price should I ask for his credentials or his actual job description? Finally, I contacted ATT Uverse, who initially gave me a promotional price which has finally expired, but even then, UVerse didn't lie to me and kept track of any conversations or offers they gave me. I finally cancelled my service with Comcast and have been with UVerse ever since. I wouldn't go back to Comcast if my life depended on it. They are the worse, lying company I've ever done business with.", "CrapCast is going to forever ** the consumers for 10x the value of what their services are actually worth. ConCast has even decided to split up its bandwidth forcing its customers to upgrade their old boxes to accommodate XFINITY's new spy software. As for their internet services $50 gets you some rocking speeds, but a $20 they put a governor on that speed.", "I was basically forced to purchase a tv/internet bundle last yr in order to get the 150mps service for internet. I paid $61.99 mth and NEVER used the tv service. Never opened the box. So without notice they charged me $100 and then offered me new service for internet, but only if I agreed to a contract with early cancellation penalties. They basically hold your service hostage if you don't agree. They are the only provider in my area with the mps I require. Poor customer\r\nservice, tech calls never followed thru with. In short, they suck. I also can only use my devices within 15 direct feet of my wireless modem.", "I am on social security disability and am pretty much confined to my apartment. I got Comcast internet with 10MB for $14.99 a month for two years. Everything was ok until the next month when I got a letter in the mail addressed to me, not a bulk mailing. It offered 50+ channels for $19.99 a month for two years. It had all the channels I wanted. I decided to order it. When I called the representative, couldn't find that offer. After about a half hour she found one that had 35 channels for the same price. It had all the channels I was interested in so I ordered it. After they came and hooked it up I went to use it & could only get ten channels! Less than I was getting with my rabbit ears.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the runaround from 3 phone calls I was told they couldn't add the 35 channels to my internet, they had to put me in a bundle. This was never explained to me. This bundle was going to cost me $44.95 instead of $34.98!!! If I wanted to get the 35 channels it was going to cost me around $70.00 a month. Also the never told me I could get away without renting the box with the fancy voice activated remote. Since they had a \"30 day guarantee\" I told them I couldn't afford that price so just come and get the equipment & just give me back my 2 year $14.99 internet back. Well I was told the $14.99 internet was no longer available, only a $19.99 for one year. Asked to speak to a manager & was told there's nothing they could do it was no longer in the computer.\r\n\r\nI was the manager of a business that sold radio station equipment for ten years. We could manually change the price, description and terms on any item. There is no reason they couldn't go back & restore what I had. Especially since this whole problem was 110% their fault. I got nowhere with them, was so disgusted with the runaround, bait and switch tactics & totally unaware of what they were doing I just canceled the internet too. Comcast is the only show in town except for AT&T. I would never use AT&T because of a problem I had with them. I got a cell phone & internet plan from them. It had a two year contract but the price was right. I had windows 95 at the time. They sent me a windows 98 CD, which definitely wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nThey sent me a total of 7 Windows 98 CD's. Since I couldn't get the internet, I told them I was cancelling it. Well they tried to get me to pay for the whole two year contract. They put that into collections which at last count had been resold. I believe it's like the tenth or eleventh company that has bought the \"debt\". The last one that called said that now with interest & all the fees was around $5000. When I explained about the Windows 95/98 disc problem she was so young she had no idea what Windows 95/98 was!!! L.O.L.\r\n\r\nSo I bought an extender & give my landlord $10.00 to use his. Sometimes when he is playing games loading is real slow & I can't go and sit outside and use it. My only option is to get Metro PCS and use the phone as a hotspot but at $50.00 a month I just can't afford it. As it is I am struggling to get by on $1200.00 a month disability, with $700.00 rent & $120.00 electric plus food it doesn't leave too many discretionary $'s for Comcast's exorbitant $'s. How many people do you know living on less than $400.00 a month???\r\n\r\nSo I am stuck with over the air TV & subpar internet to try and fight off cabin fever. Actually I don't know anyone who raves about either one of these monopolies. Comcast has made enough money with these shenanigans to buy NBC & Universal Studios and parks!!! And they treat customers like this. Same goes for AT&T.", "The internet is very SLOW. Although they promise 75 Mbps, I actually got 10 Mbps on average. The bill is ridiculous. When I install their internet, they promise a monthly fee of $59.99 for one year. But in the second month, I got $69.99 on my bill, only because I didn't sign up for paperless bill. But nobody informs me of this before.", "The company itself was great. The install tech arrived promptly calling an hour before to confirm the appointment. He installed quickly, and gave both my husband and I a quick training course on operation of devices. He also explained the warranty process and gave us troubleshooting tips for future use. I never had an issue with customer service or billing. The few times I had to call customer service I was always met with nice reps. My questions and concerns were always addressed quickly and all issues were addressed in a timely manner. The techs were great and respectful every time they had to come out. I would definitely recommend them. The internet speed was awesome for the area I live in. I am from a very rural area and we barely get cell service. So imagine our surprise when we only had one bad outage in 5 years.", "Comcast has fast and easy do it yourself installation. All you need to do is get your equipment and take it home and install it yourself. No waiting on a person to come to your house. They have different speed packages for all your needs and low prices to fit all kinds of budgets. They also have great customer service. They are very helpful if you need to change plans or have a question about your bill. They are also there 24 hours a day to help at time that works for you. Comcast internet service has fast speeds that you can use to play games or watch a movie with. The spores can be slow at time if you have lots of people trying to use the internet at the same time for different things such as online gaming and just checking email on your phone.", "When we upgraded to the X1 platform, it took the installer over 2 hours (timing also interfered with my young toddlers nap time). The timing wouldn't have bothered me had everything worked! Our 2nd cable box did not work less than a day after installation. 2nd guy who came to fix it was also at my house for an extended period of time and he was very sloppy! We have exposed wires/cables that we have been having to be creative in hiding from our toddler. Furthermore, I normally leave calling customer service to my husband but I have noticed they are inconsistent. Some are great and very helpful but for every great experience, we have had a matching awful experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, internet is generally fast and without outages. Occasionally we have issues with slowness on our tablet and that's frustrating. For the most part, we have speedy connections and no issues. We usually can get what we need from the internet pretty quickly. Connections on laptops, phones and tablets have been pretty successful. Family coming over have been able to successfully connect their devices to the wifi as well.", "Installation wasn't too hard. You follow the books to hook up your boxes. If you need help, all you have to do is call and they will walk you through it. Customer service is great and they are in 24 hrs. I can always rely on them. If I am having issues, they are gladly to help and they always try to resolve your issue for you. The speed is pretty fast as well. Only time it goes slow is when they are working on the lines near my house or if there is a bad storm. It's the fastest provider and I would definitely recommend them to a friend.", "A gentleman came to our home at a time that worked for me. He was in and out in a timely manner as well as he was quite about the whole process as my small child was asleep and he did not want to wake her. I never have issues with reliability as far as the internet service but the customer service is not very reliable though. They have horrible customer service with the few people I have dealt with. Including a late payment where a person came to my house at 9pm on a Sunday to try to collect the payment. When I refused to open my door he continued to call me, he has no form of identification. The main reason I stay with Comcast is because I am able to use so many devices at once without anyone suffering from slowness. The speed of internet is very fast.", "We are very happy with the speed of our internet service provider. No matter what we are watching on-line there is very little loading wait times if any at all. We couldn't be happier with the speed. Comcast is very good. It's out of sight out of mind because our internet is always performing in tip top shape. We are also very happy with the installation. It was fast and easy for them to set up. They arrived promptly at the designated time. We've only called customer service once and they were polite and efficient and assured us the problem would be fixed as soon as possible. In all the years we've had the service, we have not had any other troubles so I'm very pleased as I hate calling customer service in general.", "We have had Comcast for quite sometime but I remember the installation being fairly easy. We may have had a slight wait but once they came it was quick and efficient. The customer service has been pretty good. The only problem is that sometimes if you are having a problem it may take several days before they can come to your house. Also, I am a little disappointed in the speed. When I first started I was completely satisfied but lately I haven't been as much. I don't feel the coverage or the connection is as good as it should be. Sometimes I can't even connect in my house. I feel like I am paying for high speed internet and sometimes it does take a little longer to connect than it should.", "The installation was quite odd because we were supposed to have someone come down and do it for us but my brother-in-law ended up doing it because it took so long to get a hold of the people. But the customer service has amazing reviews according to others and I'd have to agree. They are fast and accommodating. They walk you through everything and help you quickly. \r\n\r\nThe reliability is wonderful. I remember before switching my Internet was complete poo and would only work a bit of the time. Now it works 100% of the time and is faster than lightning. The speed is amazing. My old Internet took hours to download just one little game. Now it's done in minutes. It's great! I never have to worry about resetting the router.", "The installation was quick and easy, and took very little effort at all. I had no problems at all in setting it up, and it should be easy enough for just about anyone to do. If there were any problems, customer service was quick to help, and did the best that they could to solve the issue. All in all, the service was pretty good. The service was reliable at most times, though it could be a little spotty during less than perfect weather conditions.", "The installation was very quick and easy for the Comcast installation guy. He was a very nice man and he seemed to know what he was doing that day. Comcast's customer service guy was very nice and easy to deal with. He answered every question in a quick and easy response. They are very reliable and the internet is very fast and easy to use. It is a lot quicker than the one that we had before. I would really recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good and reliable cable company for internet.", "Comcast is a very reliable internet provider. They provide great service. I would definitely recommend it. The installation was great. There were no problems with it nor with the customer service. I've been very satisfied with my service.", "Didn't think installation would take more than one guy to set it up but they were very thorough and walked me through operation step by step and were super helpful. Comcast was super fast most of the time but there would be erratic patches where it would go out for a couple hours at a time. Customer service always credited my account for down time though. It always ended positive but as with most customer service phone calls you can expect to be on the phone forever and not talk to someone helpful the first time someone picks up. By the second person it usually gets to be helpful. The service speed is excellent most of the time except during high traffic times like weekends and prime time you can tell it slows a bit. It's usually pretty reliable and doesn't go down for long.", "Everyone at customer service that I needed to speak with about questions regarding my account was always super nice and gave me the info I needed. They were very informative on any deals or specials. They were always available on phone, which was excellent for me. They were able to get my needed appts. promptly, but, eta was too general in nature... Ex. \"Service person will arrive anytime between 8 am and 4 pm.\" That didn't always happen either. I was happy with the customer service until I wanted to cancel because they turned into asses! Installation provided was excellent and done in timely manner. I was informed of directions on how to work, and all needed service numbers, etc. Service lost frequently due to stormy weather. But I was satisfied with the speed. It was fine for what I needed it for. Had I been a more avid user, I'm not sure if it would have been fast enough then!", "I have to update the modem every now and then and lose wifi often. But I live in the country so it's common. I'd be happy if they didn't cut my area's wifi off to fix one person's problems. I installed my wifi modem by myself. I went to Best Buy and bought the best modem and then set the connection up myself after the service provider said I should update my modem. Their customer service is online so there is little phone conversation. I personally enjoy it, but it can get tough when there isn't anything to help with my problems. Especially regarding my cable box. I wish internet speed was faster and handled more than one person on it, but it's a decent speed. Seriously, what kind of dumb wifi doesn't let more than one person on at once, this isn't the 1990's.", "The installation is a little meh. It really could have been better. The cords were a little wonky that I had to fix it myself. Not a total good thing. Besides the obviously subpar installation, the customer service was pretty good. They are lucky that they hired such good people for their customer service. Also, I would pretty much say that I am happy with the reliability of my internet service. I specifically say this because it rarely lags and it not drop my info. Though the reliability is good, but the speed is satisfactory. It really could have been faster and much more than what is given. Maybe increasing the speed by more that 30 Mbps? That should be good.", "Installation was easy but we were already equipped for it in our house previously which made it a lot easier. The tech that came out was nice but my customer service experience was the absolute worst. They charged us more than they said that they would. They change the price on us twice and also charged us even when the service wasn't working. They owed us money and instead billed as I still have outstanding bills with them because I refused to pay when they owed us money. Internet would go down often. It seemed to start off good but it got worse as time gone high and did not meet our needs. They said that it would be faster than it was and when it didn't work they tried to blame it on our computers or equipment which had nothing to do with the internet. I'm calling customer service but he would never give straight answers. I wouldn't recommend them.", "When the installation guy came to install he claimed that he couldn't connect the cable to the upstairs TV. There was no reason other than him being lazy that this was not able to be connected. Comcast has good service, though, but they keep raising the prices. I have had trouble with the Internet not working or working slowly at times for no reason. Sometimes the Internet will work on some devices and not others, but we have been pretty happy with the speed of the Internet in our house for most of the devices that get the Internet. We have been pretty satisfied in the past with customer service. There were times though when we did have to wait a long time to get an actual person to talk to.", "My internet started out fast, but the past few months I have been having issues. The internet would either be really slow or it would not connect at all. The customer service is always very helpful and kind. They are very reliable when calling and assisting with any issues. They are knowledgeable about any update, issues, and ways they can help. I also appreciate when they add some extra movie perks. It's just frustrating when you have to keep calling customer service and there is an automated recording. The technician was very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. They were also very timely and helpful with installing the systems! Highly recommend Comcast for their technicians and technical support.", "Pretty fast. Rarely drops. I'd say 28 days out of the month the service is fast and reliable. If it does drop, its usually later at night. I don't fault the provider. I'm sure they're trying as hard as they can. Though for what we pay I should be able to have a page downloaded in less than 5 seconds. Installation by the employee was very quick and smooth. The man who installed ours was very nice and even took off his boots so as not to track in mud. If we have a problem the customer service is easy to talk to if you can get a native English speaker. It's hard to try and understand the very thick accents.", "It took two weeks to do the installation but it was worth the wait, time and money. They are fast and make sure you are satisfied by the time that they leave. Customer service was wonderful, respectful and was on top of your problem or issue. I would recommend Comcast to anyone who would want fast and reliable cable and internet.", "I've had Comcast for a few months and my internet service is very reliable and the speed is excellent. I can watch my shows without them ever stopping to buffer. I like binge watching shows every so often and I've never had any loading issues or complaints about my internet speed. It was a painless and easy installation. The person that installed the cable seemed very competent and knew what he was doing. He was in and out and came when he was supposed to be here. I have had no problems with billing, too. Everyone seems like they know what they are doing and very knowledgeable.", "It's a very easy installation process. They send someone out who helps you get everything just right and walk you through the whole process while explaining it to you. The service is very reliable and always works. The speed is good and works great for browsing the internet and watching YouTube videos. The customer service is decent too. They have normal business hours, which could definitely be expanded. Overall it's what to be expected from a major company.", "Comcast got here in good time and when connecting it, helped me to understand what they were doing and also showed me how to fix wires if need to! They were very thoughtful, very tech savvy and polite! Plus, I enjoyed the way the customer service communicated with me and the respect they gave to me and asked me if I had any questions for them! They stay and made sure everything was working and that I was very satisfied! I like how fast the internet is and how helpful they can be if a problem arises because they always have their customers to make sure they are happy with their services! I would tell friends and family to get it!", "Very easy to set up. All you have to do is follow the instructions and you're good to go. The instructions are detailed and very easy to understand. In my type of job, fast internet is what I need and Verizon delivers! In my area, there are none to less downtime and the internet is really fast. I can stream online without any interruptions and do video calling in HD which is awesome. Customer service is everything and based on my experience they are friendly and willing to help. I'm happy with the customer service I got. I'd recommend this to my friends!", "Comcast Internet Service was for the most part very reliable. I have few to no complaints regarding reliability. Even during storms when an outage was to be expected it came through and pretty quick and clearly at that. The installation process was quick, easy and efficient. They were friendly and helpful. They explained thoroughly and came on time not leaving me to waste a day waiting and wondering when they would be over. Customer service was definitely worth five or even six stars easily. They are very friendly, knowledgeable, respectful, courteous and downright good helpful people who know their job. I am very happy with the speed of the internet. It is absolutely perfect for my and my family's needs. It doesn't freeze up and we can get our information and keep on going with our day.", "Installation was fast and easy. The tech was on time and didn't leave a mess. He set up and connected all my devices for me. I live in an unpopulated area and my service is great. Speed is fabulous and it's just as fast as it would be in the city so I have no complaints. Always works even when my phone doesn't. Never get booted off, works fast but I only use it for about 5 devices. Very affordable. From what I have used with customer service, I'm satisfied.", "The installation was fast, easy and I also had a good window of time for installation. I didn't have to take a full day off work, only a couple of hours, to be home waiting for the cable guy to show up. In addition, the internet speed was fast with the ability to upgrade at any time. I had no issues with internet speed with the plan I selected. I'm satisfied with the speed and connection. Also, I was able to access customer service any time of the day, although it took a lot of steps to get a representative on the phone or to the right department for assistance. Every time I spoke with customer service my issue was resolved and I didn't have to wait too long for assistance.", "I have had my services with them for a long time now. The installation guy was friendly and on time. Also it was very fast and put together and was well organized in my house. They are really good. Always helpful and very fast reliable service. The customer service has always been great in my opinion. Every time I call they do not hesitate to help me. They are very, very nice about everything as well. The speed is great although sometimes it lags but we wonder if it's because we have so many devices going at one time. We have considered switching to a better plan.", "Comcast provides a reliable broadband internet service that offers great customer service. Any time of day or night it is available with little to no outages. The install was fast and efficient. No problems with the customer service provided for the installation of the internet. They were friendly and knowledgeable. Any time I have to contact them they are also friendly and knowledgeable. Also, their online support is fast and very efficient. I have used it several times to check if it was my service or my wifi router. Most times it has been as simple as turning off my router and restarting. The online support walks me through the process and tests my service. Most days I have little problems with the speed. But I am able to stream movies with no issues. Occasionally I have slower service in the evenings but that is a rarity.", "I don't really have a problem with our internet service ever. Our wifi could be a little better, but I think it's because so many use it at once. They have very easy installation. I did it myself and I am not very handy with electronics. It was simple, fast, easy and step by step directions! Every time we go to pay our bill the sweetest woman is at the counter. I usually wait to see her especially. We have never had an issue with speed on our desktop computer, just wifi every once in a while.", "Comcast works but crashes sometimes or logs out, lots of service interrupts where there is no tv or internet and we have to reconnect everything to the web. Usually don't have a problem with internet speed except a few occasions were it would stop, load so slow that I would get an error message and have to restart my computer or refresh the page. But Installation was pretty straightforward and the tech guy came out and had it set up quickly and even explained how to use the equipment and who to call if we have a question. They answer the phone pretty quickly and at first seem knowledgeable, but then you spend an hour on the phone fixing your problems, in my last case, an extra charge on my bill, only to find out later that it wasn't fixed at all.", "The installation process was quick and easy. The installer was very professional and got it done fast. Comcast is very reliable. The speed is awesome even when storms and wind hits. Most services blow out once there's a storm. But this one is always on. Also, the speeds are great even when the highest level of usage among users occurs. If I need any help, I just contact the customer service reps and they fix it fast. The customer service department is great. Not just the telephone reps but all the employees. The professionalism of this company is outstanding. I have never received such a great level of customer service with any other provider. I would recommend this service to anyone because of the awesome services received.", "It took a minute for the men to get here, but the once they did, the installation was quick. It probably only took about less than ten minutes which is my kind of service. The internet service works when there isn't a storm. It is a really good service connection when the sun is out but on any other day, it's not as good. However, their customer service is not the best and not the fastest. But every work place has its rude person. But when I called everything was just fine although could've been better. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind recommending.", "Internet installation was part of a bundle service and the first technicians that came out were not honest in options that needed to be completed. I was so unhappy I tried to change service but in my neighborhood there was not really another option. This was a couple of years ago and I know I had several more examples where I was completely dissatisfied but since the install was completed, the correct equipment provided I've not had an issue and my last technician was open honest and shared his work contact if I had further issues. He saved the service. Also, customer service is best when you don't need them. My gut instinct is to find a solution without reaching out to customer service via phone because of some really negative experiences. When I have gone to my account online though, their chat reps are quick to connect to see how they can help. So for this reason I have rated satisfied.\r\n\r\nFor what we use the Internet for I am happy with the speed. We stream TV shows, have many devices connected and have no issues. We are not downloading a ton of content nor gaming which I think helps the speed level. Visiting websites does not seem to be slowed and I am able to connect remotely to work. Also, very rarely have we had issues with Internet. Power outages may impact it but once restored little effort needed to get back online. Billing is easy with auto pay and there has been little need to reach out to customer service.", "I ordered it and it worked out quick and responsive. I didn't have to be on hold too long. The guy who installed it knew exactly what he was doing and he was in and out in under an hour. I was pleased with how long it took him. The speed is as fast as I'll ever need. I have 60 mbps and it works great. I don't ever have any issues with it going out and I can watch videos or do whatever I need to do. Also, I can have all of my devices connected at once and do anything on them.", "I like Comcast. The installation was sweet. It was quick and done great with no problems. He even explained everything to me that he was doing. He came at the right time that he said he was coming. Customer care was good. All the problems I had was fixed. They were very helpful even after I told them I wanted to end my services with them they still tried to get me to stay. But they barely spoke English. I also love the fast speed and I enjoyed it. It's always on point and never a problem. It's wonderful, great, and they really do deliver on speed. I wish I still had it but I wouldn't go back until they do something about their price. In fact, I wanted to stay but that $500 a month was killing me.", "I was really pleased with the installation. The employees were on time and very nice as well as setting up at a fast pace. The price for installation was reasonable. The service is fast and reliable and has quality customer service. Rates are reasonable and has easy payment options too. The speed of internet service I get is very acceptable. It could be faster but we pay for what we get and I am happy with the overall speed provided. I have never had a bad customer service issue. All my problems are solved immediately and all my questions were answered in a knowledgeable way that I understood.", "I set everything up myself and it worked properly. I was sent my needed tools through the mail with easy to use instructions. I did then call to set up a new tablet and get my email working through their service. I was guided step by step. It was very easy. Comcast customer service is excellent. I do not wait on hold and the representatives are knowledgeable and helpful whether it is a technical issue or a speed issue. If we can not resolve a service person will be set up to come to my home and take care of the problem. My internet gets slow but they always do what it takes to fix the issue. Always adding new upgrades to make my internet faster and better. I recently upgraded to the highest speed available. My computer is running slower. I haven't had a chance to contact Comcast but I am sure they will take care of it.", "Comcast Internet tends to go down often at random times. However calling the company for help is always a good fix. They answer calls every time and try to help as much as possible. Last time I called, the employee took me step by step on what to do to fix my issue. The installation was fine. It was quick and easy. The representative was not so approachable though. He looked like he hated his job. I feel like he could have done a little more to make the experience a little less awkward. But despite that, representative did what he needed to do without any major complaints or issues. So, the experience was fine and I was happy with the speed of the installation.", "The installer was knowledgeable and so was able to complete the tasks timely. He also took the time to explain what he was doing, asked if I had questions, and checked the wiring I already had to make sure there were no issues before he left. Great channel selection and very little downtime. My internet speed is fast enough to support multiple devices in use at the same time and has seldom been an issue. The equipment is reliable, and the service is seldom affected by the weather. Occasionally, buffering takes longer than usual but I would estimate that it is only 1-2% of time. However, customer service, whether through the website or by phone, can be time-consuming and sometimes not particularly user-friendly. However, all employees have been courteous and patient.", "The installation process was good. I installed everything on my own and it was very easy. Any questions or problems I had I called customer service and they was very helpful and answer all questions. They are very informative and give useful information and they made sure I had everything I needed. Customer service is great as well as the internet reliability. There are minimal to no interruption and if so it's taken care of in a mannerly fashion. It's high speed and it only takes a few seconds for web pages to load. It doesn't slow down when multiple people and devices are on at the same time. The speed is great.", "Disappointed. I have been a Comcast/Xfinity customer for almost two decades. I pay for high speeds and get intermittent internet. I call every week almost-- can't take the time to call more often and get FRUSTRATED. I spend 30 minutes with the first person resetting the modem (walking through their initial process - even after giving them the history) only to be told I will have to pay for a technician. After some complaining and explaining - they transfer me to a specialist who does speed tests and confirms what I am saying even though their test \"say\" the modem is working - he test each port on the modem (which is a new modem they replaced last week) and I have the same issue - tells me there is a line issue and my modem isn't performing correctly - technician reprograms the ports--retests it works awesome initially when they get it to carry more data--only to retest with the technician a few minutes later and the speed is low again. \r\n\r\nThey say they need to send out a tech to look at the lines - COLD transfer me back to Xfinity without warning and when someone answers they start the process ALL OVER AGAIN - reset the modem charge me for tech - transfer me to specialist - another 3 hours wasted this week, last week - in this modern age and for $216 a month you would think you could work from home without distractions. I pay for the fastest package 115 mbps download and 25 mbps upload and receive random speeds throughout the day (between 9-80 mbps download and 2-22 mbps) upload - most often in the lower numbers with wireless monitoring showing \"dropped\" messages from my server and having to refresh pages and lose data regularly. Is there anyone out there who can help? I am attaching several speed tests from today during my calls between 10-12 a.m cst. What does a consumer do? Is there a dependable internet provider? It feels like they use their call systems to bully/frustrate the customer into submission.", "I have had cable, DISH, and U-verse, etc. in the past. All are eh... but you know what? Comcast takes the cake. I have never been driven to take time out of my day just to gripe online for all to see. But consumers, stay away! So my first terrible experience with Comcast is that they took 5 phones and 2 months to come out and bury the lines they had to lay in my front yard to get the cable needed into my house. Finally got someone when my special needs neighbor tripped and fell!\r\n\r\nNow 3 months into my contract, I have had my internet, phone, and TV go out for HOURS at a time. I would spend 3 hours on with a tech when it will come back up after the technician resets the router manually for the 3rd or 4th time. I have had it, I work from home occasionally and this is a huge inconvenience! The hardware is faulty, I understand that sometimes you get a lemon... but 3 months! 3 months! I have had it. Worst company ever. Crappy equipment and terrible customer service, and worse is the technicians they hire! Not a clue! Comcast should send a technician out here to switch out this equipment before I set a bonfire to it.", "*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nReview already published in https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kzuv4nezBB5goo6FOdvEOQ\r\n*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n16 days- 11calls - 160 min on the phone - 3 no show appointments\r\nAccount # 8777703173954770\r\nI contacted Comcast/Xfinity on Sept. 6th to advise my internet service was not working. It is now the evening of 09/21/2016 and I still have no service. Today I experienced complete humiliation waiting for the technician to arrive for the 4th time and they did not show. Not even a courtesy call after I called at 9am to confirm he would arrive before 10am and again at 10:30am where they told me he would arrive sometime today. I took off work, wasted vacation hours and still no call. There level of service has been ridiculous over the past couple of weeks. Here's the breakdown:\r\n\r\nLoyal Customer going on 4 years and now wrapping up my second 2 year- contract. I pay close to $220 every month ($2640 per year) and do not have any premium channels nor the fastest internet service available. I rent modem/router from them and pay extra for it. In good standing. Wife works from home as a real estate agent and needs the internet service desperately for all of the obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst Appointment: Friday Sept 9th - Courtesy call was provided\r\n(Tech fixed the problem and it all stopped working a few hours after he left)\r\nTuesday Sept 13th: 14min troubleshooting (appointment set again/Never showed)\r\nFriday Sept 16th - 5:02pm (advised they called the wrong number. Called my wife)\r\nFriday - Sept 16th: 11 min\r\nSunday Sept 18th - 8:01pm- 22min\r\nTuesday - Sept 20th: 20 min\r\nTuesday Sept 20th- 8:40 pm-25 min (Hung Up)\r\nTuesday: Sept 20th - 9:13pm - 31 minutes (albert and ticket # CR633319360.

I was told he was dispatched)\r\nSept 21st - 10:35am for 33min - (I was stood up. Eric new Tier 2 tech advises that the ticket was still open and they will be at my residence today without a doubt. I stayed home from work. New ticket number: CR633437525\r\n** I took off work first a half day. Then the entire day. 8 hours wasted*** No courtesy call.\r\nSept 21st: 9:30pm (Appointment reads for Saturday online). still no service at home.\r\n\r\nThe abuse has been tremendous. Their neglect and lack of consideration must be addressed. They could have escalated the ticket by now and they still do not. I filed a complete with the FCC and BBB. We'll see how long it takes them to resolve my issue.", "Do they forget not everyone in OUR USA is a democratic, left wing, USA hater? In fact most of us that have them as our internet provider are RIGHT WING, REPUBLICANS, USA LOVERS, and pay our bills on time, and work for a living. I guess it is just fact that NBC, Xfinity, Comcast, and all the rest of the companies push the left wing, commie, politically correct BS. When Ma Bell finally ends up with DIRECTV next year I will say, \"See ya Comcast,\" and hopefully you will move ALL your holdings to Iran, Syria, Russia, or some other ** country where they will pray to come back to the Land of the Free and The Home of the Brave, and stand up for the Star-Spangled Banner, and kneel to thank the Lord for ALL we have and all we have given to this WORLD! God bless to all!", "We would like to file a formal complaint against Comcast for lack of ethics, lack of providing services that we fully paid for, conveniently now they have lost \r\n\r\n***Note to approver: Already posted in another site - http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Comcast-Business-Services/nationwide/Comcast-Business-Services-Comcast-Internet-Service-Provider-for-Businesses-Deceived-pre-1337021 ***\r\n\r\nall records of the numerous times each and every month that their services were faulty and we could not conduct business during our business hours. Now, when we finally switched our services to AT&T who can provide consistent service without such interruptions. 2 and a half years ago our business was able to purchase an office instead of renting one. We asked Comcast to transfer our service to the building right next to the one we were in at that time. It was not a new service, but a transfer of service. However, their deceitful sales representative and the hidden clause within the contract (way down in the fine print) stated that the transfer of service meant we signed a new 3-year contract. Why would a transfer services contract have anything to do with starting new services? It is just another way to scam their customers and continue to rake the payments in and not invest in the quality of their services.\r\n\r\nWe run a small business dealing with hundreds of other companies across the nation, and handle their upset customers. Every part of our business depends upon reliable internet services; including ring central for all faxes and Voice Over IP (where the phones are recorded via our internet as well). For a small business we spent a pretty penny every month to Comcast. It is absolutely MANDATORY for the internet to function in order for our business to operate. Over the last year we have had at least 2 or more times a month when our whole office comes to a stand-still because of Comcasts inability to provide the services that were promised. We had 10 employees sitting waiting, costing the company money paying them to wait for an indeterminable amount of time for Comcast to make their services operable again. We even added another modem to act as a backup when Comcast went down (paying AT&T to fill in when Comcast could not do their job). Rediculous!\r\n\r\nWe had Supervisors, techs, we had multiple representatives all speak with us about the lack of services; all promising that they would fix the problem. We were informed that the contract could indeed be terminated without penalty if we could prove they did not provide the service that we were paying for. Miraculously, the numerous phone calls made to them are now non-existent and they only have record of us calling one time for support in September!\r\n\r\nIn closing, Comcast has failed to provide the services that the sold our company on. We paid for these services without discounts or refunds for the hours upon hours of receiving no service at all and still paying for 10 employees to wait until they (Comcast) can fix their service. Only for it to fail again in another day or two. Ultimately, they should be paying our company for the lack of services, deceitful sales, falsifying records and evidence, and they should pay for all the wages we had to pay due to their negligence. They want to still charge our company for the remaining balance of the contract, but they cannot provide the service. Please, if you are looking for internet services for your teenage child; you may be ok with Comcast. When your business needs to have vital services that you pay handsomely for, we urge you to consider using another provider who wont lose the many recorded calls for help due to their technical service interruptions. You do not want Comcast who falsifies records to say you did not call for help just so they can continue to charge when they know they are wrong. Look at another Service Provider!", "For no known reason, my internet went out on 10/23/2016 - it had been working very well since roughly 7/4/2016, which is shortly after I moved to a new apartment. The afternoon of 10/23, I was catching up with my friends on social media when the page failed to load and there was a message that said it would not load/could not be accessed. First I checked my Wifi links to my laptop and discovered that the Xfinity Wifi (an unsecured network) was active rather than my Home Base (a secured network); then I called the automated line to try to get my modem reset; finally, after waiting ages for the reset, the automated system transferred me over to the tech support line - something I had NOT requested. \r\n\r\nThe rep was very rude and insensitive; first he laughed at me, then he cold-transferred me to another line. If I did not live in a historic building, I would have switched internet/cable providers LONG ago! And the cost! It's criminal. There's got to be a better way to get internet and cable TV - there's got to be a company that cares about its customers, treats them like human beings, and doesn't rob them blind. I feel like I'm stuck in a toxic relationship and can't escape.", "BE WARNED. You will have 10$ hidden fees when you sign up for this service. They charge you extra for the local news stations and a fee for local sports that you will not be told about until you see it on your first bill. The customer service people are a JOKE and rude rude rude. If you ask for a manager they will get snotty and never let you talk to one... I know they have attractive packages to get you hooked but it's a joke and you will pay more in the long run than the competitors.", "I started trying to cancel my Xfinity subscription in an online chat with them which they said they would help me and wasted about 20 minutes of my time before they told me I had to call retention at the number they provided me which I did. And then after talking to them for about five to ten minutes they said I would have to call back tomorrow to talk to retention to cancel my service. To which I said \"I thought I was talking to someone in the retention department,\" which she replied she was retention but could not cancel my service today and that I would have to call the same number again tomorrow.", "Had them from 2014 to now. I'd tell new customers to run but there is nowhere to run to. I tried, but it turned out Comcast was Xfinity. Signing up for a contract has no meaning. The fine print in the contract that they suggest you read when they randomly change a contract says they can change anything anytime and are not doing anything wrong. I disagree. I have or had performance pro, paying for a speed of internet a month under a contract. Not month to month alone. The speed is not listed or told to you just it's between 25 and 50.\r\n\r\nI got a letter Friday saying Tue (today) I'm being forced into a new contract plan. I'm now paying for my data at the same speed with a cap of a terabyte. Seems like a lot but it's not and not what I signed up for. But all customer service says is that's the deal now. They don't offer plans by just speed it's changed. Those who use more Internet should pay more. It's not fair to the other customers. What does it matter fair it's what we signed up to use. I use firestick. We stream everything all day. It's frustrating. They kept saying it's the same, but if I use more just go to the unlimited plan for only $50 more. I don't have 150$. It's why we got rid of direcTV for firestick. Paying for an unlimited speed to being changed to pay for data is a huge difference. All they can say is, \"You won't know there was a change unless you go over 1000. The closest you got so far was 980 and we won't charge you for going over the first 2 months to get used to it.\" \r\n\r\nWhen I first went to talk to someone at the store they didn't want to talk to me and told me I needed to call billing. They don't know about it. How can they not help or explain if we pay bills there and get equipment there. After a minute the guy called someone over who is good at explaining the letter. So now they know about the letter and someone can explain it. They just didn't want to deal with it in the store. So the other guy comes over and lies to us as well. Tells us the letter got sent to everyone but is only for new customers, not us. Whatever I know it's all a lie. \r\n\r\nWe leave and today I call Comcast. As soon as you call it asks if you are calling about your data. Say yes and it directs the call to someone who only knows to say, \"Read your contract and there is nothing you can do.\" They don't know anything. You need billing. Then why did it put the call to somewhere that can't help. It's the run around. The last guy I talked to is what is above. How can they be the only internet around. So I'm forced to pay by data now and I don't even get a better speed for being gypped. It's also wrong - I only got notified Friday. That Tuesday Nov 1st the change takes effect.", "Charges overwhelming. Comcast service rep was so ignorant and rude when I call to resolve my issue with my bill. I emailed Tom ** his rep was rude to me. None of the representative was helpful. They all just pass me on to other people. I am cutting my service with Comcast.", "It took Comcast a long time to set up my service. It was almost two month before we had cable and internet in our home. It was an inconvenience. But everything else was fine. The customer service was always really nice and very friendly. But we have had a few issues with the speed of our internet and loading times. We were signed up for a higher speed and just weren't getting what we thought we were paying for. And it will get better from time to time.", "Installation went well with no problems. The technician was average and he didn't go above and beyond. He didn't speak much but was respectful. And then the only time I worked with customer service was a billing issue but the representative was nice and did not put me on hold long. Also, the speed was good. Unlike satellite and others it never had lagging. It worked well for my family considering how many of were using multiple devices at the same time. We were never fighting over the wifi signal. You get what you pay for and the more money you pay the better the speed.", "When we moved into this house Comcast was here within the time frame they said, though I feel the time frame is too big. The person that did the installation was polite, considerate and very professional. So far our customer service experiences have been really good. They have been able to answer our questions and fix the problem within a reasonable amount of time. Reliability of the service is also good. We very rarely lose service and if we do it's back within a couple hours. The customer service with an outage is quite good and if there is another problem then they will come fix it with little to no problems. Personally I think the speed is good but my husband says it's slow. Since he knows more about computers than I do I will believe him. Though for my personal needs it's fine.", "When I first called to have the internet hooked up the operator was very helpful, explained everything to me, the packages, speeds, about broadband, etc!!! Wonderful customer service. The installation was easy and fast! The tech came out and wasn't here long at all and we haven't had any problems with our net at all! I've not had any dropped signal, high speed is always fast. We have multiple computers, tablets, phones running at the same time on any given day but it's still high speed on all of the gadgets. Not like some of them that I have had. I definitely recommend this company.", "The internet installation process did not take long. The nice man came in and hooked everything up for me and my family, definitely glad I chose Xfinity. I live in Colorado and the internet service never went down, even in snow. It was reliable and I love it. The speed was great too and it never slowed down. The customer service was great as well. My call was answered quickly and I never had a problem. I enjoy Xfinity and would definitely recommend it to all family and friends.", "The Comcast installer came on time. He was neat, respectful, and worked quickly and efficiently. All parts that were needed for the job were available. Customer service representatives are always kind and courteous and ready to help. I have had no service interruptions and always reliable service. Speed is more than enough for my needs. I have had no issues with reduced speed or lagging so I have no complaints over the years of service.", "The installation was on time, and fast and friendly. Everything was explained to us by the employee in a understanding way making it easier for us to navigate the system. We received good customer care on the phone and in person. They took the time to answer all our questions and show us how to work the system easier. My internet was ok and we're satisfied with the speed most of the time but when the wind was high or raining out or a heavy snow it would cut in and out constantly sometimes cutting off for hours and days before being able to be fixed.", "The man who came and installed our internet was very respectful and helpful in explaining things he felt I needing to know about Xfinity. He came a little later than the scheduled time but it didn't take too long. The internet usually works, but runs very slowly at times and also cuts out often. Another thing is that it depends how many people are using it and how far away you are from the router. Also the router occasionally turns off and we have to reset on our own. We have called customer service about trying to get a new router because of all the connected issues, but have yet to receive one. A new router would help resolve the issues instead of being a temporary fix.", "We chose to do a self install which was a very easy install process. I chose to use my own router so that took a while to connect with but customer service was there to help throughout the process. I was on the phone with them when I did my self install and they were very knowledgeable and understanding. They made sure I had a solution to all my problems and was satisfied with my products and services. Then I am always able to connect to my wifi on each device simultaneously. We have at least ten different devices connected at the same time without any lagging or disconnection. The loading time is very quick and I have downloaded multiple movies and apps instantly without having to wait long periods.", "When the installers showed up they were late. The guy was extremely rude and had a very foul mouth on him. I could not believe he would talk like he did in a customer's house. Also, every time I call them they always just have the same thing to say at all times, \"Just restart the modem.\" This company really needs to figure it out. I am very dissatisfied with the customer service that I have received with this company and what reliability? Their internet is horrible. The wifi won't connect half the time to our phones and very laggy on my laptop, phones and smart tv. Also, it is extremely slow. Half the time it takes like 5 minutes to open a webpage and the tv will just cut off during an app.", "My internet installation experience was not very good. My technician was late over 45 minutes and could not hook up all the equipment at that time and had me take another day off of work. Also, I have purchased pay-per-views from Comcast and during the time that the event is live my connection is horrible and won't even load the program. This is completely unacceptable because I should be able to rely on the connection when there is a live event to be able to be there. If that is not there then there is no reliability. Also, customer service does not address your concerns and the whole time so ridiculous. He expected to wait at least 30 minutes and be transferred through multiple departments before somebody that can actually help you with what you're calling about is available. The speed of this product is very good, though. But because of the reliability and the customer service the speed of the product is basically the only good thing about it.", "I am very happy with Comcast, I am just not happy with the cost. Plus we get prebilled for our service which is not right. If the cost was a little less it would help million of people but the company is all about the money not their customers. The installation was not as I expected, and they used the wire that had already been in this house for over twenty years. I did like the person that came out but they were not in a Comcast vehicle which is what I would expect not a outside contractor. Customer service are very friendly when I go in and need assistance. They really know their jobs and are a pleasure to deal with, it makes having my service through them a little more enjoyable. It's an easy in and out when I go to the place of business and when they activated my service it took them less than thirty minutes.", "I have had 3 other Internet Service Providers and Comcast is far and away fastest of them all. It can also handle up to 5 devices at the same time with no noticeable \"drag\". I have been on Xfinity for 2 years, and I have lost service for about four (4) hours ONE in that time!!! If that is not reliable, I don't know what is. Great service. Also, the installer was very professional, and, knowledgeable, and completed my installation in a timely manner. He was personable, and \"went the extra mile\" to provide an excellent experience. However, customer service is probably the Achilles Heel of the operation, and, I say that only because some reps are extremely knowledgeable while others seem untrained. Conceivably you to speak to 4 reps and get 4 DIFFERENT answers.", "The installers came out and showed up early. They had everything installed in about one hour maybe a little under a hour and they didn't charge me a thing for it. Comcast has reliable and good signal strength. The service is excellent and it's not choppy. We run lot on our wifi and we have excellent signals too. Comcast's prices are great too.\r\n\r\nCustomer service is reliable and there when you need them. If they can't fix problem they send someone out fast. Also they speak English so I like the communication factors big time. That makes it a lot easier to call with a issue and understand them to get the issues resolved. Overall, they have good service that I love.", "Speed is wonderful. I'm coming from Optimum, and that speed sucks. I work at home so I need my internet speed to be fast and Verizon does that for me. I'm so happy with Verizon! Installation was great too. I loved the guy that came to install, he was very nice and friendly. He was sweet to my kids, and even had them help him pass tools. Customer service is amazing too! Every time I call I get through quickly. It's awesome because I'm never upset. I don't like it when companies have long wait times, they should just hire more people like Verizon does. Each customer service representative has a story to tell. The service is very reliable. I love that Verizon is always on top of its game when it comes to fast internet service. They are largest internet service provider in the country!", "You can have this internet service installed by a technician at initial setup of service, but it is a simple do it yourself setup, even for the not tech savvy consumers. I can always count on my internet working with great speeds even on older computers. We only had short outage during severe storms where there was also other issues with electric & such. Just like the reliability, no matter what computer I have ran or what software is on the computer, the speed has always been top notch. Also, no matter when you call or what the reason your call is you generally get a happy, cheerful customer service agent. There are always those few that just hate their job or life in general, but overall great customer service.", "The speed is extremely fast and reliable, all of my things load very easily and smoothly. Sometimes we would have problems, but when we called for help the problems were easily fixable and from then on we had no problems. The people who came to install it were very nice, clean, and it didn't take them a very long time. When I called customer service I was connected very fast and the representatives were very nice and friendly. It was an overall good service and my family loves it. I would recommend this service to all of my friends!", "Comcast is one of the fastest, most reliable services I have ever had. It was so easy to use and downloaded things in a matter of minutes. Great for online gaming and was never laggy. Always easy to navigate. A friendly, thoughtful, and very spot on time wise installation person. Fast and very informative when installing. He also showed how to troubleshoot if you had any issues. Customer service was always friendly, with prompt responses, easy to talk to if you had issues, always was ready to solve any problem you had and always a smile on their face when helping you.", "Installation took all day, had to rewire for some reason. Was told it would be quick but wasn't, and the employee actually complained about it as if it was our fault. And after the long installation process, we found out we were billed for it, which the said employee neglected to inform us. He wasn't even very helpful when we asked him direct questions, about things he should have been able to answer for us, and also seemed rude and bothered by our questions. Nonetheless, our internet service is always up, high-speed reliability and has not let us down so far. Downloads and uploads are always extremely fast, and the distance that the wireless internet cover is also quite vast. It's the quickest speed of wireless internet I have had so far. There hasn't been a lag of any kind.", "Operating in 40 states, Comcast is the United States' largest cable operator. Using DOCSIS 3.0 Comcast customers see download speeds up to 505 Mbps and upload speeds up to 100 Mbps. Comcast HighSpeed Internet is now called \"XFINITY Internet\". However, I recently start having problems with speed of internet now I am having a problem getting someone to resolve the issue. Cannot get a customer service rep in the United States and when you ask to speak with one, they put you on hold or hang up. Then when I went into the store I dealt with Tiffany, she handled all of my concerns quickly and knowledgeably. So if you are struggling with the service reps on the phone, visit this store.", "Comcast's installers showed up within the window that was given and installed and set everything up pretty quickly. We often have 3 or 4 phones using the wifi and sometimes even have a movie or TV show streaming at the same time with no lag or loading issues. We never have outages in service unless the power is actually out. I very rarely have to contact customer service but they have always been helpful and nice during our conversation and the wait times has also been not that long.  Moreover, they are easy to communicate with and are forgiving of a late payment here and there.", "Comcast always had signal and worked very well. Even if it was raining, or really windy outside, my signal was still strong. It's very reliable. Installation happened very fast and efficiently. The installer was very kind and did an excellent job at getting my internet set up. I also could have it locked, so my neighbors couldn't use my internet. The speed of the internet is very fast, and I rarely lagged. Customer Service was very nice and helped me solve any problems, if I came across any. They were never rude or short with me. They stayed on the phone with me 'til the issue was solved. I would recommend this service to anyone.", "Internet service and reliability has been excellent. Been a customer for over ten years with very limited, short outages. It's much more reliable than DSL. I performed my own installation (purchased cable modem and wireless router), however, when service degraded a bit, Comcast sent a technician who quickly identified the issue and installed a signal booster which greatly improved reliability and performance. Comcast has not been known for its customer service, but it is improving over time. Their new campaign focusing on customer service is a good one. I have the Performance Pro tier of service with simultaneous usage across multiple family members. Both upload and download speeds are excellent.", "The installation was ok considering we installed everything ourselves. Comcast would provide installation but they charged so much and it was basically nonsense having them come out. Plus, their customer service is rude and not helpful at all. They could not ever provide the answers that I was looking for or asking for and would always just keep deferring me to another department or another person. Also, they always seemed to change the pricing from month to month, with no good explanation of the changes. Internet was ok but not great, but it was usually reliable when needed and it was pretty fast as long as there wasn't too many users on at one time. But there are four people in my household that use the internet and that caused it to be slow at times.", "I have been having issues with my internet gateway (supplied by Comcast) for over a year. At least twice each day my gateway loses the connection and does a total reset. Not only does this interrupt my internet connection but also my phone service. Multiple times I have been on important telephones with clients only to have my phone service go dead. Not to mention all the times I have been using the internet for work and have it untimely disconnect. Over the past 12+ months I have made approximately three dozen calls to their support center and have had a dozen plus technicians come to my home. Unfortunately each time a technician is scheduled, I need to be home to wait for them. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of the technicians have resolved the issue. The last time a supervisor came, changed a few wires, and gave me his number ** to call if I was still having issues. After placing 3 calls to him over the past 2 weeks he has not returned my call. Two people from their corporate office called and gave me their numbers. The first number (800) 597-6022 x-** has not returned my call after me leaving numerous voice messages. The second person (800) 597-6022 x-** at least answers her phone, however she has not been able to get the service supervisor to return my call.\r\n\r\nI don't think I am asking for too much. All I want them to do is resolve the issue. They can start by returning calls. Further attempt to resolve the issue by refraining from sending the same skill level technicians to my home. If the first 11 technicians with the same skill level could not resolve the issue what makes them think the 12th technician with the same skill level will do any better! It is really poor and unacceptable customer service when multiple calls to different company representatives are not returned.", "It's my belief that Comcast agents are poorly trained. I just completed calls to them about my service, and was transferred from \"expert\" to expert, but in the end, my service was not restored, and I currently have no internet provider (Xfinity) because of my upcoming move. No expert at Comcast can reinstate my account, and I just might have to take Comcast to small claims court. The cable service was very good, but now that I use wifi exclusively it does not work at all. I'm currently using a hotspot at our free public library.", "I made an account specifically to write a review for Comcast and their horribly rebranded \"Xfinity\" internet service. I moved away from NYC recently where we had Time Warner as our provider for TV, phone, and internet, and I'm starting to miss the days of having to call them once a month to sort out an issue. Xfinity is spotty at best even when it's working \"properly\". We do our best to turn the wifi off of all devices that aren't in use so there are at most 3 or 4 devices connected at a given time. The most intensive of which is generally only one device streaming and possibly a gaming console in use at the same time. Every other device is generally just browsing light web pages or news apps. Constant buffering and inconsistent connection speeds are always an issue. Whenever we reset the router and test the speeds we have a few minutes of decent speed before it goes down again.\r\n\r\nBeyond the slow and inconsistent connection speeds, at least once a day without fail the connection will drop entirely and we have to restart our modem. When calling Comcast we almost always get a nonsensical machine telling us that service is entirely down in the area, which is simply not true, because after a 10 minute restart process it's restored...for the time being. So getting ahold of anyone is a process in and of itself. When we finally get a human on the phone they clearly don't have any kind of acceptable training and are as blind to the issues as we are.\r\n\r\nHorrible service and the only reason we are sticking with it is because there literally aren't any other providers in this area. And this is without even getting into the issues with our television service. There genuinely isn't a rating low enough to give to this terrible service with even worse support. Even if on paper the alternatives aren't better, trust me, go with them instead. With the new 1TB data caps per month rolling out nationwide there is even less reason to give your money to these dirtbags.", "I spent over an hour on chat with \"Jacob\". I told him what my family needs were, and that we've been with a competitor since 2006. He comes back and says \"Sign up today for a two year agreement and for a limited time only, you can get a Visa Card up to $200 (based on the plan selected). Would you like to know more?\" I say \"tell me more.\" So he goes on to recommend a plan for me, that I feel was a pretty good deal. However, he COMPLETELY forgets to tell me that the plan HE suggested disqualifies me for the $200 Visa... just never brings it up again until the end when I say, I don't see the $200 Visa on the Final Order. He apologizes for the confusion, I need to get a package that CLEARLY isn't suited for me AND will costs me an additional $110/month for the first 2 years and then an additional $60 month after that. WHAT?\r\n\r\nThis ladies and gentlemen is called BAIT & SWITCH. He KNEW good and well that we were not suited for the Plan that would qualify us for the $200 Visa. Well... it gets worse. I ask him to speak to a manager and he REFUSES to let me communicate with a Manager - tells me \"manager will tell me the same thing.\" I have never had Xfinity/Comcast whatever this is, but I cannot believe that they would engage in such shadiness. I told him that I hope corporate agrees with their handling of my situation because I will certainly be sharing. I'll see what corporate thinks, but clearly, I am unimpressed and very disappointed with my experience today.", "I have been Comcast customer since 2009. My house was build in 2013. I pay $99.06 for internet extreme 150. According to the customer solution I should be getting 150 mbps but since I move to the extreme 150 I have not been able pass 84-91 mbps. So I call multiple times - Hours and speaking with several 2nd tier tech support and none of them are able to find why I can't get over 100 mbps.\r\n\r\nThen two tech came in house and nothing change. They don't know what is the issue. After several days and fees, someone in Comcast was able to tell me the conclusion. CONCLUSION - Comcast does not guarantee 150 mbps - it is up to 150 mbps but the marketing department wrote this FK add and it is all over the internet-TV advertising speed up to 200 mbps.\r\n\r\nIT IS A JOKE - I challenged Comcast support tier 3 and customer solution to proof that they test the speed connectivity from their demark to my residence ending point - NOTHING. I ask for another Tech to come in my house and ask him to test speed from my endpoint to their Demark. I saw the tech with a stupid device that they Carry around to check connection. The tech device checked the speed and the result was 21-26 mbps and my computer shows 83 mbps. That rule that my hardware is fine. So then the tech told me it is marketing. I tried AT&T and Verizon but ONLY Comcast is allow in my resident area. JOKE - CONSUMERAFFAIRS - if you read this review, you should investigate this scam from Comcast.", "Comcast is awful! I met Tauni ** at a job fair. She didn't know what she was talking about. I think she was intoxicated. She also had tattoos all over her body, a nose ring, and these gross holes in her ears. Maybe she represents the ** at Comcast? Good for Comcast?!? They like **? She also never followed up with me. She did not have any cards to hand out either. She smells like **, cigarettes, and alcohol. It was gross. If you are a **, go work at Comcast in Utah. I'd rather work at McDonald's. That's for the call back Tauni at Comcast!", "On a Game Day in Knoxville, Tn they know how everyone loves to watch the VOLS. This cable company along with Infinity had the worse reception ever you could not even watch the game. This is the only cable company we can get are the Comcast/Infinity with are the same ones that's why they own us like KUB. We have to have it. This company really sucks. Do not ever get this either place. They say Infinity is another company but why they are in same building and same trucks just different lettering?", "Got overcharged. Told refund coming on next bill. It was partial. Contacted, told the rest would be on next bill. That was also partial. Contacted them, they played dumb about the chain of events, only commenting on the current refund, which was already more generous than what I was asking for (since they didn't know about the previous amount). That's not how math works, and they don't know it. TL;DR if you're owed a refund, make sure you get it in one fell swoop or you won't get it all.", "I was informed that I could get much internet speeds of 200 mbps, and 10 basic channels for price A, if I signed a contract for 1 year. I liked the deal, and signed up for contract. Thereafter, I realized that I was getting only 100 mbps (instead of the 200 mbps). I followed up several times with Comcast customer support, and every time got different answers.\r\n\r\nFinally, the loyalty department representative claimed that I should be flexible to some human error, and that I was misinformed about the speeds. There is nothing that he could do to fix the plan (unless I paid more to upgrade my tier to get the desired speeds). They don't even provide you the contract that you signed with them. So, always make sure that you have an electronic trail to avoid them from flipping on their words. This is a brazen theft when they acknowledge human errors, but are not ready to rectify it (and more importantly get you for full year contract with their services). Will never recommend anyone to sign up with this company.", "If the service would be reliable, I could possibly give 2-3 stars. I have experienced daily outages at any time of the day. I pay for service so that I can turn on my Smart TV and watch cable TV or use the internet when it is convenient for me. The repeated outages totally prevents convenience and the experience of enjoying the service. I believe Xfinity is only using temporary fixes for the outages instead of actually creating or replacing equipment for a permanent fix. It doesn't mater if it rains or shines, the service is temperamental.", "This Comcast company is scam, and a disgrace with no respect to consumers rights. Comcast does false advertisement and incorrect billing and refuses change the billing cycle to work with disabled consumers who don\u2019t get paid until the 3rd of every month and then want to falsely hit them with unfair late fees on their Comcast account. Comcast sending threatening notices of disconnection on services and refusing to give consumers proof of payment received of $69.20 falsely claiming they never received payment then wanting to hit me with a bill of $239.23 due on 26th of every month. This is highway robbery from Comcast and this is a direct violation of my consumer rights and it discriminates against consumers with disabilities and I consider this harassment. I will join any petition or any class action lawsuit against Comcast Corporation.", "We had poor internet service. Comcast confirmed there was a problem with their equipment outside our home and told us we had to be present because the technician had to come in the house before he completed his service. We made an appointment for service on the Sunday following Thanksgiving which required we make a special 2-1/2 hour trip from out-of-town to meet the technician. We were at our home in advance of the appointment time, and we responded to several robo-calls to confirm our presence.\r\n\r\nWe actually received a robo-call saying the tech was here and we should go greet him. We went to the door and no one was there. We walked outside and did not see a Comcast truck on the street. We assumed he needed to start his investigation around the corner. When no one showed up for almost an hour, I called back to Comcast, and after staying on the line for almost an hour, we finally were told that the technician had been to the wrong house and had left and they could not get that or any other technician back out. Our service was still not working so we had to reschedule. What a frustrating waste of time!!", "I had been trying to have services installed in my home at **. They have rescheduled me twice because the technician said the work that needs to be done they can't do it. How do you run a business scheduling appointments and not sending qualified technician to handle the job. It took them almost 4 weeks to install and they want me to pay for services since the beginning of the month when I just got services installed on 3/15 so why would should I pay for services I never had and only credited me 20 towards installation when they charged me 70. This is unacceptable and poor customer service.", "Comcast takes the cake of being the WORST company when I thought AT&T was horrible! Since I signed up in December 2016, it has been a nightmare dealing with Zachery ** who totally lied regarding what he had offered me followed by Eugene ** and Andrea-Marie ** who by the way are \"managers.\" My bill is always going up month after month without any explanations. When I called no one seems to know what's going on, not even those two managers who claimed they would help and don't replied back to your emails, phone calls, and follow through with their words. I have to call them every month regarding my bill to the point I scheduled for my services to get disconnected in April. If you don't have the time and energy to deal with this company stay far, far away. They are NOT worth your time and energy.", "Now that Comcast has released 2 months ago that you are limited to 1024 gig of data before extra charge kicks in, and sent out a usage report of what you have been using to make you feel better about getting a cap. Has anybody else noticed they are using a lot more data than before? I work from home and I'm on the computer 10 hrs. a day and watch Netflix while I'm working and we had been around for our average 650 gig. Last month and this month I have been over by 550 to 600 gig. So I call to find out what the overage cost is and lo and behold it's $10 per 50 gig or you can go unlimited for 50 a month more. Well there it is. Give us another 50 and you get unlimited. Interesting. Now this month after adding the 50 unlimited plan I see a 60 dollar overage and when I call I was told that is credited and my bill should be 286 yet the paper statement and the online statement both show 346 due. Lies all around.", "I've had Comcast internet service for about 3 years now as I have no other choice. Since we first became customers we have had rolling internet outages. In other words our internet will slow to down to bits per second range down from the 25 megabits our subscription is for. I've talked regularly with tech support at first and they would go through the same steps each time ignoring my interruptions that I've gone through their script many times. They eventually send a technicians out to look at the service. I believe we've had 4 out, and each time they say everything is fine, and everything is fine in the middle of the day usually. It's between 6 pm and 12 pm when we have the worst problems, exactly the time we are home and want to use the service we pay for.\r\n\r\nComcast has never offered to give us any kind of outage refund. They have horrible over the phone tech support, they actually try to upsell me at the end of each phone call. The techs they send out seem knowledgeable but when I've tried to follow up with them with screenshots of speed tests they have not responded. At this point I don't have time to continue to devote to troubleshooting with them and I have no other providers servicing my location. Did I mention I live in Denver, so it's not like there are miles of cables to troubleshoot here. I would like to end this monopoly.", "I am writing this review to warn others not to make the same mistake I did. I signed up for 2 year contract. We have had that contract 13 months. In that 13 months we have lost ALL service 15x!!! Some days we have had to wait 8 hours for the tech to show up, only for them to be 1 hour late. The customer service is horrible. I was treated very rudely when I was trying to explain that I needed phone service for my 80 yo mother in case of emergency. They could give 2 craps about our situation. THE FCC NEEDS TO PULL THEIR LICENSE!!!! This is not a \"service\" but a money grabbing. Heed my advice.. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!! 15 hours on the phone, 5 days waiting, and only $4.00 WORTH OF CREDIT!", "*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nReview already published at: http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Comcast/nationwide/Comcast-Xfinity-Nationwide-1335656\r\n*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nIf you search the Internet for Comcast Refund Check Scams you will see where thousands of people have been dubbed by this company after turning off their service. It's as though Comcast is penalizing us for choosing to go with another company by not returning what we over paid to them or whatever the reason they owe the customer money. If it was us owing them you'd better believe they would have our account in collections so fast and they know it.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I turned my service off with them around May 2016 and over paid them $41.64. I was told Id be getting a refund in 30-45 days. June I inquired about the check and was told it hadn't been processed yet. July I called was told the check was mailed on July 13th and cashed July 21. I informed them I didn't cash the check and by right they should mail out a replacement check. I was told no replacement check would be mailed out. Right there I knew something was fishy.\r\n\r\nEach time Id call in to speak with a representative or a supervisor to ask why a replacement check couldn't be sent they would accuse me on the sly of cashing the check by telling me to look into my deposits in my bank account because I may have forgot.\r\n\r\nWhen that didn't work the financial department of Comcast sent me out a fraud packet saying only the ORIGINAL COPIES would be accepted within a certain time limit. It was dated and stamped within those limits. However, Elinor J, one of the Corporate Executives, sent me a letter accusing me of not cooperating by not sending in the fraud papers. Had I not made copies of what I mailed in she may have gotten away with her claim.\r\n\r\nI drove to the financial center in georgia using the address that it came from with the hopes of speaking with someone in person and I had a copy of the fraud packet with me. They made copies of my copy of what I mailed in. After I left a message on Elinors phone scolding her for making that false statement about me not being cooperative by not mailing in the original fraud packet she had no other choice but to make a few phone calls and change her tune otherwise the investigation would have stopped right then and there if there really is an investigation going on.\r\n\r\nAs far as the check being sent and cashed that is debatable. When the finance department sent me the fraud packet they also sent me a copy of the check. The check has no indications that it was cashed. There's no signature, no financial institution on the back, and no dates stamped. When I brought this to their attention the story changed again with them saying the check was cashed electronically through MY BANK. I don't have an account with Mellon Bank Comcast does. And as far as Mellon Bank issuing me a check that in itself is fishy because my account was with Comcast; I over paid them $41.64 not Mellon Bank\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think there's an investigation going on because no one can keep me informed or updated as to who cashed the check and when will I get my replacement check. I don't need Corporate Relations to call asking how they can help me, or call telling me they will submit a ticket, or tell me someone will call me back with more information. The problem with all of these scenarios is [1] I have enough tickets submitted by them that I can probably open my own ticket business - nothing ever becomes of these tickets they submit. [2] when I do get a call back through a submitted ticket it's from another Customer Relations executive who cannot help me and so the call again is meaningless. And this cycle goes on and on and on. These Comcast executives will leave their name and number for me to call them back but I'm reluctant to do that because they can't really help me. They can only submit tickets like rest of the other call center representatives These so called Corporate Executives [which is only a fancy name given to call center reps that are centralized on the east coast specifically Philadelphia] should know before they call me they should have all their ducks in row, their is dotted and ts crossed. Call me with answers and not meaningless conversation.\r\n\r\nOne Comcast Executive, left a note on my account stating the issue about my refund has been resolved. Meaning, they have successfully passed the responsibility off of them to Mellon Bank. They know Mellon Bank will not discuss anything with me or anyone else because I don't have an account with them. Any time I call in or someone calls them about this issue they can refer to this note and all investigations stop there because they know Mellon Bank will not disclose anything", "My cable and internet quit working on 12/15/2016. I called Comcast and was told that they were sending a tech out at 3:30 p.m. No contact from them. I called back at 3:30 p.m. Got someone that could not speak English. I ask to speak to someone and he just kept on talking. I called a 3rd time and explained that my cable and internet was not working and was told that there was a signal issue in my house so they just cut it off because it affects everyone else. \r\n\r\nI was also told that there was a note left on my door from them. And also there was never a ticket put in for a tech to come to my house. My husband was home all day. He said that no one came to our house. There were not any tire tracks in our yard. When I told the tech this she replied \"oh yes they said that they ran out of the stickers.\" So they just cut everything off with no warning. She also told me that It may be sometime tomorrow before I get my cable and internet back. I pay this company over 250.00 a month. No excuse!!!", "Apologize for the grammar. Was just on customer service line for over 45 min. I have been going back and forth with customer service for over 10 times since the beginning of this year. This is way too much.

It is always going out. Have had their repair guys out multiple time. If the wind blows it goes out. If it is cold it goes out. If it get too hot it goes out. Repair people can't seem to find anything wrong but leaves a phone number to call them, but they never answer, so feel just getting lip service. We pay our bill on time and is very expensive service for bad service.", "Three and a half months ago we signed up for Comcast's dual package. Their contract installer came out and was able to get two of the four TVs we wanted on cable. He also ran a new cable from the utility pole to the house although he indicated we needed a heavier cable to get more signal to the other two sets. He was to contact maintenance to have them out the next day to hang the better cable. We are still waiting for that individual to show up. Then, the cable he ran hangs only about 6 feet off the ground instead of the 9 feet of our original cable. After two more trips across the next month by a Comcast installer they finally got all four televisions on cable.\r\n\r\nNow, after numerous phone calls to Comcast's service line and promises that \"they'll be there tomorrow\" statements we still have a cable that hits people in the head when in the backyard. I have to say that we do enjoy the channels we receive and the high-speed internet, it is a pain when I call and either can't understand their operator, they don't understand the problem because it isn't in their computer and promises that are worse than whistling in the wind.", "My experience with Comcast has been the most horrible experience that I've encountered with any company. I have tried for 3 Days To have my service connected. Only Internet for some reason. I have gone all the way to the executive corporate office to complain about the service that I received. After paying my past due amount they instructed me to wait for a sales representative for connection to no avail again after 3 days. Because of the area that I live in which is rural I am stuck with only Comcast services. No one has helped me. To the date I have been getting the runaround. Wrong Department wrong sales representatives all for reconnect of service. This company has monopolized the services in my city. Are there any answers for me to receive restitution for the poor service that I received? If anyone has any answers please forward them. I need help.", "If I could give them a negative star or no stars on this review I would. I have never worked with any industry with as bad of customer service as Comcast. It is not a matter of money because I make well enough above and beyond to afford their services but they are a legitimate ripoff. I think they are the biggest scam of since the mortgage industry's major meltdown and I hope I move somewhere where Comcast does not exist. The disregard to want to help or do the right thing is honestly astounding. If you have to call, which you do FOR ALL ISSUES - billing, connection/service, adding or removing service, errors, it does not matter you will be transferred minimum of 4 times. Everyone says the same thing and passes the issues to the next person and no one resolves the problem.\r\n\r\nThey offer promotional packages in small timeframes and can never access them again so they then upgrade you without you wishing and change your billing. It has been 5 months and I have been overcharged $40 a month since I started with them.

Opened up the box and tried connecting on all coax cable outlets: fail. Called customer service who said I had to have a tech come out (outside only) and would not be charged a fee assuming he did not come into the house. I agreed to an outside install ONLY. Later: After scheduling my tech, I found an email stating I now had the $50 install fee: twice of which I clearly communicated that I would not be responsible for. Later: Called customer service and made sure the $50 would come off. I was told now I had to pay another service charge and I said, \"absolutely not: take it off\".\r\n\r\nLater: I was fed up and after receiving another email confirming further unknown charges, I called and said, \"Come get your equipment and cancel me!\" They confirmed a 12/29 pick-up date. 12/18: I called since I never received a cancellation email. I was told I would receive one in 5-15 minutes. I did not. I called again and was told I would receive one in 2 hours. I did not. I called again and said I would receive one within 24 hours. 12/19: Still no cancellation email confirmation (at this point my trust was in the negative) so I called and now was told I would receive one when the tech would come to pick up my equipment on 12/29. I demanded an email sooner and was told I would receive it within 24 hours. \r\n\r\n12/21: Still no email. I called again. This time, the rep was extremely rude and self-righteous and said everything I have been told was wrong and that the tech wouldn't pick up the equipment and now I would have to go to the UPS store. The rep again said the email would come... yeah right... I doubt it. To date, I know they will be attempting to charge me for something when in fact, they should be CREDITING ME for my 4 hours spent and numerous lies received. \r\n\r\nThis is hands down the most unethical, tyrannical, grotesque, disorganized (where is their standard work instructions? THAT many reps with all COMPLETELY different messages? HOW?), and vicious company I have ever attempted to be serviced by. It must be the ownership from NBC: the lie capital of the free world. Thanks, Comcast/Xfinity. Now I CLEARLY remember why I canceled your services 6 years ago and went with AT&T: an inferior company who can at least be dealt with honestly, consistently, and fairly!

So, I called Comcast to buy internet. After calling with customer service, I asked for the regular internet package. However when I received the box I was not able to have internet and after all those frustrating calls, the customer service person told me that the internet would not work in my apartment, and I had to return the router and whatever I received. So I did it. I did not get even one day internet from Comcast company and guess what, they charged me for a month internet. This is so shameful for a big company like Comcast to make money like that.

Now they sent to my home a new bill charged a contract that I never accepted. This people are hungry money they don't care about the customers no like other companies. They are so close of mind.

I always had contact in the past and always the people doesn't want to help at all. They don't care customer. Better look for another company.", "WORST SERVICE EVER. I've had so many issues with your service after being a customer for less than two months. I was sent the wrong cable box, I've had to call for image clarity, I've had issues with my router. Spoke with a representative, had them send an agent out to my location \"for free\" and was charged $50 for it. I'm SO IRRITATED.", "I have heard Comcast customer service has consistently been some of the worse of any cable/internet provider, and what I have heard and read online is so true. I would even take it a step further and say Comcast is possibly the worse customer service I have ever seen anywhere! I have been having internet bandwidth/speed fluctuations. I spent two hours on tech support with a nice guy who was knowledgeable and diagnosed the issue with signaling errors coming from outside my house and they needed to send a technician. \r\n\r\nThe technician was supposed to come between 10-12 AM. So I took a half day off work yesterday to be here when he arrives. He apparently arrived to my door and apparently rang my doorbell twice and when no one answered he left. I got a call while I was literally sitting in my living room waiting for him (25 ft from the front door) from automated service saying a technician came and no one was home so I needed to reschedule.\r\n\r\nI immediately ran outside and found him sitting in his van in front of my house. I smiled and said \"sorry, but I am home and we didn't hear him knock or ring the doorbell\". Instead of apologizing, he said he was told he had to leave and move on to the next house. This is at 10:36 and my appointment reservation was from 10AM-Noon! I couldn't believe that he was just going to leave and not help resolve my problem. He started arguing with me that since I didn't answer the door, there was nothing else he could do and I needed to call Comcast to reschedule. Then I think he felt bad and said he would call his boss' to see if he could stay and fix my problem. Next thing, I know I go back outside and his van is gone!\r\n\r\nI call Comcast customer service that evening and of course they have no notes of a technician going out to my house and about the incident. Furthermore, they asked so what is the problem with the internet... really, I have to go through all of this again? So I tell the agent my experience and they apologize and can't believe this happened (I am sure they are programmed to apologize around the clock). They arrange to bring another technician today at 10-noon again today. Well, I waited and waited, and now they told me that the booking was made for tomorrow at 2-4 PM and not today. \r\n\r\nAnd then to top it all off, the customer service rep \"Lou\" said \"well this all wouldn't have happened if you answered your door when our technician rang the doorbell.\" Unbelievable! So, I have taken two half days off work and they have completely dropped the ball and made it completely inconvenient. My issue is not resolved and I have had to deal with the worse customer service ever.", "When I called the infinity customer service center to complain about the new slow performance speed the first question customer service asked was \"How fast is it now and why didn't you buy the previous offer for the faster service.\" I responded with \"What speed is my plan am I paying for now.\" I explained to customer service the actual test was less than half that. The customer service rep said she would resend a signal to my router. No improved speed occurred. I turned on my hotspot on my cell phone to file this complaint. I am getting screw from Comcast/Xfinity. My internet speed is not what I pay for.", "These people are unethical and disturbing oblivious to their customers needs. The internet speed tears are constantly changing and customers are being charged as the internet speeds change. For instance, when their \"blast\" service was first commissioned by me it was stated by Comcast that it was 100 Mbps. Now I see a $10.00 increase in my bill after 6 months and when speaking to a customer rep was told that it was not 100 Mbps but 75 Mbps and the blast in which I have had for 6 months plus was in fact 75 Mbps. The have added $10.00 to my bill for a service I already had. I told them to take it off and give me the 75 Mbps without the \"blast\" which I was told that it would put me to 25 Mbps. I will be shopping for another service. The end.", "So, I contacted the company to set Internet service, and a couple of days later a sales rep contacted me to offer a bundle, to which the agreement changed my connection date that they could not change. When connected, the television service was just the local channels, and was paying $10 more for a service that is already free. Then found out that the speed that I was offered was not being delivered. So paying for services not rendered and for a free service. When I asked for a refund, customer service said they cannot do that because the service was connected and shown in good status. I have had Time Warner Service before, and from over 15 years never had such problems. COMCAST REALLY, REALLY SUCKS. Even speaking with customer service, they have no phone etiquette, or sense of value to the customers.\r\n\r\nI expressed to the rep that I was already kind of burnt with; first the delay of 3 or 4 days connection after a change in the connection, second the poor quality of service, and plus being charged for services not rendered, as well as for a free service. Third and last when I expressed that I wanted the service that was offered to me in the beginning for that price, this customer service rep said that was no longer available (first offer was internet service 25mps for $29.99 monthly. After the change with TV was to be $39.99. then for changing the service to just Internet they would charge $64.99, where I had been with the company less than 30 days). Way to go Comcast. Losing customers in less than first billing cycle is over. Just because this website requires a star rating I had to give one, but I would take 5 stars if the option was available. COMCAST REALLY PROVED THEY SUCK. I am sure Verizon too.", "I have spent 3 weeks' time, countless hours on the phone to resolve my poor internet connection. Every time, I get a different explanation. I set up 2 appointments for visit to my home by a technician and took time off of work and no one showed up to my home. I was told it is possible my modem so I bought new modem and router and have the same issue. All I get from customer service is \"we can set up another appointment for you\". It's ** service by ** American companies.", "Okay so I pay for 100MBPS, No cheap B.S. But, going to check out speed reviews. I am currently getting 5-10mbps, just amazing, how sad that we are forced into these scam companies.", "I had to speak to 4 reps before finally having service installed at my home due to some sort of address issue (about 2 months of being told I would be called back when the issue was resolved - 3 reps, no call backs). I was finally happy/optimistic with the last rep (who actually called me back) until I found out a few weeks later he misrepresented (or blatantly lied) about the package he sold me - higher prices/lower speeds/no contracts/no service plan. Having my account straightened a few weeks after installation took 2 hours and 15 minutes - one phone call/one rep and not ending with the services or plans I was sold.\r\n\r\nI gave 2 stars because the last contact I had via chat with tech support (yesterday) was satisfactory, so I will try to remain hopeful that the worst is behind me but at this point, I can't stand Comcast/Xfinity. The reason for the tech call in the first place is still an issue with me. I wish Century Link could provide more than 6 mbps, though the 25 mbps with Comcast isn't much better - I was sold 200 mbps and misquoted about $70/month. Century Link treated me very well for 12 years.", "I used to love Comcast. Until all these constant updates. My internet and cable crash a lot at night, and sometimes during the day, some channels don't even work and on demand sometimes don't play either. I wish they will do something about it. Because just a few mins ago, the internet have crashed for about 20 mins for no reason. I'm tired of it and thinking about switching to Wow or something. Please do not get Xfinity.", "I have had Xfinity for about 6 months and it started out nice. Good amount of data for an ok price, I was a satisfied customer. Then about a month ago I started to notice my service drop more and more. I had to constantly restart the modem. I finally decided to call. Service center was methodical but the people were willing enough. I had a technician come over work on it a few hours did his routine and then asked me to connect. My internet did not work. He was so confident - he didn't even check to see if anything would connect. He was ready to leave. He then swapped out modems. Got the internet to connect and left. \r\n\r\nWeek goes by my internet is worse. This modem won't connect to anything and never turns on. I call rinse and repeat. They send a technician out, he looks at it thinks everything is fine. Gets the internet to turn on for enough time to sprint out the door. Finally I'm fed up, call a third time and tell THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE. They send a technician out, he's also clueless about why this is happening thinks maybe a 3rd modem will work. He swaps it out again gets it working and then leaves. Not two hours later it won't put out wifi. \r\n\r\nI FINALLY call and tell them this is ridiculous and I'm ready to quit my service. The operator had the audacity to argue with me. They I was in a \"contract\" and would have to pay a cancellation fee (like it was my fault for wanting to leave while I was NOT receiving a service I was paying for). I quickly tell them to put a supervisor on the phone. The supervisor didn't even answer the phone. \r\n\r\nAfter having to argue with the operator, the manager didn't even take a second look. They waived the fee (like they should have offered in the first place since they couldn't give me actual service). I was patient as could be went through weeks of calling and having clueless technicians come out, hours being on the phone with people who didn't even know what was going on. In summary Xfinity does not remotely care about its customers. You could be having the most absolute worst experience but as long as you're paying them. They wouldn't even give you a second look if you didn't lose your temper with the operator. If you have the internet and know how to restart a modem, congratulations. You have the education of a Comcast technician. Simply the worst experience I have personally ever had in any service, ever, period. I personally cannot wait for Google fiber to put them out of business. Justice served if you ask me.", "Had Comcast. Overall the terrible experience everyone else is describing but there was no other provider in my area at the time, so we just dealt with it. Ultimately moved out of my apartment to an area that was serviced by other providers, so I called to cancel my account. Took forever, but finally get through, and take my hardware back to the store. KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. Had to deal with a debt collector for 9 months claiming I owed money for not returning the hardware. Luckily I had physical proof. I honestly would have just paid the $60 or whatever it was if I wasn't sure they'd just keep calling. Would deny liability, it would get kicked to a different debt collection agency, someone new would call me a few months later. \r\n\r\nFINALLY went away, but I will never use Comcast again. The best part is that when I'd call for customer service, they would \"accidentally\" disconnect my call. HINT: If you want to cancel services or complain, choose the option on the customer service menu for \"add more services.\" They'll connect you to an agent immediately and you can ultimately get them to connect you to the right department directly. They'll probably still disconnect you a few times though.", "I Have been a long time customer and only have Xfinity as my ISP for a while now. While I was in the local Walmart on November 4, 2016, there were customer representatives from Xfinity running promotions for and in the Salt Lake City area. Spoke with a representative and was able to get and signed a contract for Pro Blast at $50.00 a month with no contract or early termination fees. I received an email from Xfinity stating the changes that would be made to my account. It stated that not only would it be under contract for 24 months but there would be early termination fees. This is not what I had originally signed up for and it specifically states this on the contract that I signed. \r\n\r\nContacted Xfinity customer service and was told since they cannot see the contract over the phone that I would need to go to Xfinity store in person. Went to Xfinity store on November 8, 2016 and was told that it would be under contract and there was no way around it. Because of this I have cancelled the upgrade and went back to my original plan. It's plain and simple. When a contract is signed it should be honored for what is stated on it. Xfinity is dishonest and not trustworthy. Therefore I will be looking and changing my ISP as soon as possible to another company. Xfinity does not deserve a paycheck from me or anyone else that I know.", "Check your contract when you sign up for Comcast as their advertised offers do not match the contract they issue. I signed up for $49.99 150Mbps internet for 2 years, however my contract has $19.99 for 25Mbps internet for 2 years. They say there is an add on in place for $30 which boost it to Blast! Pro, however this isn't part of the contract, which means that Comcast can increase the price whenever they want within the 2 years. This means I haven't received the advertised rate. Comcast has so far refused to issue corrected contract, or issue in writing that the $30 will remain at that price for 2 years. I just have to trust them. So watch out, Comcast is doing the usual illegal practices, I'm guessing to catch people out and hope they don't notice and end up paying more than they should.", "I've recently signed up with Comcast 7 days ago. I \"thought\" I was getting a good deal, maybe because I was anxious for having internet, or I didn't look for another companies. So far so good. I went to the Comcast Store and signed up for the service. They gave me the modem, router and all that stuff. Too easy to be real. Got home and I plugged in all the devices and made sure everything was ok. (I'm an IT professional so I really checked to see if I did good.) So far so good, called Comcast to send me the signal (the previous tenant at my apartment had Comcast before), so it was going to be everything on a snap.\r\n\r\nFirst call 48 minutes on the line. Nobody found out what was wrong with my stuff. 3 different persons. One did the generic procedures, it didn't work. They transferred me to the \"technical department\" which is not technical at all. The lady told me to figure it out by myself. -- What? Finally after all that rudeness I asked if I could speak with somebody else. I have a life to live and I don't want to stress myself because of an ISP provider. 3rd representative. Scheduled me a technician for $65 dollars. Like ok. So it's part of the package. You pay some amount of dollars to start the service plus the technician fee (which is funny that somebody had the same service before). Ripped me off.\r\n\r\nScheduled me for today January, 9th. 8-10 time frame. Now it's 10:12 and nobody showed up. I called at 8:40 to see if somebody was on the way. I work 40 hours a week, so I had to be there. The lady said that if I'm not home they can't do service (which is obvious) and said that they will contact the dispatch center to see what's up with the technician. After long wait finally said that they would be 15 minutes at my house. Sweet. After all that stress finally I'll get something fair. 10:14 now. The technician called 30 minutes ago saying that was going to be here 15 minutes ago. Called him to check on him. He said more 10 minutes. I don't know what I do to be honest. Or I send a How to be reliable for dummies book to their CEO or I apply to work there, because to be honest this service is getting closing to the end of my contract with them. (If they allow, you know that closing services fees.)", "I hate Comcast. The call center and the chat are useless. I have never had so many outages in my life than what I do with them. Also, they charged me twice for a billing cycle for two different amounts and when I'm trying to see the bill details, it won't let me open anything because I don't have a voice security pin - something I've never even heard of. So annoyed and frustrated with them. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.", "I have transferred service from Comcast to Verizon and back again several times throughout the years... only this time Comcast refused to cancel my internet and 1 of my 5 lines. They continued to charge me for months even after I contacted them. In the end, they claimed I didn't fill out the proper paperwork to cancel and that it must have been a Verizon error in regards to the un-cancelled line. When I requested to see the contract showing specific cancellation requirements I was refused. They did eventually fess up to the fact that the last line issue was a paperwork issue on their end and that I would see an adjusted bill for that - which still has not happened. I've been making low payments each month and now they are seeking a judgment against me. I will never again... under any circumstance do business with this scam of a company.", "So, for starters, my internet was so slow today and the day after and after and after it's almost everyday, it took 3 and a half hours to download something that was 160 MB! That is way less than a GB and that is BS. And also, I was having trouble with my cable, (almost everyday) and I was on the phone for a literal 6 HOURS and I am not exaggerating either, cause I always look at the clock when I go on the phone with someone and end the call. So it was 10:00 in the morning and we ended the call at 4:25 P.M so it was 6 hours and 25 minutes. Anyways, they charged me 30.00 DOLLARS FOR A PROBLEM THAT THEY ARE HAVING, and get this, they didn't even send a technician to my house. They basically just said ** it and \"you deal with the problem.\" And usually they almost ALWAYS send a technician out and they don't even fix the problem. It will work for like a week then we will have bad service again. COMCAST SUCKS!", "I moved 1 mile from old home with Xfinity service to new home hoping to create Xfinity service. I called 1 month in advance and was give an install date for internet, phone and tv. I contracted with a company to install my TV's and sound system and we both waited patiently on Xfinity's 1st promised install date for 4 hours and Xfinity technicians never showed up for the install. I call 4 times for feedback and continued to get customer service response that they are not able to communicate with install and all they can do is escalate. I was given a 2nd install date again no tech showed up then a 3rd date and not tech showed up. At this point my 4 kids have gone 3 weeks at our new home without internet to complete school assignments. At one point prior to my 4th install date, I had a customer service rep. tell me that she did not want to hear any of my story so keep it to myself.\r\n\r\nPrior to my 4th install date they canceled it again because of early termination fee. How the hell can you have this fee when you are transferring service one mile away. Finally one month after my original install date my service was turned on. To pour acid on the wound today I called to ask why I am not receiving a bill via the internet as I set up and they proceeded to read off another person's email in which Xfinity is sending my bill and requiring me to pay the late fees and reactivation fees now.\r\n\r\nI do not know why Xfinity treats human beings so poorly. My written description cannot even touch the emotion stress that they put on me and my family. We were without internet for school and our emergency land line for a month because Xfinity is so disorganized. To make matters worse, they do not care at all and have customer service reps that talk to you like you are beneath them. I have run 3 businesses for the past 25 years and would be out of business in less than a year if I ran my business like Xfinity. I would run to DirecTV and avoid Xfinity at all cost.", "Had internet installation set up for Oct. 12 from 5 pm-7 pm. Two guys not wearing any Comcast uniform showed up on Oct. 12 to \"set up\" the Internet and they did not do so. Their excuse was that there was no internet signal and they told me to contact Comcast to send a line technician to check for a signal. I called Comcast soon after they left and the line technician arrived within an hour. The line technician had a Comcast uniform and he was very nice.\r\n\r\nThe line tech checked for a signal and was confused when I told him what the 2 other guys said. The line tech there was more than enough signal to complete the set up of the Internet. Hearing this made me upset because we were charged $50 to have the internet installed and now we had to wait for another scheduled installation which thankfully happened on Oct. 13. I called Comcast soon after the line tech left and I requested the installation fee be waived and the operator said they could not waive the entire $50, but that she would discount $25 for the trouble. I HAVE YET TO SEE THIS DISCOUNT ON A BILL.\r\n\r\nWhat is upsetting is that our services were not installed until technically 10/13/16, but our first bill was due on 11/10/16. Then for the month of December, our bill was due on 12/7/16. The new January bill arrived a few days ago and the bill is due on 01/6/17. So, Comcast is billing me for a full month's worth of services that I am not receiving! What's next, February's bill will be cut short another day and be due 02/5/17? I want this resolved please and at least my $25 discount plus a prorated amount for the days I am being cut short of service.", "In June 2016 I got basic internet with Comcast, 25 Mbps for $39.99, I had no problems. In October of 2016 per their website if you had questions or interest issues you could call or use their online chat. I was at work so opted to use online chat. My concern was about changing my internet password. I was assisted by a rep named Deepkanshu (I saved our correspondence via IM to my email). He began trying to sell me to their basic cable/internet package- for $59.99. I was not interested in cable by any means BUT I agreed for 2 very specific reasons. \r\n\r\n1. The representative repeatedly assured me there is a 30 day money back guarantee. And in 30 days ALL I had to do was send the equipment back and they would take the cable portion off my account and put me back on my promo of $39.99. 2. I SPECIFICALLY asked him \"will I lose my promo of $39.99 if I don't want it (the cable internet bundle)?\" He explicitly said no. I said that sounded good and I would try. He sent me a service agreement which I DID NOT sign because my work computer crashed. I thought well I didn't sign the agreement so I'm assuming they won't send the setup equipment which is better for me. \r\n\r\nA couple days later I decided to confirm, again via IM I spoke to a rep named Rashim. Rashim said it was too late and the equipment was set to go out Oct 26. I reiterated okay fine but if I don't like it will I get my $39.99 deal back? He stated YES. He also repeated what Deepkanshu said about the only thing I needed to do was send the equipment back. Great, so from my understanding I have 30 days to try cable. If I don't like it I get my internet deal back and won't have to pay for cable after I send everything back. On Nov 24th I sent the package back. On Nov 28th I receive an email stating my equipment was received and in up to 2 weeks it would be removed from my account. Great. 3 weeks later it's still on my account. \r\n\r\nI decided to call. I spoke to a woman and unfortunately I did not get her name, but she said it was my fault and it would remain on my account until I CALLED to cancel (Deepkanshu and Rashim DID NOT mention I needed to call, their explicit instructions were send the equipment back and cable will be removed from your account). She then proceeds to tell me there is no money back guarantee (the 2 reps before her said there was). At this point I'm upset and I tell her take the cable off of my account and she says \"okay, but your new internet will be $59.99.\" $59.99 for internet are you joking?! She says \"well there's a deal for $49.99\" and I said \"no I want my $39.99 deal back that I was repeatedly assured I would get back.\" She then said \"well you'd have to go into a store and maybe they could help you but probably not\". \r\n\r\nI'm frustrated and agree to the $49.99 internet deal. She then says \"sorry I can't give you anything else because online and phone deals are different.\" WHY IS THERE DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND DEALS IF YOU ARE THE SAME EXACT COMPANY. So I'm paying for cable that I did not have for a whole month. I was lied to about the money back guarantee AND returning to my old deal which were the PRIMARY reasons I even agreed to try the package in the first place. In addition to that I NEVER signed the service agreement so for all your company knows, it was fraud. I saved all of my correspondence emails and IMs. Anything to get you into a package and still have you paying for it.", "I'm so over Comcast! The worst internet provider.

I don't watch cable because it's mostly just crap that they think is entertaining and because I am tired of all of the commercials; most specifically all of the drug commercials that are constantly playing.

The new internet package had a higher speed and various TV channels to go with it all for the same price I was paying for my existing package. I agreed to get the new package. When my first bill came in they charged me more than they said they would and the reason is that I was being billed for a different package than agreed upon.

On the other side of the coin, when I received the new modem I spent an hour of my time and an hour of Comcast customer service time only to be told the modem was faulty and that I could return it to one of their return centers. What? I have a service contract also so I insisted they bring a new one and install it themselves. Of course they want to schedule an appointment in the middle of the afternoon which I could not do so a week and a half later they install a new modem/WiFi unit but left me without the use of my printers which were attached to the modem via ethernet. \r\n\r\nThe next morning I called and wasted another hour and a half only to be left with no solution. Now I have to wait until they can fit me in on a Saturday. I was told yesterday morning a supervisor would escalate the return service call and that they would call me back in 15 minutes or so. Also they told me it was likely the printer's manufacturer's issues and I needed to call them. Funny they both worked with the other modem/WiFi. They have yet to call me back with an \"escalated service call\" so I sit here without the use of my printers with no solution except for me to engage the services of an IT expert at my expense. Buyer beware... Good luck with your problem resolutions.", "Comcast/Xfinity blew up everyone's email nationwide - or a large percentage. They supposedly have \"improved\" it. I guess if you call crashing many people's email, not fixing it, not have the bcc feature, and then having to deal w/ the idiocy of the moronic tech support and still not have good functioning email you would consider it an upgrade, if you were drunk or stupid. But I consider it a fiasco and Keystone Cops. I am sorry for that insult. I will apologize... Dear Keystone Cops, I am sorry for comparing you to Comcast incompetent people. \r\n\r\nSo I filed a ticket 2 weeks ago to have a higher level tech call me as - as usual, the front line reps know nothing and have not been trained and just get thrown on the phones. So 2 weeks go by and I get a call from Jenna - but I was out so we make an appointment for her to call me back at 11 am. It's now 2 pm and she has not called.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile 1 hour ago I call and get **. She does not care that ** never called me, makes no effort to apologize. She keeps talking over me and does not answer any of my questions but just gives the runaround for 20 minutes and then blames it on me though she was the one not answering questions and being totally incompetent. After 20 minutes she finally decides to read the computer notes instead of doing it while we were talking as most competent people do. She then tells me that she can't help me!!! That it requires a higher level tech though she had all of the notes from the start! Twenty minutes wasted. She then tells me she will send notice to the level 3 tech and they will call... in 72 hours!!!\r\n\r\nSo I am saying, \"Well I would assume I would get a call back right away. Can't you contact someone\" - and she stonewalls me for another 10 minutes saying it's not possible. I finally get her to put manager ** on the phone and only after begging and pleading does he mention that he has a way of sending a special notification. So instead of just telling me when he came on the line he made me plead for 10 minutes. So he institutes the special message - for lack of a better term and tells me... it will be, \"only\" 48 hours. He could have cared less that Jenna never called me even though it was now 3 hours later. Instead of being competent manager and saying, \"Wow - she didn't call you? I'll notify her manager. We don't consider that acceptable.\" It WAS perfectly acceptable and fine that his reps do not call back. So I am still without any decent email.", "Tonight, Saturday December 10th at around 9:40 pm I called because I wanted to know how to put a password on my wifi network. I started a chat with a gentleman by the name of Thomas and he informed that he could not help and I needed to go through their High Speed department. I waited for 10-12 mins since I was 19 on the line. I finally got to speak with a gentleman whose name escaped me now.\r\n\r\nThe chat started out with him wanting to verify everything. Keep in mind, I have gone through this with the other agent. I understand so I went along. He asked for my full address which I provided. The phone number in the account, the social security, the account number, the username and he wanted to speak to my wife to confirm. Now, keep in mind that I provided all these information. It's now 10:24 pm and I still have not gotten to why I called 9:40 pm. He woke my wife and she is now completely unhappy and the kickoff, he wanted to know after all that, what email in the account.\r\n\r\nI am sorry but I am done! This is nothing more than someone with a lot of time who claims that they are doing customer service, doing the exact opposite of customer service. My bank do not ask that many questions. Please, make a policy that make sense. I no longer want to do business with this company and will be looking for a different provider. I know I am only one customer but I would rather pay $188/month to someone that make business sense.", "Xfinity is by far the worst company. Ever. I'm not saying this because I've had one bad experience with this laughable company. I say this because you pay high amounts and don't get what you agreed upon. I agreed to pay them $39.99 a month for 25 mbps. I frequently am getting.60 mbps. In fact I think the only time that I've ever had the correct internet speed was the day I was set up. Shortly thereafter it dropped to this amount. Of course the reps over the phone are trained to play the blame game, which I know as a fact the issue has nothing to do with my equipment.\r\n\r\nI'm a networking expert and it's apparent that the company is dishonest and doesn't care about anything but taking your money. They take advantage of those that don't have any other option, but to be set up with this company. This is a perfect example of corruption. Xfinity has a goal to monopolize the business, then they can continue \"providing\" laughable service to people, and charge unethical amounts.\r\n\r\nGo with a different company that actually cares about the people it's providing the service to. There is a reason this company always has a 1 star rating, it's because the service SUCKS. Anything higher than a 1 star is a fake review, keep that in mind. If I had the money I would sue this company for as much as I could. I wish they would go out of business and the CEO would be put in prison for lying to the public over and over.", "In May 2016 I paid my account and four later it charged to my checking account the same amount without my authorization. My bank considered its second charge criminal activity and did not pay Comcast the second charge it made to the checking account. Its billing offices never credited my account the payment I made even after I sent in proof of my payment. It submitted my account to a credit collection agency. I sent it proof of my payment. Comcast is telling me 8 months later that I never paid my account. I looked online. I am contacting the BBB Greater Maryland and other authorities to see what negative/punitive actions I can take against Comcast. I have searched online and Comcast is not BBB accredited. It is Best & Better ** accredited. That's what it is.", "I'm sure most people are only motivated to write reviews when they are unhappy. I am loving Xfinity, however over the years I have had the old Comcast, then Verizon Fios, then RCN, and now Comcast Xfinity. Of all the services, Xfinity is the best. It has been very reliable, has a great user interface, wonderful voice enabled remote, dependable and very useful iPhone apps, and ability to watch shows on my computer, smartphone and tablet both at home and away from home. There is really nothing I don't like about my experience with them. It has been very reliable, so I cannot personally comment on service. Neighbors who have needed service, reportedly get very prompt responses by technicians who try their best to get the job done the first time. So, in my town, Xfinity is a terrific choice.", "Last year I switched from AT&T to Comcast because our server needed higher speed. We switched to Comcast. For one year we have had issues. Our phone service would shut down 4-6 days a week almost every month. We would call into Comcast to see what is going on, we would enter our phone number and a recording would come on saying \"we are aware of an outage in your area, we are working to fix the issues, press one to speak to a representative.\" You press one and it would just hang up. Over, and over and over again this would happen.\r\n\r\nOur customers couldn't reach us, our stores couldn't receive faxes and our sales people were unable to contact customers. Our online advertising was worthless and our print advertising was too. Our customers couldn't reach us, Comcast wouldn't speak to us, each time we would file a complaint they would dismiss us saying it will be up \"soon.\" Now we are fighting to get our number switched over from Comcast to AT&T. Comcast will not allow AT&T to switch our number, each time we call in they give us another reason for not releasing our number. Today 1/20/2017 it is now going on 3 weeks since we have tried to disconnect from Comcast. Today when we called in Comcast says they will not release our number due to a past due balance. They are also saying we owe them $4500 on the rest of our contacted balance. Which is against the federal trade laws.\r\n\r\nComcast is a worthless phone provider. They cannot contractually hold up on their end of the contract to provide service. They service and their customer service is the worst in the industry. I am a small business and they are hurting my business. I want an investigation into Comcast! They cannot continue strong arming small businesses and not providing service as agreed upon. Now while searching to upload the docusign documents in my email... for disconnect? They have vanished from my sent email box. The service is crappy, the customer service is horrible, and it is hurting our business!", "I've had service(?) from this company since 7/2015. They have fouled up my billing on more than one occasion, been untruthful, have awful service, don't invest in utilizing USA phone support (anti-American) and now I truly believe they are throttling down my WiFi so I give them even more money on a monthly basis to get a \"faster internet connection\". Some days WiFi drops out completely. You call them and you are lucky if you can get away from their initial voice recognition system which is horrendous in and of itself. If you are lucky, you hear \"service is out in your area...we are working on it\". Finally, I've had to leave work on 3 occasions to be present for a technician to come in to fix the system. I AM HOPING THAT THEIR MONOPOLY IS NOT EXTENEDED BY THE FCC WHEN SOME ISP WANTS TO BUY THEM OR VICE VERSA. They are the worst company I've ever had dealings with.", "I purchased internet for a second home. I was debating whether or not to use Comcast because my service experience with them was sub-par at my main home. I vetted with two separate Comcast Agents on whether or not they could combine the internet in the second home onto my current billing so that it'd just be one bill. Both explicitly said yes, very simple. Upon purchase and setup, I found out this was a lie (even had to google it) and they cannot put it on one bill. This was further worse because they created a username/e-mail without my permission which I had to try setup taking multiple hours. Now I have to pay two separate bills but feel like they lied to me to get more business.", "Ripoff -- The less you have with them, the more they charge. Mr. ** you have a great deal, $99.00 package. Bull, I pay $140.00 with garbage fees and taxes, oh and equipment, so how can they say $99.00? They are so corrupt. It's not funny.", "Good customer service and technician support. Very rare outages and if there are any, then it is usually back up within a small amount of time. Installing it is very easy to do yourself. If you need a technician to do it, they are very knowledgeable and will not only do it for you but show you the steps. Customer service is very polite and easy to contact. They are usually very quick to get issues resolved. If not, they will escalate it to higher where it can be resolved. Very consistent speed and on par with most of the other services out there. Easy to do practically any task on the web that you need and then some.", "My Internet connection randomly disconnects. I can usually reconnect within less than a minute but it's frustrating sometimes. This happens more than with other providers I have used but it's not enough of a pain for me to take the time and get a different provider. We had a problem, and we were on hold with customer service for several hours. I had to plug in my phone to the charger so that it wouldn't die while waiting. Customer service was very difficult to communicate with. Customer service is the single worst thing about this provider. When convenient, I will probably choose a different provider due to this. This is the fastest Internet connection I have ever had. It's great. However the random disconnections cause it to seem slow sometimes.", "Many Comcast products are available for self-installation, if you want to do that. But my condo was pre-wired for cable, so installation was not an issue. Comcast is a little pricey, but it is very stable and reliable. It is one of the fastest providers in my area, and is influencing where I may relocate, to stay in its service area. Internet is always available with quality high speed. It consistently performs very well on any speed tests. It is very stable for all my needs and it has definitely spoiled me. I also very rarely have any issues, so I don't need to deal with customer service very often. When I have, I have received prompt resolution to my issues. All in all, I'm satisfied.", "The installation process was fairly easy. I only had to ask the technician a few questions over the phone, otherwise they were able to easily walk me through it. Comcast is a decent provider. The service rarely goes down and when it does they are quick to fix it. Customer service are always willing to listen to my issues and promptly resolve them. If they cannot immediately resolve the issue they come up with alternative solutions. Also, the speed is pretty average and I use 15mbps currently. They do offer faster speeds than that and the service is slightly better with the higher speeds.", "TV service and internet speed is great and always work. I use the internet on four different devices and they all work good. I like Comcast very much. Everyone should use it because it is so awesome. The installation was very easy and customer service is good. Whenever you call they pick and not too long wait. They listen to all your problems and provide best feedback. I highly recommend Comcast.", "Comcast Internet is very reliable and I never had any issue with losing signal. The speed always seemed to fit my needs and it's the fastest I ever had. Like most companies they gave a window of time that the installers would show up in. They did make it in that time frame and they were pretty fast and efficient with their installation. Their reps are always available and they help with any needs and questions that I ever had about charges, new feature or savings I might be able to take advantage of.", "The service was unstable and I was not happy at all. For the price we were paying I wouldn't expect so many issues. I wouldn't rely on Comcast to work from home. The technician was on the phone arguing the whole time he was here. He was at least working while he was on the phone. By the end of conversation he quit. He finished my installation but still very unprofessional. Sometimes wait time with Customer Service was quite long. Once you get through, the representatives seemed to be helpful most of the time. The response most of the time was to unplug our modem for a few seconds. The speed was sufficient and the only problem was the unreliability. Web surfing was pleasant and downloading was quick when it was working properly.", "When I move into a new house there is already places for the system to be installed. Only thing the technician needed to do was to hook up my Internet modem for me. Very fast high speeds and internet pages load very fast. They also have great, fast and reliable customer service. Always nice, polite and helpful while at the store and over the phone. If I ever have any issues they promptly send out a technician to fix them.", "Internet reliability is great. I don't run into any problems with the speed and I use several devices. Though I still think this internet service is overpriced, I am overall happy with the internet service itself. I am also satisfied with the installation because I had to install it myself. If you do not install it yourself, you have to pay $50 for a tech to come out. However, the people that they hire for customer service needs to be changed because it is horrible. I hate the customer service reps for them. You can tell that they have a high turnover rate because everyone is incompetent. Have had several issues with the company and I am looking to change providers.", "We had a guy come out and install our service. He explained everything, made sure all of our devices were set up, and was very straightforward and to the point. I am happy with the speed of things. We download movies and games, I do surveys, we watch Netflix, and we use Spotify. The service is pretty reliable and we usually do not have problems with it going out. If we have a problem we get in touch with customer service and they are pretty good. I usually do chat online since it seems to be quicker. Sometimes calling can be a while. Then they help me or find someone who can. All in all, great internet and customer service.", "They're wonderful and the person showing up to install was on time, very polite and wore his booties. He took the time to answer any questions I had as well as setting up all my TV remotes to work on the TVs. And anytime I had to call the person who helped me was always polite and helpful. I have never reached someone who was rude or was unable to assist me. Also, the service I got was super fast, easy to use and very reliable. I now have another company and it's horrible. I wish I was in an area with Xfinity. I miss the service they provide. They have the fastest internet available and people who can choose Xfinity are so incredibly lucky and many don't even know it. Try being somewhere that has only one company and for it to be an older slower style of internet.", "Internet speed is slow and unreliable and isn't always the best at times. Also needs to be reset a couple of times before it works again. Definitely could use improvements with better packaging. Cable is fine but internet not so much. When we set it up on our own, we didn't get it at first but received help over the phone and it went smoothly and was able to complete quickly. Overall customer service and their local office has been great and helpful whenever I need assistance.", "We have very rarely ever had any interruption in service, and the times that we have it was only for a brief period of time. Picture quality has always been good and our internet speed is fast and consistent. We have never had any problem with the speed of our internet or streaming services. I would recommend Xfinity to anyone in the market for a new provider. In the few instances that we have had to use customer service, they were able to solve our issues and work out any problems we were having in a timely and professional manner. Also, the technician who installed the system was on time and was very knowledgeable in the installation process. They were also able to answer any questions that we had and address any concerns very well.", "I am beyond frustrated with Comcast and Xfinity. Each time I have to address an issue which all has to do with bad internet connection and very slow internet, it takes most of my morning or most of my evening in trying to solve my problems, and if I am lucky, I won't have to extend it to more than one day. We, as consumers sacrifice our time, trading dealing with these issues for others that could help us earn our money or take care of important tasks in our lives. Our time as consumers have less than \"0\" value to Comcast, while the game they play means tons of money for them. These issues, however never seem to go away.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that if we as taxpayers funded the invention of the internet, we cannot have it if not for free, at a reasonable price and a reliable service? Instead we are providing for big profits to Comcast for products that they invented to make more money, but for the consumer means absolutely nothing. The middle class areas get the internet at the highest prices with a horrible connection; and the offers are only available in a few areas. How can that be legal? The internet should belong to the government and make money only to pay for social needs not to fatten the pockets of CEOs.", "I thought Nothing could be worse than Time Warner. I was seriously wrong. Service cuts out hourly, or if it does not cut out altogether it slows way down. I am paying for 10mbps. Right. I think it may have hit that ONCE. I do speed tests regularly and on a good day it may hit 5 mbps. On an average day less than two with regular cut-outs. Of course, when they have a monopoly there is no incentive to provide good service.", "For a month my internet/wifi has been sketchy. Cannot say I've had Internet for 2 hours in a row. Then my TV started freezing, tiling, no sound or sound garbled. For 5 days I called, talked to about 20 different people. Each experience worse than the last. Each person said they would \"open a repair ticket\" for someone to come out. Each time, the ticket was closed. Reason? Wrong type of ticket, internal ticket, must do ticket, etc. These were some of the reasons. I had to drive 10 miles to pick UP MY NEW EQUIPMENT. AFTER INSTALLATION, STILL DID NOT WORK. To date, five days after first call. STILL NO TECHNICIAN. Been promised from about 5 different supervisors \"someone would be there tomorrow.\" Tomorrow never comes. Please, bypass this business. You will Pay out the butt for this service and never get it.\r\n\r\nCustomer service is rude, and non existent. You will pay for your technical support visit when they tell you you won't be charged. They never follow thru and the service is terrible. Your Internet and wifi will never work, the picture is lousy and no one will help you. Oh yeah, when I signed up they tell you you are getting a VISA gift card, 3 years later, still haven't received it. When you call about that, whoever you talk to gives you a different reason with a call back coming explanation, never happens. Isn't that against the law??? Every call for every problem is, \"we'll have someone get back to you,\" it NEVER HAPPENS. We should open a class action suit against these people. This is robbery and theft by deception. You are asking for an order #? I have 5, which one do you want??? I have ALL NAMES AND EMPLOYEES NUMBERS IF YOU WANT THEM. PLEASE, DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THIS BUSINESS.", "For the last 3 months my Xfinity internet upload speed has been ranging from 8 mbps to less than 200 kbps during various times during the day. I have had my home and equipment diagnosed and all is good. One tech told me that there is a leak and that the cable needs to be replaced. I have not had the cable replaced. I have explained Xfinity about the upload speed is the only one that is affecting my internet and that it does not happens all of the time. The upload speed decrease happens any hour of the day and it last for a few hours at a time. Xfinity tech support cant help me at all. I have replaced the modem, cable connectors and have only one coax cable connection from the wall to the modem. I don't have any other connections. I only have internet service from Xfinity. I will drop the internet service due to upload speed drop during the day, not being able to make video calls, voice calls, upload photos or send emails with attachments.", "Xfinity Comcast has been the worst decision of my life! 3 router boxes later and my internet still won't work! \"Our new box has two networks you can use.\" Can I just get ONE that WORKS PROPERLY?!?!\" What's the point of two when the both can't stay connected? Why do I pay for Hulu or Netflix when I have to sign back in at least 10 times for a 30 min TV show? My 30-minute tv show just turned into an hour. \"Then connect your Xbox to the router\" they tell me. If that's the case, \"Why am I paying for WIRELESS?!\" I would highly recommend any other cable company. Xfinity is absolutely terrible.", "FYI, Sometime before the 2016 Christmas holidays I contacted Comcast/Xfinity about my internet service. Well what it comes down to is the tech support agent recommended a technician come out to address the issue after explaining to him the problem. He sternly said that this is no charge to me, I had him to reassure me of this again cause I couldn't believe there wasn't a charge. He said absolutely no charge. Only to find out a couple weeks later my bill was higher than usual and in it under other charges and credit; a $50 fee + taxes was included. \r\n\r\nI called customer service only to be told after some checking there wasn't anything in the notes of the agent who took my call about no service fee. So beware. If there's a next time, while cus/ser is on the line, I will ask them to email any promises they make over to me. By the way the representative I spoke with on the second call appeared to be extremely unhappy with my issue and did offer to cut the fee in half. I'm just very dissatisfied in a representative saying something is of \"no charge\" and then there is a charge because truly I didn't want to pay for anyone to come out.", "Comcast XFINITY turned to be nightmare for me. It is been 7 month and still don't have proper internet connection at home. The worst internet I ever had. Completely dissatisfied. I am tired of calling customer service almost every day.", "I had problems with Xfinity internet since the week I got it. Instantly having problems with no connection. I spent in excess of 20 HOURS a month in chat and/or on the phone trying to get my net back online. I was told a tech would come out on thanksgiving so I sat home waiting and he never showed. Then after they sent the second tech my net was back off in less than 2 days. I was repeatedly told a supervisor would have it escalated to be fixed and that my bill would be adjusted. After 5 months still not fixed and they wanted to fight me over the adjustment they promised to me twice! So basically I'm paying for a service that doesn't, and hasn't, worked since I got it and they don't have the experience to know how to fix it.", "Comcast fees are outrageously high. I mean like a $100 package is billed at $140. Certainly my state taxes aren't 14%. Also, internet gets real slow... Ever since I switch to AT&T my bill is only $90 and the internet is always dependably fast. Note, Comcast has two state class action lawsuits against them for billing errors! Missouri and Washington. Soon all 50 I hope. \r\n\r\nCustomer service is very poor! Customer service managers aren't any better. Contact their higher and higher management... Still no good. I've cancelled service, disagreed about my billing. They put bill on my credit report. My further complaints went their way! So, I protested around major cities, with my Billboard on front and back. Nearly all companies' managements help their customers. Not this company! I'm happy with AT&T! Financially relieve. And total dependable internet makes me wonder why I chose Comcast in the first place??? There's better businesses than this one. Ethical, helpful, and dependable.", "Step by step instructions and caller support were of course instrumental in the installation of our Internet. We were able to set it up ourselves, we're not so much with the tech savvy, either. Customer service would stay on the phone with us every time we called until whatever problem we had at the time was solved. That I did like. When I used the service it was fast enough for me. Always needed update though. I cannot even use the computer that used this service anymore as I cannot figure out all the update stuff but overall I was satisfied at the time. I would imagine the current version is much faster and easier to use.", "Installation was very fast and as expected. Installer gave few instructions on setup but was 1/2 hour late and didn't call. Cleanup of the site was good, though. The one time I had a problem, I called and waited for nearly a half hour. The tech was not able to solve the problem and was talking down to me. But for the price, the top speed is great! This is really their main strength. Speed sometimes lesser than desired due to addition overall traffic on their system, but still faster than the competition. There is the occasional outage which is frustrating but for the most part, service is reliable.", "I have been a customer for several years and have only experience brief outages and did receive a two dollar credit on my monthly bill for a four day outage. The cable installation was poor at best. Remote was not set up. Had to make numerous calls about the second room problem. Was told I would receive a month credit that never happened. Tried to cancel service. Got disconnected twice then was talked into a two year price lock that after a year was rate increased and to this day has never been taken care of two auto withdrawals in one month. The speed is up to par. I have very little problems with downloads or any of the other items or projects I do online... This is probably the only aspect of Xfinity that I am happy with.", "The device is fast and pretty reliable, occasional spottiness for the signal if more than 2 people are streaming movies or playing online games. Streaming and game playing is very fast as long as only 2 people are doing it. Especially, when others are on the internet exchanging emails and or searching things. Then in our basement it looks like a spider web of cable. It makes it very confusing if we have a connection issue if another Comcast repair person comes to check the cable wires. Also, their customer service is very quick to send you to an automated system and it also seems like they are only reading a script and do not know exactly what they are doing. At one time about a year ago I had to call 4 times for someone on the other line to understand what I was telling them.", "I only have minor issues with the technicalities part of the service. Customer services are really that great and that depends on who you speak with.  I thought the installation was swift and very professional although I periodically noticed an attitude from the service worker. The worker was kind of rude and seemed as though he was being inconvenienced and wanted to go elsewhere. Also, I think that customer service hasn't been exemplary in all the services that hey provide. Not in luring call times; there are a number of issues customer service providers have when addressing certain issues. But the speed of the services is fine. It may sometimes run a little slower depending on what area you may be in. The larger factors usually include inclement weather conditions and forces of nature that are usually out of anyone's control. I am very happy with the abilities of my service provider.", "The signal range was very good (almost no dead spots), as well as the value of the service was very good considering the price compared to other companies. The service tech came when he said he would and not late like I have experienced with other companies. He was very friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the service he was installing, and helped with any questions we had. Honestly I have never had to call their Customer Service about anything. Our service never went out or experienced any problems but my aunt had to call and she had everything fixed quickly so based on that they are great. The speed of their internet service was honestly one of the best I've ever used. It blows the company I was using before switching out of the water. I never had a issue with slow internet even with 4 or more people connected at one time.", "The company was reliable. Anytime I had to call customer service they were able to help me fix whatever problems I was experiencing. They were fast, friendly and knowledgeable. I always got off the call knowing and feeling like I was offered their utmost attention. My technician arrived on time and was very friendly. Installation took about as long as it should and he even stayed to make sure I was knowledgeable about the product. The internet speed could be little faster, but for the most part it was okay. I was able to achieve what I was trying to and the speed was reliable when I needed it to be.", "I would recommend Xfinity for its convenience. The installation was fast and easy. The only downfall is when you get an upgrade you have to go to the office to pick it up instead of them coming to you with it. The customer service is decent, they do offer freebies and incentives when you are unhappy with the service. Workers are friendly and helpful. The speed of the Internet is pretty fast, although I have nothing to compare it to since I have never used any other service since dial-up. However, there is a bad signal, had to call to have it reset often. And it's hard to get in touch with an actual person, the automated service gives you the run around too much.", "The installer was prompt and had the equipment installed in a timely and professional manner. He took the time to explain all the hardware and got it up and running. The Internet is super fast. I never have trouble loading pages or downloading files or videos. I am very happy with the speed of the Internet from Xfinity. Sometimes the network is down, but not for long. The customer service is helpful when I have called with technical issues except for the long hold times. It is worth staying on the line because they always help fix the problems, but it can be a little frustrating.", "There are almost never any connection problems and when there are connection problems, the representatives online or over the phone are very helpful and patient and they are always able to solve the problem. Installation took about as much time as any other company but the people were very friendly and easy to work with. They made sure I understood everything I needed to and answered all my questions. Representatives explain things very thoroughly and are never rude. They make the experience easier and more enjoyable. Comcast is the fastest internet I have ever had. The internet reaches all throughout the house. Web pages and apps connect and load almost instantly. I am very impressed with the speed of my internet.", "I lose my connection a lot which is not good and I find this very annoying. I do not think the speed is fast enough to be useful to me while using the computer on the internet. They need to be much better, faster, and more reliable in their internet service. The installation experience was not a good thing at all. They did not come when they said they were going to come which I did not like one bit. They are not very good at customer service, too. They do not speak English at all and I could not make sense of what they were saying.", "Reliability was good. The speed was actually really good considering I was streaming and downloading and using the internet on multiple devices. The quality was good just not worth the price. The price is why I canceled. I got the self install kit and it was really easy to set up. I know some basics of technology but I am not an expert but I was able to set it up really quickly and did not have any problems. Customer service was horrible. They never told me about upcoming changes to my bill even when I asked. There was no consistency and each person I spoke with told me something different. There were a few nice associates but in general they were always rude and unprofessional.", "The installation crew always showed up in the time window they said they were coming. They installed everything reasonably quickly. They explained everything thoroughly and always asked if we had questions. The service was pretty consistent. I've never had any major problems with it. If there were any issues, they were usually just small issues that were easily resolved. The rare times that I called customer service, the people were courteous and the problem was resolved when it could be. It is the fastest internet experience I have ever had. Any other I have tried was noticeably slower. I would definitely recommend Comcast Internet to any friend or family member.", "My installation was very long. I could not understand why it took so long to hook up everything because I already had cable with the same provider and was shocked at the installation price. On the other hand, the customer service is very good. I had a problem a few weeks ago and customer service was very patient walking me through things. Customer service rep was very helpful and stayed with me on the phone until the problem was fixed. Highly satisfied. My server is reliable most of the time and the internet speed is very good. The only time I have issues with speed is during the late afternoon between 4 and 6 pm eastern standard time, it gets slow but most of the time my experience is very efficient and easy.", "Wireless internet service is quick regardless of how many users are accessing the Internet. Very reliable with very little down time and usually prompt customer service. Speed is very good regardless of how many users are accessing the service. Installation was on time within the agreed 2 hour window provided. Installer was knowledgeable, polite and efficient. Customer service has been decent enough but could be better from the standpoint of time waiting on hold to speak to someone.", "Comcast is a good company to enlist the help of. They provide good, quality service at an affordable price that is competitive with other companies similar to it. They have a fast installation service, with hardly any hassle, and the customer service is also very nice. IT is outstanding. They come in and do not waste your time. They are efficient at what they do and I like that. I would definitely recommend this company to another friend. The internet speed is alright for the service that they provide. However, it could be better, but I suppose that it's my location's fault...", "Slow, random service - When the internet works, it's great speed and service. And IF it is working, load times are instantaneous. But the reliability is HORRIBLE!!! The service rarely works when you need it the most, causing SLOW load times, and a LOT of \"time-outs\", or \"service unavailable/no connection\". By FAR the most unreliable service I've EVER used! Also, HORRIBLE installation service! Not only are they unprofessional, but they aren't timely... What do I mean by not timely? You'd think I'm complaining about 15, 20, 30 minutes, even an hour late, right? Nope! I'm talking NO SHOW not timely!!! Like, \"we'll be there by 3:30 pm,\" but they don't come AT ALL! Horrible... Just horrible.\r\n\r\nEven customer service is ridiculously bad... If you call customer service, and you don't get hung up on after the automated system, when they go to connect you to a live person, the live person is horrible! They aren't trained to do anything to help you, for one. For two, if you complain about how you're paying them for a service you aren't technically receiving, they don't care and won't do anything to help you. If you call and complain about the service workers/installers not showing up, AT ALL, they try blaming you somehow, like it's your fault they decided to skip your house that day... Not like they knocked and you didn't answer; they literally never drive down your street, or likely anywhere near your neighborhood.", "When we first received the services and when we moved, we were able to set our internet up ourselves and it was a very easy installation. Comcast is a very easy company and the customer service is very reliable. They answer my questions online or on the phone correctly and in a timely manner without any difficulties. Their staff are also always on time for their appointments if anything needs fixed or serviced. If there is an outage they usually fix it with a good amount of time. Also, my internet service speed is faster than actually what is expected for what I pay for. The speed is faster than Fios so I am happy with my services.", "Comcast Internet service is overall great service but somewhat expensive when bundled with cable. Internet speed is fairly good except for streaming Netflix or Youtube during peak usage times. It tends to time out at exactly the wrong times when I play online card tournaments. Internet reliability is only fair. Some disconnections can be attributed to old devices and improper placement of wi-fi access point. Others happen during peak hours when streaming videos or movies. Then, many times you can expect to get button hooked into extra services or extra channels that you may not exactly want. Additionally, they raise their prices at least yearly forcing you to call in and negotiate a package deal. Also, I did not have any issues with installation as the provider was on time and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this service to anyone that is interested in using Comcast/Xfinity.", "We recently have our router updated and the guy was nice and had no problems but we had to call and ask for an update because we were still using the original one they gave us when we signed up and a friend told us it needed updated. They have been very nice and helpful every time I contacted them. Usually when there's a problem an automated voice will explain why and then you have the option to speak to someone if you still want to but I usually don't. \r\n\r\nFor the most part the internet works just fine for me except for when I try to do too many things at once but that could be my computer speed. I'm really not sure. My husband on the other hand likes to play online games and gets very upset when it lags which is fairly often but I also think the computer he's using is a big part of his problem. The internet usually doesn't go out very often maybe every couple months. There are times though that it will keep going out for a few minute or hours for a few days and they don't inform customers what's going on unless you call and talk to them.", "They've always been reliable and trustworthy and I feel secure with them. I am a customer through Xfinity Comcast and they are there 24/7 if something happens to your internet. If I have any problem with my internet service I call them and the service is fixed within the hour. I have been an Xfinity Comcast customer for 4 years and the internet the speed has been super fast with every page I open and it only takes 6 seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen I first got Xfinity Comcast; the worker came to the house and installed the wifi and the modem within the hour and I was able to use the internet right away after they set up an account with my username and password. So with everything they had to install and set up took about an hour and a half. Also, the customer service experience with Xfinity Comcast was amazing. When I was having problems with my internet service and the internet would not work I called the customer service number and my internet service was up and running within an half an hour.", "Comcast's service is very reliable and has only gone down twice since I have had it. It's great and I recommend it. What makes it great is how strong the signal is through my entire house. When you download a movie or show, it is very fast, and even pictures zip down quite fast. I was surprised. This is much faster than competitors. I self-installed the system and it was very easy since it came with instructions to help me set it up. When I had an issue with a cable, it was quick and easy to solve and I was up and running in no time at all.", "XFINITY claims to be the best but they are ** and truly I'm offended because this dusty ** boy was here for 4 hours 3 weeks ago telling me this is so much better AT&T and telling my son he is gonna have strong Wi-Fi in his room only for this ** to be slow asf = to not working and worse than AT&T. I am throwing my router and cable boxes in the ** garbage this was so rude!!!", "They aren't knowledge people and don't care about their customer. The only thing they care about is how they can cheat you out of money. I even asked for a supervisor and she was worst than the first person I spoke to. They need a lot of training on how to talk to customers.", "We experienced the usual nightmares with Comcast while using their bundled services for cable and Internet. We switched to FiOS several years ago (who we love) and terminated our contract with Comcast. At the time of termination, we paid our final bill and turned in all equipment. We were paid in full and clear of all further obligations. Now, years later, we've received a notice from Southwest Credit collecting on behalf of Comcast for $564.63. We don't owe this and have never received a bill from Comcast. I'm sure this is just another one of their business practices, to try to extort money from people. Comcast is the worst company I've ever used. I cannot for the life of me understand how they're still in business.", "I've had Comcast for years and it has always been reliable service. When I need help I just call and they help or send someone right out. I'm thankful to have them. Customer service reps were very friendly over the phone. And when they came out they were friendly, presentable, knowledgeable, and helpful. Comcast was fast and efficient with the installation process and timing. The installers were very fast and helpful with instructions on connecting and using the wifi. They helped with placing and learning where it all is. The best thing is having great speed and also working all the time and never glitching. I use two tvs and three computers along with other phones and the wifi is still fast and reliable!", "Comcast Internet Service was super fast with different speeds to choose from so that you can get what is right for your family. It is very reliable and never had a slow period and an outage. Super quick upload and no waiting on pages to load. Also, the technician was friendly and on time. He was very quick with what he had to do and he finished early. He talked and explained everything he was doing. The customer service reps are also always friendly and willing to help. You never have to wait very long to talk to someone. I never had a bad experience with them.", "I never worked directly with Comcast, but I reap the benefits and they are fine. The internet is fast, but it still takes a few days to get back to us when the Internet was being particularly slow or even disconnected. Seeing as we have jobs that require internet connection, this is quite inconvenient. The speed is not very fast, but I've also seen slower. We have a big house and it doesn't reach to all areas of the house. Also during the installation, we were told they were going to have a put a rod on our house and that it has been known to cause fires in lightning storm. Somewhat disconcerting and concerning, so we put the rod next to the house.", "Their installer came out and quickly did an efficient job and even though there was some confusion he corrected it and made things right. Comcast is a reliable Internet connection and speed without all the crashes and disconnects of most other ISPs. The internet speed is very fast and there's no noticeable lag in gaming on a console and across my laptop and desktop... I am very satisfied with the experience I've had. Also, their customer service is very helpful and considerate... The ones I have spoken to. They were thoughtful and offered some kind of assistance when needed... Very grateful to have them here.", "Comcast has worked ok but it ran a bit slower than usual. It never kicked me off but just loaded slower. Some days it would work at a faster pace depending on how many devices were linked up to the internet. It's very annoying. Whenever it's just one device running on it it's super fast and gets the job done. The installation was fast and the tech was very respectful. He put on shoe covers so my carpet wouldn't get dirty and cleaned up after himself. Customer service was always willing to help whenever I have a question or problem. They also have someone out within a day if I need any repairs. Also they will explain my bill if I ever doubt anything or have an issue.", "My installation experience and the customer service were great. The technician was in and out in about 20 minutes and after that we got to use the Internet with no problem. Then, if we ever had a problem we just give them a call. They were polite very professional when we had to deal with them and very courteous. Also, my Internet service providers' reliability was great because it never cut us off, never shut us out, never broke in the middle of anything to cut us off.", "The installation was very easy. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. It only took a couple minutes to set it up, change the password, and have working internet. In our location, the internet runs smoothly. We haven't had any of the common disconnecting issues either, so this provider has made us very happy. The speed is phenomenal. We play games, so we download quite a few over the years. This is the fastest I've ever had my games download. It's been almost eight months now and I haven't even had to deal with a customer service representative yet, which makes me very happy as I hate making phone calls.", "You now have to pay for installation of the equipment and the customer servicemen they send out are often late rude and unprofessional. They also sometimes don't bring the right equipment which slows down the progress of the installation. The customer service is often rude too. They talk over you and interrupt you while you're speaking. I've even had a customer service worker yell at me over the phone and threaten me. My internet is often slow and/or the high speed anything is almost nonexistent. Which is kind of funny considering it's one of their main incentives to get you to choose their company over the rest. I also pay higher fee for higher speed and it's no better than the lower priced internet service.", "The installers came in and out pretty quickly at the right scheduled time, so we didn't have to wait for them. They also gave us all the necessary tools to fix issues ourselves. Their customer service were friendly and helpful too. When we first called in. They were thorough and explained things in a way that we could understand. They also gave discounts as often as they could. \r\n\r\nOur internet runs slow at times but Comcast provides help when needed. It is also reliable in the sense that they give you a callback after a project has been put through. It could be much faster, though. We are already paying for one speed but not getting what we were promised. When we called in about it, all they say is it will come.", "It's really fast and it never moves slow. It is easy to get it to do whatever you want. It is very reliable. It has never stopped working when it is supposed to be working. Like when the bill has been paid. It did not take long for the workers to hook it up and it did not take long for the company to make it work. It is very easy to hook up and connect so you can get started using it. The customer service is very good to me. They are always kind towards me and they seem to always have something nice to say to me. When I need help, they are always ready, willing and able to help me.", "Comcast tends to have good download speeds and is great for online gaming, plus streaming music and video. Their service rarely gets bogged down by multiple devices at once. I've never had any issues with speed besides during regular maintenance hours, early in the morning. Their installation is quick, if not totally painless. The service technicians can be a bit gruff, but they are good about getting everything done and not leaving a mess. Their customer service department is often rude and unsupportive. If I can get an issue fixed without calling them, I will. Thankfully, most issues can be fixed after searching them online.", "The installers were on time and professional. We did have issues with proper installation though as there were issues with the internet connecting with the TV so we were unable to use some of the services that were available. but the service seemed to work fine most of the time as it was reliable and secure. The speed was really good as it seemed like it connected very quickly and enabled us to get what we needed in a fast fashion. It was faster than their competitors. The biggest area of concern was the price they charged as it was way more expensive than their competitors. Also, their customer service was not very helpful at all in resolving the issues with it working properly as they came out several times and were unable to resolve the issues which caused us to leave them.", "Comcast showed up on time and explained everything they were doing. The guy then showed us how to work the remote and all of the features. He was very professional. I am very happy with the download and upload speed. There are times though when the kids in the neighborhood are out of school that there seems to be a lag and the internet slows down. The service is reliable and has very little downtime. Once in awhile if there is a bad storm, the service may go out. They usually are able to restore it in a reasonable timeframe.", "I usually don't have a problem with this service. It works well. When we do have a problem, we call and they can usually fix it in no time. Installation is good. My husband hooked up all the modem all the while talking to a technician. Installation many years ago was quick and easy. The guy who came was professional and super helpful. Customer service is great. We called a while ago to ask why our bill is always so high. After asking us some simple questions, our bill was lowered to a reasonable amount which was great. I never had a problem with the speed. We can watch clips on our tablets with no problem as well as downloading contents onto our devices.", "The technician that came to our home was on time, very courteous and was definitely very knowledgeable. It didn't take him very much time at all to install everything that we wanted. Comcast has very fast speed and reliability and we almost never experienced any service outages. When we did experience them, it usually didn't take very long for service to restore. I would also definitely recommend them for speed. I did a speed test on several occasions and it was always where it was supposed to be. I had to call customer service a couple of different times to find out why my Internet wasn't working. The rep I spoke with was very knowledgeable and offered to follow up with me when the time frame was up for the service to be restored.", "The installers didn't do the installation all the first time and had to get them back to put in wires, due to some water, it was causing the stall. However after two to three times it went OK and all is running fine. It took a bit long however they got the work done in the end. They could improve with honest guys to install and service time to come install. Also, customer service are kind but didn't help answer my problems which took longer to figure out. They can do better and be even more honest with pricing and helpful to their customers. Sometimes Comcast can be late on results and charge mistakes but if watched and regular user they seem to work out well. I would watch and keep an eye on everything just in case but they are pretty good. They provide easy and fast service.", "I am pretty satisfied with Comcast internet service. The internet speed is the best part. If having XFINITY the speed of the internet service provider is second to none and I would recommend it to anyone. However, the weather is bad in Michigan a lot, and sometimes when the weather is bad, the system skips out and jumps a lot. The connection is broken, then it is hard to connect with Customer Service. Their customer service is just ok, but the customer service reps sometimes do not have the best attitude. They are not well informed and they don't note anything. The installation is good now but at first we had a lot of problems because the installation was not good and it took about a year to get it right.", "The tech people was there on time, which was a nice surprise since I hate waiting. They were very clean and tidy too, installed everything really fast, and very professional. Customer support is there for you 24/7, very helpful and responsive, regardless of if it's a tiny problem or a major issue. Very nice people, very clear with their instructions, always eager to listen and help. 100% responsive, and almost no waiting time. Comcast has very reliable, really stable connection with very rare drops that are fixed quickly. Solid 50 Mbytes down, and up to 5 Mbytes up, very worth its price. I can watch Twitch and my husband can be downloading something while watching Netflix and it won't stutter at all.", "We had a problem with the wiring inside when we first got Comcast Internet Service and they came back and fixed it right away with no extra charge for me. Also anytime I called for an issue which was very few times they were very helpful and I didn't have to stay in hold an annoying amount of time. All in all this was a good provider for service. They 2 men that came were very polite and wore booties over their shoes with me not even having to ask them. Also they cleaned up well once they were done and that's a plus with me! Customer service was good. They knew what they were doing and we're very helpful unlike a lot of customer service I have experienced with other companies. We live in an area where we can't get a lot of different providers so the speed was pretty good and we didn't have a lot of issues with it. So I would recommend it.", "I'm generally satisfied with the quality of Comcast's internet and cable. The internet is mostly fast and reliable. There is no buffering. I don't have to worry about waiting for videos to come on. I've experienced the opposite before and this is a much better experience. The internet sites that I use and services make this is pretty much a necessity. But the customer service can be very frustrating. When issues occur I sometimes get a few different answers but gets resolved. It instantly is fixed when problem is addressed and service fixed right then. I don't have to wait long at all and it makes Up for initial delays. I was also pretty satisfied with installation. It was relatively quick and not messy or ugly but the hours to wait were inconvenient. The knowledge of installer was very good and problems were fixed right away.", "Comcast was very reliable. I had no issue with my service or connectivity and customer service was always helpful if I needed it. They took time to listen and understand why I was calling and did their best resolve my issue in a timely manner. They were very professional. Their employees are friendly and respectful and knew what they were doing and the installation didn't take long. I didn't have to wait for weeks like some other companies. Also, the Internet speed is fantastic. It's very fast and reliable connectivity. I was able to game and stream music and movies with ease. No hassle no buffering. Very reliable internet. Would recommend this company to all my friends and family.", "Comcast's service and quality of product is garbage. I have no choice either Comcast or satellite. I would rather have Verizon. I just had the technician give me the two cable boxes because I've been in the industry and I know the garbage work they do. They hit you with all these hidden charges that I wasn't going to pay when I could do a quality work vs piecework the cable provider Comcast provide. Plus they always give you the run-around. You cannot get a direct answer. The cable box prompt Beyond slow. Talking to a representative slow so in general Comcast is slow. I will deal with it until I move but Comcast is beyond horrible.", "Comcast didn't crash as often as some internet providers that I've had in the past. I was able to download music and apps a lot quicker and easier with this provider. Also, I am able to stream videos a lot easier as well. The installation process was kind of tricky for me. It took me a while but once I had it set up it wasn't a hassle for me at all and I didn't have to unplug anything for it to work. Customer service has always been kind to me whenever I did have problems. They were nice and helped me through whatever situation was in and help me solve whatever was wrong.", "Installers put the internet connection in very quickly and had great customer service. I have a dog and they were very attentive to him. It was very nice. The gentleman was very knowledgeable. He answered all of my questions until I could understand. They treated my home very well. However, the internet is very unreliable, would slow down all the time. It seemed as if the tiniest storm would cause it to go out. Most of the time the speed is okay, but when we add any WiFi capabilities such as phone or laptop the speed slows significantly. Makes it hard to let visitors use the service. Online or phone customer service is lacking as well. I hate when I have to call, I'm always going to be put on hold for up to twenty minutes.", "Comcast gave a specific time the installers would arrive instead of a several hour \"window\". They arrived on time and finished quickly. The employees were very professional too. Our internet service was very fast and rarely had outages. And even though I signed up for one of their lower packages my speed was always as advertised when I checked it. There was never any lag or slowness experienced. Their Customer service was great too when I called to report outages and service was usually restored very quickly. I only had to call a few times but when I did hold times were very short. Every representative I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.", "It was easy to do the installation. It doesn't take a long time and there's not a lot of cords to worry about where they go, or make it confusing. They come and do it quickly and if you ever need to move or unplug it, it is very easy to put back together. The internet service was very reliable and I had no problems. The speed is great and the pages load fast. You don't have to sit and wait 5 mins for a page to load and it comes up almost instantly. I had no problems with the speed. Their customer service was great too. They were very polite and professional. They knew the products and could answer any question you might have.", "I have been using my current internet provider for a couple years now. I am really satisfied with my service. I have a good speed and there have been hardly any service interruptions. I have recently upgraded my service so that I would have the best speed for what I wanted to do. When the upgrade was requested by me it took only a few minutes to get me up to the speed I wanted to be at. When there is a time when the internet is down it is fixed really quickly and with no calls to customer service. When I have had to call customer service the reps are nice and friendly and seem to care about fixing my problem as soon as possible. I have had reps call me back to make sure all is working well. \r\n\r\nIn addition, every time I have had to call customer service I have been able to speak with intelligent and friendly reps. I have always felt like the reps were concerned with whatever my problem was. They took the time to fix my problem each time. I have not had to call that often but when I did I felt confident I would be their number one priority until my problem was fixed. \r\n\r\nWhen I had my service installed I was so surprised at how fast and easy the process was. I was told a time the technician would be at my home and he was here right on time. He took the time to tell me exactly what he was gonna do in each step in detail. Once installed he took the time to make sure it was working and showed me all I needed to know about using my service.", "When Comcast came to install, I had people who knew what they were doing and I had no problems with them at all. The connection is great and their customer service is very good. They have very nice people and any issues that I have had they are very quick to fix. I would recommend them to a family member or friend because it's extremely speedy and has given me very little problem. I just absolutely love it.", "It was a pretty good experience with Comcast. Installation was fast. The employees know exactly what they're doing. Were very kind with respecting my house. Even took time to put something over their shoes so my floor would not get dirty. Just fantastic job. Customer service is great. They treat you good and are very kind. Their reliability was overall good. Fast to fix any issues. Always concerned for their customers being satisfied. Would definitely recommend to any family or friends.", "The installation of my Comcast took no time. There is just one box and one cord and I'm able to connect to the Internet anywhere in the house. It's reliable. My high speed Internet is always just that. I never have a loading issue or a connection problem. It turns on fast and I'm able to download at a good speed. One time I couldn't connect to the Internet on my phone but thankfully to my high speed I connected to my Internet service and it picked it up on my phone and I was able to use my phone right away. If there is ever a problem or if I can't pay on time, Comcast is very understandable and patient with me. I never had a problem getting any type of issue resolved.", "Comcast Internet Service is very reliable. Never had any issues! I would highly suggest this company to anyone who is looking! The installation went very smooth and easy. It did not take long at all and the technician was very knowledgeable. My customer service experience was the best. Anytime I ever had a problem I always received the most prompt customer service from the nicest reps. They always made sure the problem was solved in a timely manner and went above and beyond.", "They did not come on time but when they did come it was a pretty quick installation so that was a plus but still annoying. They never answer the phone or whenever I have a issue they take forever to get back to me for some reason and calling and speaking to a computer every single time is really annoying. When I do get a live real person it's much easier and better and they are normally super nice. Also, the internet speed for the most part is good unless there are a bunch of devices connection. I normally have to reset it which is very very very annoying but I deal with it cause they are the cheapest.", "Xfinity is a very reliable ISP. I have been a Customer for over 6 years and they have awesome speeds for their internet. I think they have some of the fastest speeds around and anytime they get faster speeds they give me the option of upgrading for an additional fee of course. The installation process was very simple. It took about 20 mins and my services were up and running with no problems. If you do self install they give you step by step instructions which makes it easy to do it yourself if you do not want to wait for a technician. At first calling Customer service was like a headache but now they have gotten better with helping people with their issues and making them feel important. I can definitely see improvements.", "I have been a customer for at least 12 years --I AM SUPPOSE TO PAY $19.99 + $10.00 EQUIPMENT TOTAL $29.99 --But every month, I get different charges like March $144.00 the company were charging me for HD and 2 boxes which I did not have!! They asked me to pay after credit $93.40 and they said, \"You are ok.\" I paid all in March --then April 2017 they said that I owe 100+ called back and the supervise apologized.\r\n\r\nThey made a mistake charging $60.00 for a technicians and 9.95 extra box --mistake - I looked for my box and installed, gave me a credit. I was told to paid $30.69  - same mistake. May 2017 --fixed. But every months, I am getting the wrong bill always charging more that $ 29.99 as my contract. The service has been really bad. Today JUNE 8/2017 CALLED. THE FIRST AGENT hang up on me and called back and talked to MISS ERIKA VERY RUDE. She said you paid that and period. I asked her please looked at the history as per Supervisor KENVERLY I had to paid only $30.69 and for May 2017 and all would be normal. BUT WRONG THEY CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT AND GAVE A VERY BAD SERVICE.\r\n\r\nThis last supervisor or person in charge MISS ERIKA WAS BAD AND RUDE. How a company can treat their customer as bad? My account **. I requested the cheapest cable $19.99 and $10.00 equipment. No more but they keep charging what they want. REALLY BAD SERVICE. Please check on this and what kind of service you give. Thanks.", "I have been deeply disappointed by the moving process. They have initially accommodated my request by setting a suitable date and I was told the arrangement will be sent over by email confirming the whole thing. No email has been received after 3 days. When I called to enquire I was told the installation had been rescheduled for a later date without me knowing. When I tried to negotiate I was told there was no alternative and they could just cancel my order to move my services. When I said I am stopping the services I was told that they would be automatically stopped on the date agreed upon in the arrangement. So there we are, that is the way customers are treated by Comcast. I am switching to another service provider who has accommodated all my requests.", "I have tried now 5 times to get help with sporadic missing emails. Five calls have resulted in no help at all. I give them a reference number from a previous call, but they just start over and do the same stuff again. The folks who answer the phone have little to no troubleshooting skills and they refuse to pass your call up to a higher level of service... perhaps that is because a higher level of service does not exist. They promise to call back in 2 hours with an answer. No one has EVER called me back. There is NO customer service at all, they have no interest in helping. My next call is going to a request to cancel services. ANY service has to better than Comcast.", "I just representative. I could not get my information and therefore I can get into my account which I couldn't get into my account into my old account with them. They charge me extra. CenturyLink let's give you a chance with your customer service.", "My internet price is different every other month. It started at 39.00 and I'm now at 74.00. The price went up $34 in 2 years and I have the same service. I have to call and waste 30 mins of my time every other month. It's a joke. This company is out of control and needs to be regulated. It's too bad Fios rates are not comparable.", "Installation of Comcast Internet service was ok and got it for free. I could have done it myself but did not have that option. With Comcast Internet service, there is not many outages. In bad weather it still stays on. Price is decent too although sometimes it's hard to talk to a real person. Once you do they just try to talk you out of it and sell you something else. Sometimes it's good but other times is slow. Router needs to be reset. I'm not sure why it's slow sometimes but still worth the product. Not the greatest but would still recommend.", "The installation was done several years ago but it was quick and very efficient. This was done by Comcast as part of cable TV and telephone installation so the Internet service was just part of it. It is difficult to separate the Internet from the rest. The cost is very reasonable considering it is bundled with my cable TV and the telephone. Also, the customer service for all of the Comcast products has been very quick and efficient. Most problems have been able to be fixed by phone but when an in home service call is required they have been prompt and solved the problem. We have had no interruption. It has been very reliable and the down and upload speed has been very adequate. Compared with some of the other suppliers that I have heard of the speed is outstanding. My wife and I have two computers and use them both many hours a day.", "Installation was fairly quick, but I do not like a time window for arrival. Installer was very knowledgeable and polite. I also do not like the wait time on the telephone, but I like being offered deals or discounts when there is a problem. And I would like money off of my bill when the service is down. For me, Comcast is expensive, and the internet service would go out randomly even during nice weather. It's not good with online school work to complete. But the speed is good. I found it compatible with other home internet service providers.", "Set up was relatively easy and pain-free. It is easy to install yourself and get working almost immediately. Definitely better than some companies. But I find their customer service to be very lacking. They are often not eager to help, and tend to fight you with any issue you may have. They definitely need to improve in this area. The speed is pretty good, but not as good as my experience with other companies BUT I have also had worse. Also, they are one of the more popular companies but I feel as though they hyped themselves up a lot, but fail to actually deliver.", "The internet service is fast and works great at times! The speed is good quality -- my surfing of the internet and having many tabs open for school work is convenient and there is rarely a lag, unless it suddenly decides to shut off. For some reason it goes in and out -- even when only one person is using it! It can be frustrating since I am a college student and would like to work at home! Also, the wires can be confusing and one small move could possibly mess the connection up!", "Easy with instructions to have yours installed at home. Like a do it yourself kind if thing. And staff is always a phone call away. Great communication. If you have a problem, just chat with a customer service Representative. They will help and be friendly about it compared to other companies. I have like a friend in these people. They are so nice!!! I like them. Very very reliable. Had no big issues. Only if it was bad weather. But What do you expect in that circumstances. I would highly recommend them.", "Comcast is an awesome company. It has very fast speeds and no problems at all great for gaming or anything you need Internet for. There are no lag or slow speeds at all and although at times it does run slow due to weather or outages but for the price you can't go wrong with this speed. However, customer service can be better. They are sometimes mean and say that you need to pay more to get better speeds. But overall great service and would call them if I need help. Also, the installation was fast and easy. Someone came out and help me through it all. He didn't get mad and with no questions stood an hour to explain if problems happen. I would recommend this provider to anyone.", "Installation was quick and the technicians are very helpful with any questions you might have while your equipment is being installed. I enjoy installing myself but my home needed to be wired. Internet is fast and very reliable. The storms don't bother it and I can play movies, videos and download easily without issues. Never have any issues, if I need something customer service is always helpful! The reps are also very friendly and quick at what they do. They get the job done and do it within a reasonable amount of time. Remember they are trying their best!", "It is very rare that our internet service has any issues. The speed is wonderfully fast and we can multitask on various devices without seeing any lag, which is awesome considering how much we do. There are many times I'm playing a game on my phone or looking at social media, searching the web, streaming Netflix, and more while my fiance does work involving the internet in his home office. Installation was super easy. We already had a modem and such. We only needed someone to come and check it and give us a related cable box but otherwise it was fast. Since we have very little issues with the internet service, there is little need to contact the provider. That said, they have been helpful when needed.", "It is expensive but I really like using Comcast because their internet is of really good quality and I am willing to pay the price for it. But the internet speed could be faster. Their customer service people are sometime rude but for the most part they are nice and helpful.", "Comcast has a low income service that has a very reasonable price. Quick installation and the installer was friendly, professional and on time. I was leery at first but had no issues. He didn't even have to drill any holes in the wall. I highly recommend them. Speed has been fast and reliable. We have two phones and two tablets, and I am very happy with my speed. The automatic customer service was fast and easy to follow.", "They are always reliable and super fast 24 hours a day. I don't think we have experience downtime so far. I can have multiple machine on downloading videos and there is no issue on doing that. I can always rely on the speed of the internet to get things done. The installation was also super easy. The people at Xfinity know what they are doing and does a good job at it. The only downside is the modem. You either have to buy off Xfinity or rent it every month. But the customer service is always helpful when I contact them. I can always either call or email and get a fast response. Overall, they do a good job providing support to their customer.", "Comcast came out and installed rather quickly and the rep was very polite. I have great connectivity and reliability on all phones and laptops, etc. There are times when we have an issue with it lagging, but as we are running over ten devises on one network I'd say its rather impressive overall. Sometimes it slows down for a few mins but it catches back up and runs smoothly most often than not!\r\n\r\nHowever, I have 3 kindle fire tablets in the house that run with a MAC address and about 35% of the time it won't recognize those devises and connect. The customer support people haven't been any help as of yet, but the are trying. I have been in contact with them multiple times and they have always been courteous and continue to find solutions which I appreciate. The installer also came out a second and third time to attempt to find a solution and I'm satisfied overall. I love the rest of the service but as I run my business and my kids only play on the kindles it is rather irritating when it won't work a third of the time. But I do appreciate their great speed on the rest of the devises.", "Overall Comcast has bad wi-fi. Internet is very slow and frustrating, I can hardly use it at times. Pages take forever to load and our TV freezes at times because of signal. We didn't have any problems when installing. It was fast and quick. Their crew was friendly, nice to talk to and let me know what was going on at all times. Customer service is sometimes not good. They're not very helpful when it comes with wi-fi problems. We're always on hold. We get no help when TV goes out or when we lose power during storms. They don't care about our wants and needs, and it's too much money. Very unsatisfactory.", "Comcast/Xfinity is very reliable. The internet speed is very fast and never really slows down throughout the month. I have never had a shortage or unexpected interruption in my service. There have been times where I haven't paid my bill yet and they haven't disconnected my service. I call those grace periods. I feel like they know me and that I am on good terms with them. The installation was easy and great. The technician comes in, installs all of the services, and shows me how to operate them. The techs are friendly and very knowledgeable. The customer service at Comcast Xfinity has always been great. They listen to your problems and try to resolve them as quickly and accurately as possible. The people are friendly and usually always know what to do to help.", "Installation was so fast and so easy. All the installation guy did was ask a few questions about our plug-ins. Plus, my customer service experience was great. They treat you with respect and are willing to help you with any problems that you may have regarding the situation. The internet speed is awesome and always fast no matter what. I guarantee it is the best. You can practically look at anything you want without any worries about any problems.", "The internet from this provider is very quick and reliable. It does sometimes freeze up or randomly turn off. It sometimes becomes very slow, and it sometimes stops working completely, causing my computer to crash while attempting to reload the websites. But other than that it is a very good service. The installation was quick and easy, and the process of installation was also quick. It may also depend on whether or not the client has a router already set up, but overall the service starts working almost immediately. Sometimes the employees are a little stubborn when it comes to certain issues, and sometimes when in communication with them because of an extra fee that isn't supposed to be there, they insist that there is nothing to complain about.", "I am very happy with my service. My internet has always worked and I have never had any speed or reliability issues since I have been a Comcast customer. Web pages connect quickly and smoothly, disconnecting and reconnecting are not an issue. The technician that installed was great and explained everything perfectly. He did his job well and did not leave a mess behind. I have never had an issue with my lines. However, when I have had to reach out to customer service, it is a pain. They are not located usually in the United States and they do not know anything about our cable system.", "*************************\r\npublished on: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SIKnlf1eZtsJ:https://comcast.pissedconsumer.com/comcast-review-in-telecommunications-category-201702171010168.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ph\r\n*************************\r\n\r\nI don't even know where to begin. I got married in October. While I was on my honeymoon, my bank sent me a chip card and deactivated my old card. This meant I was one week late on my payment. I paid my bill as soon as I got home and realized what had happened. Flash forward 4 months later... I continued making payments on my new card and received confirmations for every payment. Suddenly, my Internet gets shut off. I start an online chat with customer service. They tell me that I have not paid since November. Every payment has been taken out of my account. They apologize and say they will turn out back on right away. 8 hours later and still nothing. I call customer service and they tell me that I have to pay $100 to get it turned back on! They say that they can see the attempted payments every month but because I was late that one month, they will not turn it back on without the deposit because I am not a reliable customer. I work in hotels and swore that I would never write a bad review but this goes to far. I have never dealt with ruder people. It is complately unacceptable that a company would do this to someone who has been a loyal customer for years. Word of mouth spreads quicker than any advertisement and I will make sure to tell anyone I know about the terrible Ave dishonest service I received.", "Comcast's wifi service was slow and would kick me offline. Streaming movies was also difficult. I would have to download the movie for two hours prior to watching it. I prefer to stream rather than download. Also, it took awhile for the picture to clear. When you have a high def 4K tv, picture quality is important. Being able to use the tv at its best with slow speed is frustrating. Installation was quick and the service employee was very friendly. They have great installers. They answered questions, provided direct contacts if any problems were to occur. Customer service seems to be the best quality. But I wonder if it is because they deal with too many complaints and know the routine or if they truly care and understand their customer needs.", "My cable & internet always works great. I've never had any major issues in 7 years of service. Downloading & streaming are very fast, consistent and reliable. I truly cannot believe how quick this internet is. They are highly recommended. In addition, the customer service reps always answer when I call & they are always quick to fix any problems I may have. They are a good value for the amount of money that is due every month for the bill. On the other hand, the only issue with installation was they give you an 8-hour window to be home. They said they would be over between 8-4 pm on a Monday.", "Internet installation was simple fast and easy and very professional service. It was fast, simple and easy. There was a very friendly technician too. Comcast has fast, reliable service with very little down time. There are also hot spots on the go. It's an awesome and perfect company. I love them and I been a long time customer... I'm running on 60 GB and that's plenty for my entire family, including 4 phones and a desktop all running on wifi. Totally awesome seed. Their customer service has always been pleasant as well. Every time I have issues with a bill, I call them and problem is fixed fast without any hassles like with some companies.", "I had to do the installation myself and was easy. They guided me through the whole thing on the phone and I liked the easy instructions that they gave me. The service had limits on GB of internet that I could use which was kind of a problem for me but overall everything else was good. The speed of this internet was kind of slow at the beginning but then I called and they fixed the problem for me. their customer service is great too. Every time I called with a question they were there to help and fast. I didn't have to wait long on hold. Compared to other customer service it was beyond great.", "Comcast is average and not special. They take some time to answer questions when they are contacted by email and then the messages aren't super clear. During installation they were clean and fairly quick and on time most of the time. They didn't need to pull any cable in the walls but had to add a booster which cost more money. Its speed is ok and allows for gaming but sometimes there is lagging when we have three or more online at the same time. The speeds go down when this happens.", "I love the customer service, always helpful. I am very satisfied and happy with them. They are so friendly and nice. Every time I call with questions or comment they answer right away. Also, the installers were right on time and very friendly. They were very fast at installing the internet and made sure if I has any questions and answered them great. Moreover, I am very impressed by the speed of the internet. When I watch movies or stream shows it does not buffer or is all glitching. Plus they load right away so I am not waiting forever to start movies or shows. I would highly recommend it to everyone in my family and friends.", "My Comcast runs great in perfect weather. The speed is very fast. There is literally zero waiting time. Even movies and large downloads are extremely quick. The only times it is slow is under poor weather or heavy Internet usage days like an election or cyber Monday. Extremely simple installation, and there are no cords everywhere. It looks great in every Internet connected room in my home. I called two times for assistance, and after a satisfactory waiting period, all of my questions & situations were spoken about and resolved in a friendly and efficient manner. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone considering it.", "Internet never goes down and price is comparable to other services. It is high speed. We use several devices in my house. We have smart phones, computers and tablets that may be used at the same time. Installer was on time and courteous and professional. He completed installation quickly. He was neat and put on foot booties before entering my house. He made sure everything was working correctly before he left. Customer service was good. Any time I need to call they are very professional and nice. They answered my call quickly and answered my questions properly.", "Our Comcast service is almost always working. We have only had a few times in the past 10 years when it was down. We live rurally so some things are out longer in our location but we have not had this problem with Comcast. Our internet speed is good. Once in a while a video will pause and buffer for a few seconds but it rarely lasts long and doesn't usually cause much of a disruption. It has been years ago since we had our cable and internet installed. It went smoothly. However, I thought the man that came out to do the installation was not very friendly and was not very helpful with my questions. Customer service has been okay (not great) with Comcast. We have better luck getting the help we need when visiting the physical Comcast store but the wait was very long! It was worse than the DMV for wait times.", "As with any provider when service goes out it is an irritant. I play a game on my iPhone that requires a fast connection. I have seen dozens of times when my opponent loses because the connection isn't working. It has never happened to me. Then when service goes out sometimes the people that answer have little training in what to do. All they know to do is send a reboot signal. However this is not unique to my provider. Still, the CS people that answer are pleasant. They do sometimes seem slow in recognizing an outage but I suspect that is more of a consumer problem (people not reporting a problem). At any rate, the person that did an update about 6 months ago was efficient and knowledgeable. When he found out we didn't use our landline, he hooked it up to our printer so we can send and receive faxes.", "Comcast is reliable, however there are periods where the service cuts out, or slows down. Most of the time I have no problems with the service. It was painless and easy to have installed. It was done well and I have had very few problems since I began the service. All issues I have had with this internet service provider have been dealt with in an efficient and professional manner. It is priced fairly well also.The highest speed available is pricey but worth it. However the next fastest speed is quite a drop. I would like to see a speed available that falls between the two options. Other than that, I have been happy to be a subscriber and I would recommend it to someone else.", "They are very reliable, fast and affordable. I love using the internet and this makes but fast and easy to do so. Installation was quick and easy. Everything you need Tonkin is right there in the manual and if necessary a service man could do it for you and be out of your house and out of your hair in 10 to 15 minutes. Customer service is off the charts great. The people are very respectful and always remember that the customer is always right. I would recommend Comcast to anyone who was looking to buy a internet device and did not know where to go or what to do. This is genuinely amazing and you it was one the best decisions I have made with regards to my electronic service a long time.", "The XFINITY service was pretty easy for the worker to hook everything up. We had Internet, DVR, and TV installed and it took about one hour and service was up pretty fast. However, their customer service is Really bad, their lines are always full and it takes forever to talk to someone and even then the person you're on sounds like they don't care most of the time. Also, when it's up the speed is great but Comcast have a habit of capping your speeds even though there is currently no data cap over here. Then it frequently has service outages that their website never tells you about. It's also a Pain to cancel.", "This provider is very consistent. The service always gives me the same quality experience time and time again. Very few interruptions, and a great stream rate. The speed is fantastic. I stream music and video flawlessly, never suffering from lag or interruption. Load times are instant and reliable. The installation is thorough and very professional. Easy to schedule, and a customer friendly experience. All my questions are answered patiently. Easy and intuitive call in menu and that usually leads me to a solution. The in person experience is equally good, friendly and patient.", "When you have installation hooked up have to know what you are getting. I talked to a service provider and they sounded genuine. Told him or her to find the right installation they have and he or she was nice. They came through and fixed everything up and it is now up and running. They did an awesome job. Also, they are always helpful with any problems and great customer service. So it was a ok experience. It is useful and cool and the internet speed is fast. Comcast's a very trusted company. I would try to recommend it to a neighbor.", "I've had very little trouble with my Comcast Internet Service. The speed of my internet service has been great. Just a few power outages and they sent somebody right out. My experiences with them and their customer service has been great. They try to take care of the problem before they send out a technician. I have been with my internet provider over a year and have not had to contact customer service at all. I will not be changing services at present.", "Our internet is always connected and strong. It does reset often some days, but generally it works exactly like we would expect. We have no issues playing Netflix on 2 devices and games on a third. The connection is really good and fast. My husband installed it and had zero issues. Easy to set up, minimal fuss. Replacing the box was needed, but installing the new one took no time at all. That was a simple take in and get a new one. In store staff was very helpful, too. I assume that phone customer service would be as helpful.", "The installation tech was friendly and courteous. He explained to me how to use my new service in depth and made sure he answered any and all of my questions. The reliability of this provider is definitely on top. I never had a service with this fast of speed. I was able to use multiple devices at once and never felt like anything was being slowed down or overwhelmed. My connections were always great and rarely had problems with service interruptions. On the rare occasion I did have a service problem, the customer service associates always took care of it politely and fast. I felt they really cared about me.", "They came out fairly quickly if there was a problem or could help me fix issues over the phone. I rarely ever had my cable or internet service ever go out, even in bad weather. I use to have the highest speed you can have but then downgraded for financial reasons and got the next tier down. But I didn't really notice any difference in speed. The installers are fast, efficient, and knowledgeable. The only thing that is annoying is having to wait at home all day for them to come. The 4-5 hour windows are frustrating and sometimes you have to wait too long to get an appointment. Sometimes it's frustrating to have to sit on hold to get to talk to a real person but when you finally do they are usually friendly and knowledgeable.", "I have had Comcast for over 6 years and I have not had any major problems with their internet. The internet has been reliable every day, and I am especially happy because my house has college students and there were high school students and it requires a lot of internet use and homework. Comcast installation is satisfactory. Usually the only issue in installation is getting an appointment. The techs are usually booked or no available time slots during the week which are preferable. Comcast customer service has been up to par. I am a loyal customer and am treated so. Every time I have a problem I call the customer service line and the wait time is a little long but they are helpful. The internet speed has been fantastic. I wish it were faster but I'm spoiled. Internet speed isn't slow at all. There have not been generally any complaints in my household regarding the speed of the internet.", "The first installer did not know what he was doing and nothing worked correctly. The next person to come out said that it had been installed incorrectly and re-did everything so that it worked. The customer service, when you reach an actual person, is not bad. They are generally reliable but when you have to report a service disruption you get a recorded message saying they are aware of the problem but do not tell you when it might be fixed. Speed is not even. Sometimes it is quick and sometimes it is not, for no apparent reason that we have been able to learn nor get reliable instruction about.", "For Xfinity I can go anywhere and if there is xfinity around then I get Internet at the start. I love it. It makes it really convenient for me. Sometimes it's fast and sometimes it's slow, but I love that I have Internet almost everywhere. The installation was quick and easy. The just set it up and check if it is working and then they give you the password that you can change it to whatever you want so you can remember it. The customer service team is very friendly and to the point. They want to help you. And if you have any problems with anything they are doing they will help you to fix it.", "The installers came at the time they scheduled and were professional and courteous. The installation was quick and unobtrusive. They made sure all my questions were answered before they left. When our trial period was over and our prices went back up we could not afford the cable bill. I called Comcast to see if there was anything they could do to work with me on the price and they found a better plan for me. Comcast is pretty reliable, doesn't go out during storms or heavy winds. Can rely on quick speed even when multiple people are using it at the same time. The speed stayed consistently fast and didn't slow down during peak times.", "Usually the connection is stable, occasionally there are temporary outages. Those are usually very short and aren't a bad problem. The speed is pretty fast. It occasionally slows down on really High-Def videos, but usually surfing speeds are great. I never have any problem downloading anything. The installation was fairly simple, the installer guy was pretty nice and the setup did not take very long - possibly only an hour. The service worked immediately. I called customer service once because I had a problem with my internet connection randomly going out - it was a good call and my problem was resolved pretty easily within only like twenty minutes.", "I found their service to be quite reliable and consistent. I thought the internet speed was good, and perfect for my needs. I rarely had problems downloading anything, or during times of bad weather. On the few occasions that I needed customer service support, they were always polite and knowledgeable. I always ended the calls feeling that the questions or issues I had were completely resolved and done so in a short time span. In my opinion, XFINITY Internet Service absolutely lived up to their good reputation. The installation also went well and the process was fast and easy. Any questions that I had were answered, and they were very respectful and professional.", "The reliability has been good. There have not been many times when it has been down. When there are a lot of people on at the same time it does affect the reliability and I see a lag in the speed but nothing to complain about. I am happy with the speed of the internet. Very quick and easy installation. They installed it when they said they would and it did not take them very long which I'm very happy about the process. Customer service has been good. I have not needed to call very often but when I needed to they were helpful and courteous. I was pleased with the customer service I received.", "I haven't had any issues with the service shutting down or not working, and if for any reason it does, they are quick to get it back up and running. The installation process was great. They arrived on time and it took less time than the allotted time I was given. The installer was also very professional and knowledgeable about the product. I've had some issues with customer service in the past. They weren't very helpful or knowledgeable and sometimes I'd just end up hanging up. However within the last year they have gotten so much better. It's a huge improvement. The service is the best in the market. I also enjoy the fact that you can get high-speed internet just about anywhere with Xfinity Wifi. It works really well.", "When there's an issue with service they are very quick and efficient about discussing and handling the problem. When my service was first put in all it took was a simple phone call. I didn't have to go to the company which makes them very convenient for me. When the technician came to install everything I wanted, he explained everything in detail including service and apps, and guides. When there was a problem with switching when I moved, the technician showed up in under 12 hours and fixed everything. He was professional and prompt. Customer Service was helpful in getting my service set up and setting up times that were convenient. They helped me locate and install the app I needed for bill pay and they were very courteous and friendly. Very accommodating company. My internet speed is very fast. I can use split screen and not have any issues with the internet slowing down even with my kids downloading at the same time.", "Comcast always works for me and gives me the shows I enjoy. My kids also get all their shows. If I have a issue they fix it in great time. Always nice on the phone and even if you go in, got a sweet person to talk with you and help with the issue at hand. The installer came in great time and was respectful to me and my family, walked me through the process and showed me how to use it and set up how to use the controller. Customer service is always so nice and respectful to me and help me out with whatever I need and always willing to do all they can. Our internet service's speed never gives anyone in my house a issue. With 5+ people using it it's fast and keeps going and don't slow down. I'm happy with my services I get with them. Two thumbs up from my family.", "I've had it for 2 years, used it every day and had no problems with it. The installer was a very quick worker. He knew what he was doing, and answered all our questions we needed to know. It worked better than another provider. We lived in a bad spot and had bad weather but still got good service.The customer service reps are always friendly and answered our questions as we needed.", "The installation was very nice and easy. The work man who came to set it up was very nice and was really good at explaining what was happening. Comcast has really good customer service because every time I have a problem I am able to get a hold of someone who can figure out what's wrong. I really like the reliability of Comcast. It is always very easy to know that the internet will work well. It is really fast and from what I can tell it is better than most internet providers.", "Comcast provides high speed service at an affordable price. It is a great option for people like me and I would highly recommend it to others. Installation was completed in a timely fashion. There were no major issues, and the employees were all very helpful and knowledgeable. The customer service reps have always helped me when I needed it. I have had very few issues but when things did come up employees acted professionally and addressed my issues to my satisfaction. I can get all my work and homework done with efficiency because the speed is great and rarely have issues with lag. Download speeds are also very good.", "Comcast has amazing service. We scheduled installation and they arrived on time and were in and out very quickly. They answered all the questions we had and were great with keeping the place clean after they were done. They also have great customer service. We can call in and get fast and effective service. If they can't help right away they call back quickly and if we need them to come out they're here within hours.\r\n\r\nWe have great service, reliable and rarely goes out. We have super fast speed too. We upgraded and it normally is as fast or faster than we pay for. If there are ever problems with service they're quick to resolve. We get good rates too and if there are deals with other companies Comcast will match it since we have been with them for so long.", "The service guy arrived within the appointed time and got everything connected within an hour. He did a pretty thorough job and everything worked fine after he left. Upload and download speeds were satisfactory, not better or worse than the competition for the price we were paying. But it would have been nice if they offered a bit more. In the five years with Comcast, there were maybe less than ten major service disruptions. However, they did a good job notifying us of the issues and fixed the problem within a relatively short time. We've also had a couple of billing issues but they were also taken care of quickly.", "The internet speed is wonderful, don't have to wait long to download anything. Sites open right away, wifi is wonderful. It connects automatically and stays connected and is fast. However, I am extremely disappointed because when we got our wifi we were given a great price for the bundle then we ended up charged for things like a monthly modem fee that we were not told about in the beginning. Customer service is the worst... they are rude, they will lie to you to basically shut you up. I was also told twice that a supervisor would call me about being overcharged... NEVER HAPPENED. I'd recommend the wifi... just the wifi.", "The installation is very good. I myself always just do the self-installation which is cheaper and faster I think because I don't have to wait for an appointment. I love the speed of my internet. I usually have many devices on my internet and it still runs really fast. I have gotten a lot of comments from friends that my internet is so much faster than theirs. This company is very reliable. If there is an outage or something they always make sure to let everyone know and they really make sure to have the service back on in a good time. Company has wonderful customer service. They always try hard to make sure that the customers are taken care of. And if there is a problem they make sure to right the situation quickly.", "Speed is fine and the service consistently works well. We do a lot of video streaming and we have never had issues with it not connecting for extended periods of time, but we have had a few times that the connection speed was slower than normal. We have had fewer problems at our new address than we had at our old house. We chose to do our own installation. We did have to call and get assistance over the phone, but that process went smoothly. Installation at our old house was fine too. However, Comcast's customer service leaves much to be desired. First of all, the representatives frequently have such thick foreign accents it made it difficult to understand. We dropped our cable and phone through Comcast but kept the Internet.", "The installation for this service went great. It was right on time and everything went very smoothly. They also have the best customer service I have seen in a very long time. You will have no worries when contacting them either over the phone or online. I am very satisfied with my internet service speed. I have had no problems and can download like no one business. They did such a great job of making me happy and I would recommend them to everyone.", "When I moved into my house the cable company for the address was Comcast who offered internet. When I called Comcast their customer service representative was nice and I added internet to my cable. The speed is not as fast as some of the internet services I have used in the past but it will do. It's not like you have to wait on it. It's just that it seems slow to pull up pages sometimes. Also, the reliability is the same as any other internet service. It's not real fast or real slow. It drops service from time to time and is very frustrating but I can live with that because we get what we pay for.", "I am satisfied. The internet service is very reliable and very quick. I am able to download or watch movies rather quickly without any interruptions and the internet hardly ever stops to buffer to load movies, TV shows, etc.. It also has a great package of TV channels and there are hardly any problems with my internet on my laptops, home computer, etc. Also, it was a quick installation and the technician explained every detail very clear so that I can understand. He gave a step by step process of the installation and was in and out in under 15 minutes which was time efficient. And customer service is very reliable and usually sends out a technician quickly if I have any problems with either of my cable boxes. They help to explain solutions very clearly to any problems or concerns I may have.", "Love my internet and you can't beat the price. It's very reliable and we are happy with the speed which has never been an issue for us in the time we've had it. My family of four can all be on our different devices and play our Roku with no problem. The kids play on their tablets, us adults on our phones and we only have internet for TV. Sometimes if we are all on at the same time and playing our TV, my son's TV won't play. But honestly for what we pay a month now vs. what we were paying with AT&T, I can't complain! I could upgrade to a bigger package but really don't see a need to. And installation went smooth once they finally made it out here. It was 2 months from the time I ordered until the time they finally came out! I kept getting the runaround from them and empty promises on installation dates but they waived the $50 fee since it took them so long to come out.", "The internet service is very reliable and consistent. It is very seldom down and when it is down, it is usually for a very short period of time. Upload speeds are fast as well. And speed levels are as advertised. It is rare that I have to wait any amount of time for web pages to load up. When they are slow, it is usually more related to my computer itself and not internet speed. And the installation was very quick and easy and occurred in the amount of time stated. The representative was knowledgeable and personable. Also, customer service is wonderful. The agents are knowledgeable when resolving issues and they are very polite and friendly and make you feel like you aren't just a number.", "Their customer service is lacking. The connection usually works but sometimes it doesn't and it's always a struggle getting help from a customer service representative. Sometimes they are good but it usually takes a long time to talk to someone and they can never help me over the phone. They always have to send a technician to my house. Also, sometimes our cable is not the best and the TV stations will skip but it might be because of the wiring in my apartment not Comcast. The internet never has problems though and the wifi is always fast. It is much faster than my phone's 4g. There never really is internet connectivity problems and I'd probably recommend the internet.", "I am satisfied most of the time when I can download videos and games smoothly. But sometimes when I play games the connection can get funky. The reliability is not that great. Whenever I want to play a game or watch something I have to be mindful of my internet, which does not connect that well. Though I have not had to contact customer service, I remember it being really frustrating for my parents who had to deal with switching a new cable for some reason. However, it was fairly easy to get installed and the cable box is really small and convenient and can fit in any cupboard or stay hidden. The password is quite long but the box is very simple.", "Comcast were here at the stated time and performed a clean and efficient installation. They did not leave a mess and cleaned up after they were finished. There have been a few outages over the years but none that were extreme. I have not had to have Comcast come out for any problems but when I have to call they always make me go through the very basics of troubleshooting even after I have tried the usual steps. Their service is consistent and speeds are decent. We pay $79 per month for 25 Mbps download and 6 Mbps upload. I work from home full time and don't have issues sending large attachments.", "The tech was friendly and professional. They arrived on time and did what they had to do with the installation in a quick and timely manner. I also have had no customer service issues. They are always friendly and nice. They always take care of my needs quick and professional. Comcast has great service. It's reliable and never goes down. I can always count on it when I need it. It's fast and really nice. There are no service interruptions. I never have to wait for a page to load and I never have to worry about a page crashing in the middle of an important transaction.", "The tech was early and very professional. Also this person was easy to talk with and not stuck up like others. He did not give me any grief no matter how stupid my questions may have been. He explain everything in such a way that I could understand what is going on and what to expect from the entire process. For the most part the internet service is good but have to reset router about once a week because it shuts down out of nowhere. That's my biggest complaint about the service and product. But, when the internet is working the speed is awesome. Very few times does my videos have to buffer or I receive a lag time during my online gaming.", "They came and had all the services set up. The set up took less amount of time and there was no issue. The people were qualified and knew what needs to be done for what kind of set up. But they take too much time to send a CSR. They are known for being terrible. They have taken too much time to get the easiest things fixed but it should be easy and friendly. They must improve the customer service and make sure that they respond in time. This is the most important thing. Also, I feel it is more expensive than its value. I don't like some of the hidden costs. But excellent speeds and can be used on a lot of devices at the same time. This is the best service anyone can use. It is fun to use these speeds make it easier for everyone involved. It is ok but I am not satisfied.", "They show up in a timely fashion and guarantee it if they don't. Also, they install fast and explain everything. When I call customer service they are polite and understanding and they are friendly and capable. They answer fast, and if maintenance is needed they arrive on time. They answer all my questions and usually all issues are resolved within that phone conversation. When it comes to watching Netflix or downloading ebooks the speed is AWESOME. It takes seconds for the books and we are seconds to open Netflix and watch a movie. I love it!! I definitely recommend this company.", "The installation was scheduled at a certain time and wasn't performed Until later that evening Which of the technician found it was a bother to move or remove some Older wiring Two of the televisions When I hooked up right. And I had to wait 3 days Another technician to come out in Fix and repair. But the first technician should have done when he first got here but all & all it work out. The customer service representative and the two of talked to before that Was basically concerned with my issues, With my service or the lack of service that was provided to me During the installation. They took care of the Issue in a timely manner. With some over the phone Instructions that was easy to perform And checked and rechecked until the problem was solved. It was hassle-free.\r\n\r\nWill be on screen navigation to text your Issues Instead of waiting online long For an operator is a plus. Response time is quicker then has been set up an Xfinity remote is easy And quick And being able to talk to it really helps a lot. Haven't had much trouble with But the installation was Bothersome. But all in all I would recommend it to friends and Neighbors at this time. Slow web browsing And buffering is a thing of the past. But movies are easy to find for family, friends that come over & able to speak what movies is a big plus. Again the kids love it & when my fingers get tired I talk now that's progress.", "I am extremely happy with the speed of our provider. It is very fast. Multiple people can use it to stream movies, play Xbox or iPad or browse the Internet with no problems. The service very rarely goes down. When it does it is normally been our fault because it was unplugged or because we had a faulty splitter. The tech who install our equipment was very nice. There are a lot of wires that get in the way and it can be difficult to move or clean around. Customer service has always been wonderful. Most of our problems have been taken care of on the hotline. We did have to return one box but that all went very smooth.", "I had an easy installation process because they worked to find a time that was convenient for me so I would not have to alter my schedule in any way just to be there for the process of installing my internet service. I like that their customer service can be there around the clock to help solve any problems that may arise within my account at any time be it day or night. I also like that my internet service is reliable and that they are there to have my back when there is no weather issue that causes the internet to go down and they walk me through getting it back up again. But it rarely goes down and we rarely have connection problems compared to people with different internet service providers who continually have problems establishing an internet connection.", "Installation wasn't great and it was about what you'd expect but the tech who was coming to install was running late and wasn't the nicest person. He didn't communicate very well what he needed from me. It wasn't a bad experience, but it just could have been better. But with the internet itself, I always felt that my it would work, I never had to worry that it would run slow or stop working or cut out unexpectedly. Streaming also went really well with it. I never had to worry about Internet speed and I could always rely on it to run quickly. I could have multiple windows open, stream video, and have multiple devices using the Internet and it never ran slowly. Also, customer service was always super helpful. Whether by phone or by email, they always got back to me promptly if I ever had a question or concern. And when I was considering switching, they worked with me to create a better contract that would be affordable and for my needs.", "Easy to connect to and able to talk to real person, customer service representative was knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful. Didn't try to push more features on me unless I asked for them. Fast and efficient installation, representative was on time, friendly and professional. Excellent at explaining features and options that I had and more options that were available to be should I want them. Quality service, reliable with very few outages and fast speed for downloads and streaming. Available for multiple devices at the same time without slowing down access for any of the devices. The speed is all you need to do what you want, download speed is great, excellent streaming on video and music. Consistent speed, no buffering no matter the size of the files or video. Great for downloading games to gaming consoles and for playing games online.", "I have almost no complaints. The reliability is good. Although it sometimes has connection problems and it gets cut, but most of the time, everything works well. The speed is not the fastest, but it is not the slowest either. It has its ups and downs, but I am happy with the overall value of my internet service. Installation was very easy and fast to do. I did have a few questions so I called customer service and they were very helpful. I got my connection working in no time! I have called customer service 3 times and every time, they solved my issue to my complete satisfaction. Customer service personel is always friendly and helpful.", "Comcast offers great Wifi and it's reliable in so many ways. It does not take long to load when using wifi or cable like other services. I get to watch whatever I want on TV and if there's a problem then they have good customer service to get what you need fix. They even offer free wifi for an hour for people to see how they work. When I needed help on the phone, they were nice but it took a long time for them to get it right. They have very sweet people who help you with what you need. Customer service is excellent. They make sure their customers are pleased with their products.", "The Comcast installers showed up at the time appointed. They were friendly, helpful and answered all my questions about the dvr box and how it worked. They got the job done fast and didn't leave any mess But their internet service slows way down when trying to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu between 6 am to 10 pm. It keeps stopping or rebooting, last hours and it slows way down. Also, I call once about a bill but was on hold for over 45 min and the service rep was rude and did not want to fix the issue. When they finally found it was their mistake, it took 4 months and 2 more call to get my money back.", "We are subscribed to the Boost package and it is great. It allows us to have access to both types of internet connections that are commonly used on most devices. We can upload and download with ease. We watch movies via streaming services all the time with no problems. The internet service has been reliable with only 2 outages in 5 years. Able to run multiple devices at the same time on wifi with no issues. Much better service than the competitors for the money. They do not constantly increase the costs like the competitors do. Their costs are pretty steady over time, and we have had very little change in our bill in the past 5 years. \r\n\r\nThe installation was easy and came with great instructions. The difficulty was that we had an issue in the wiring on the outside of our building that a technician had to come out to find and repair. Once that was done, we had no other issues with the service. But Customer service is where Comcast stinks. Calling the 1-800# is like calling hell. However, they have recently made changes and you can now directly contact the local office for assistance which is much better. The local office agents are wonderful and helpful. I keep the local technical assistance and customer service numbers saved in my phone in case I need help.", "Comcast has consistent quality service with few if any service interruptions. They also provide pretty good speed for what you pay for. Web pages load pretty quickly and their quality of speed makes for streaming video content very pleasant with no skipping or interruptions. However, they have horrible customer service and are not very reliable for help when a problem arises. The customer service policies need to be completely overhauled and revamped. They are very rude and there have been many reports and recordings of their employees harassing customers and even refusing to cancel service when requested. I've yet to have a good experience with customer service. Other than that, this brand is very reliable. You also have the option of scheduling a serviceman to come to your home and install all necessary equipment for a fee or you can have the equipment mailed to your home and do the self-installation.", "Comcast has high speed internet which hardly ever has an outage. It's great for laptops and smartphones. I don't really have much that my internet service has to work with, but what I do have connects quickly and I'm able to go where I need to, without it taking forever to load a page, application, etc. Moreover, once I received the equipment it really took no time to set it up. I've only had a problem twice in my 4 years of having this service. The only problem is having to actually unplug the modem/WiFi to reset. Customer service representatives always take their time getting the information I need and always tries to assist you should you have a question about anything. They've removed charges that were erroneous, and have always acted like they cared to make sure my problem was definitely solved before disconnect.", "I was a Comcast customer for 40 years. The equipment was installed and remained at the same address in Hollywood, Florida. The billing address is in Brooklyn, New York and that has remained the same. My family and I are \u201csnowbirds\u201d. Recently I had to extend my \u201cseasonal hold\u201d to include the full 9 months allowed because of surgery. Apparently, it was not extended. But I had no way of know this because Comcast began sending bills to Hollywood, Fla. I could have questioned the incorrect charges had I received an invoice. Because of the Comcast mistake, eventually all services were disconnected, even those provided and paid for through my association. Comcast sent my account out to collection and included penalties for not returning the equipment on an account I never knew was cancelled. \r\n\r\nI was notified by a collection agency while in New York but Comcast had two different account numbers for me so I was unable to access the information. This was in November. When I arrived in December I was told the only way to restore the internet immediately was to put through a full payment. Within 5 days I would get credit for the false charges less the seasonal fee which I owed. I was told my association account for cable and Comcast account for internet had to be separated out by a specialist which would only be approved if I made full payment. These were the words of the billing office who assured me by providing a ticket number of the incident. I wasn\u2019t told the situation had to go before (the incompetent) Resolution Specialists in South Florida or I would never had made a payment. I was confident that a corporation such as yours was giving me valid information. \r\n\r\nFive days later, no credit and another ticket issued. I\u2019m still fighting this. South Florida specialists accused me of lying about the seasonal, lying about the error made in my mailing address (they didn\u2019t even check the records), said no one could give me a credit card refund and argued that seasonal was never allowed for 9 months. Supervisors I spoke with all had different versions of Comcast rules; many didn\u2019t have a clue and when asked to return the call I reached recordings and full mailboxes. This happened 9 times. I called Corporate PA who referred it back to Florida who repeated the same thing. They are not even aware that I returned all equipment 2 months ago. \r\n\r\nI am a handicapped 70 year old and more importantly a customer for 40 years. I was disrespected and disbelieved because I have no proof that I extended seasonal so I must be lying. My 20 year history shows I am in Hollywood maybe 1 month out of 18. Had I been in Florida as I originally planned I would have been without TV and internet until December. This makes no sense. Even when I call before arriving, as instructed, my seasonal is still on and my internet service isn\u2019t put back for 24-48 hours. This time I had a medical emergency and I needed access. That is the only reason I gave my credit card number. The representative also said if a refund couldn\u2019t be given on my American Express, would I accept a check. \r\n\r\nI agreed and asked that the mailing address be returned to the original in New York or I would never get the check. That was done and when the supervisor looked at my account he said I was not being truthful as my billing address was still New York. I am not trying to usurp your company, but I am asking for respect and a full investigation into my claim. Although I most certainly would value a refund more than a corporation with your earnings I wouldn\u2019t have exhausted all this time, energy and resources if it wasn\u2019t important that the truth be told. I feel so unfairly victimized. So I ask you, after you reach that corporate bottom line is there any room left for corporate responsibillity?", "I have been an on time paying customer of Comcast for about 2 years & then suddenly out of the blue they disconnect me without reason... I call customer service tonight (Sunday) & she can't give me the reason so she tells me to call a sales rep or tech tomorrow. Has anyone here ever experienced this or could provide info as to what's the possible reason for this?", "I've been a customer of Comcast/Xfinity for over 3 years now. I'm glad I made the switch from my previous provider. Comcast is very reliable, polite, professional and helpful. Combine this with the obvious and desired benefits of high speed and great quality service and anyone would be satisfied. The installation was a breeze. Their tech personnel came over and were done in less than 30 minutes, all for no charge. They even offered me upgrades every few months and a tech person to come out and help, if I needed (at no additional cost to me). However, upgrades were easy and I was able to do them myself - using the instructions they provided. \r\n\r\nI was also able to get reference material on their website to fine tune things. Never even needed to call in for help. It's been smooth sailing for over 3 years. In my region, they are clearly the best. Their staffers are polite and professional and know their stuff. They even helped me test speeds to optimize for performance in my area. I can check from time to time via a helpful tool if anything is remiss with speed, and it hasn't been.", "The installation process is extremely quick and the installers are fast to get to work. More work, less talk is the motto that I think of every time they come to install something for my television or something for the Internet. Comcast is reliable and frequently give me calls regarding problems that will occur in the next hour or so and they give me an explanation to why that problem happens unlike some of the companies I hired in the past. They also always give me insight on bills and always tell me when the bills are due. This gives me a schedule and pattern in which I can save money for a rainy day. \r\n\r\nThe Internet speed is extremely quick too and the staff are quick to inform their overseers about the problem or whatever about the problem, which gives me the satisfaction that I'm getting my money's worth and that's what I treasure about a good company. Getting my money's worth rather than \"funding\" a low budget leeching and very useless company. Additionally, their customer service is delightful! They are very helpful and if I have a problem, I can rely on them to fix my problem. They are quick to answer my calls, are quick to fix my problem and always give the option to leave the company.", "The installation was very fast. I directly talked to the technician and he came to install the internet in the timeframe we previously coordinated. He suggested me the best deal they had at that moment. The whole process lasted about 1 hour. I had Comcast provider for over 1 year. I had 2 outages in all that time, but they lasted few minutes. My service was a 75mg and I used it with all my devices at home (laptops, tablets, cellphones) up to 7 devices at the same time. Never had a big issue to complain about. The other positive factor Comcast provides is the numerous hotspots they have everywhere. I called them when I was planning to move and to ask if they had the service available in my new place. Sadly, they didn't so I requested the cancellation but the agent was friendly and helpful the whole time. So sad I had to change to Verizon.", "Installation is easy and I can save money by using my own modem/router by opting out of self installation. However, their customer service reps are under skilled for what they need to know, and the average wait time I have experienced is over 8 minutes, which is very discouraging to stay with their company for providing my internet services. Also, the instructions are unclear and language barriers are almost always very problematic in solving any issues I may have. Then I pay for the 2nd level of Internet speeds but my Internet is always going out when I am the only user on my modem. Sometimes devices can't even find the Wi-Fi network because the signal is so weak. Both the loading and downloading times are very slow and I am not wanting to pay even more money for terrible service.", "Comcast Internet Service is pretty good. It rarely ever is down and if it is, however, your tv probably is too. It is typically pretty quick however I still prefer to use my phone service. I feel the workers installed it perfectly. It works pretty damn good and I definitely recommend it. Their customer service are very easy to talk to. They do the best at their capabilities to help genuinely please the customer. They listen to your problems and do their best to solve. It is pretty quick speed, when very few people are on it. However there are times that my phone LTE speed is faster. I have also noticed it is faster at night.", "The internet service came during the appointed time and the service was done in a timely and efficient manner so I would recommend this provider. The speed of my wifi is very comparable to most internet services but I would love it to be even faster but I am not dissatisfied. I have never had any problems with the reliability of my internet provider. Occasionally my server will go down and I will have to reset my system but I do not feel that is my provider's problem.", "I haven't had any real problems with getting service installed. The installers are usually on time, and don't take all day to get it done. Our internet service works most of the time and when it does go down, it's usually down for some time, but at least it`s not too often. It rarely goes out for an extended amount of time. The speed is okay too and you get what you pay for. If you purchase 10 MBS speed, that's what you get, if you purchase higher speeds, you get faster speed. Also, when I did have to contact customer service, they usually can provide me with an answer to my problem, or tell me what is wrong, and when they hope to get it fixed.", "Comcast is a great company. They are very reliable and are good at fixing any problems you may have with their service or billing. I'd highly recommend them. I have used them for over seven years. The woman who came and installed the service was competent and friendly. She was on time and guided me step by step through the process and answered any questions I had. Their customer service is wonderful and answers my questions in a fast and timely manner and the wait time been no more than five to ten minutes. The internet speed is more than I could ask for. It is faster than any other internet I have ever used. There has only been one time when there was a lag in the service but it was handled promptly.", "Comcast's prices were great UP FRONT. There were very few interruptions in my service, no weather issues, not many glitches, variety of channels, wide selection on demand, always available. Also, the speed of connection was great, nothing took too long to load or download from any of our devices. However, it did seem a bit slow when it came to resetting the main box. When they installed they pulled insulation out of my walls but failed to clean it up, the tech smoked in my house, yes I smoke but very unprofessional to do so in a customer's house. When I tried to call to talk to them about the installation they seemed to sweep it under the rug as if it were no big deal which made me feel disrespected.", "Comcast was a great service provider. The internet and television service was as they offer. It was clear and fast. When I called they said they will be by on Friday in the morning at 9 am and they did come at 9 am just as they said and the installation was fast and simple. I liked the way they talk to me and their customer service is very polite. They made sure I understood everything from their services as the offer in the commercial said. Their speed is incredible. Every time I used my computer everything came out clear and in high speed. It was a service I enjoyed every time I used it day or night.", "Customer Service Operators were very helpful up to the point where they support the Company if you are being overcharged on your Monthly Statements. They always seem to treat each customer with the utmost disrespect by talking to us like everything always seems to be the Customers fault for everything. For the installation, I contacted Customer Service, have them a few numbers, and my internet was up and running. The second I installed the Router it was easy to connect my WiFi to my phone. High Speed Internet is exactly what you get, unless the Company throws a wrench at you by telling you that you never made a payment, even though the Customer has the Check information in their hand.", "NOT WORTH EVEN ONE STAR - How can we have a service company that does nothing but figure out how to charge you more and give you less or more of what you don't want. There is no such thing as customer or technical service. Now we are told we have a 'new and improved email\". BUT IT DOES NOT WORK. I have been reporting that my emails are not being received and still no response! There is no number to call or actual service email, just a community board with the wrong answers to your questions. And the answers are from 2012.\r\n\r\nI pay over $200 a month for this ridiculous Xfinity/Comcast (dis)service. When I first signed my current contract we could watch our programs on any of our devices. Now we are unable to watch any program as it airs. Currently I have not been able to get ALL my emails. Since I have two email addresses I have been testing my emails for the last three days from my husband's email and my friend's email. I get the emails from my Gmail account but not from my Comcast account. And the really irritating thing is that Xfinity/Comcast is a telecommunication company yet they NEVER send service outages or service update messages when they have all our email addresses. They only use our email to try to sell us more. SHAME on them!!!", "Constant problems with their equipment. I have seen my billing increase just about every month for the last 6 months. If it's not a regulatory fee, it's a sports franchise fee, and the list goes on and on. There have been dozens of times where the message \"We are having difficulty connecting to your entertainment experience\" appears on the screen, resulting in having to reboot their equipment.", "I had canceled my account and was ensured my next billing statement would reflect the changes that were made and no moneys were due since they charged one month in advance. The statement showed a $16.00 credit. I then called BoA to stop my auto payments. Two months later I had a bill for $38.00. I just called them and paid it. I won't ever use their service.", "Well from day one there were problems. Initial connection guy was vague and hurried with not a lot of explaining except where to hook up. Computers and tvs worked. Within hours internet was extremely slow!! Was on the phone for an hour and supposedly fixed. Next day computers slowed to nothing. Called back. Got better wifi. Next day computers froze. Comcast blames me. Dell and Samsung on hold for 2-3 hours. No help. Managers not available!!! Comcast. No longer available til 8 am. Would rather pay more for DirecTV than deal with this **!!!", "I tried to transfer my service to another address but they never sent out a tech and I paid for a extra month too and still no response. It's been a whole month. I want a refund. Please someone help me. I hate Xfinity!!!", "Sometimes the speed fluctuates and sometimes there are issues connecting, but overall the service is pretty reliable. Speed is normally pretty good but occasionally we will see a big reduction regardless of the number of connected device. We have no major concerns regarding the installation process of our high speed Internet. The time frame of installation is pretty wide and cause a person to lose a good sized portion of their day. But with regards to their customer service I have been lied to several times by Comcast agents who have promised to waive invalid fees only to receive the bill and see the commitments were not met.", "When I ordered my internet, the customer service team at Comcast was very helpful and nice. When I want to get my stuff for installation, they were very courteous and helpful. I self-installed the service at home and it's very easy and simple. The speed of the internet is the very best speed out there and it's great. It has never went out even during bad weather. I have 5 devices hooked up to it and it runs at top speed on all.", "Past internet providers have not been nearly as reliable as Comcast has been for me. The frequent times the internet has been down it has been caused by an outside source that Comcast has no control over. When Comcast first came into our area my family was experiencing numerous problems due to old wiring the previous company had refused to replace. After making Comcast aware of the problem they were quick to replace the old wiring both inside and outside our home. I've had very little experience with Comcast's customer service, which I consider a good thing as I was constantly on the phone with our old service provider due to numerous problems. After having our old wiring replaced, our internet speed was increased to a point that was amazing compared to our previous internet service.", "Services always randomly went out and mostly took a long time to fix. Internet speed is one of the few somewhat decent services Comcast/Xfinity has. Most of the time, the internet was pretty fast. But sometimes, it went horribly slow for no reason at all, and I know for a fact that many customers are NOT getting the speed they're paying for. They charge an arm and a leg for barely average service. \r\n\r\nComcast/Xfinity has always had one of the MOST horrible customer service centers ever! You spend a ridiculous amount of time on hold, just to be transferred multiple times to multiple departments. And half the time, you're \"disconnected\" and have to call back just to go through the entire thing over and over again, rarely getting any satisfactory solutions! Getting a reliable customer service member answer was almost nonexistent. Well, self-installation is easier than having a tech come out to install, although sometimes self-installation lacked clear instructions. When you use a tech for installation, they rarely ever show up at the promised appointment time!", "Quick installation and professional staff. They came within their timeframe and installed my modem quickly and no problems occurred. They answered any questions I had. Additionally, customer service always answered my questions promptly without problems. They are very friendly all the time and fix any issues that I had. I can always rely on my provider to do the things I count on them to do. The wireless service is always strong. I have never ran into any problems with the speed of my wireless Internet. Webpages always pull up in a promptly manner and downloads are very quickly. The bill is the same every month.", "The installation went smooth. The man who put it in was very kind and strong, was not scary and also helped walk me through everything I need to know so really overall it was a great experience. Customer service is the greatest. They are always on time and have always fullest prepared me, very polite and had a huge smile, very cooperative and nice. Help desk answers phone call right away and is always friendly and upfront with good answer to rely on. Internet speed was nice and fast, always up to par and could play all day everyday. I like to use bad websites and they load up perfectly. Also I like to run fast and things are loaded in no time when I go to download videos and projects. However, not good during thunderstorms. All you have to do is wait until it's over then you could start again.", "I called to have the service hooked up and there was a two-day wait period. There was no internet at our house before we moved in. They came to the house within the designated two-hour time frame and had it hooked up in about a half an hour. I have had no problems with the internet service. I live in a rural area, and there have been little to no outages. The bandwidth and the download time are good. The speed is great with the internet I have. I work from home at times and when the employer checks my specs the speed always passes their testing. Customer Service has been really good as well. If I need to call they are always very helpful and try to get the matter rectified in a short amount of time.", "It has been several years since I have had internet service installed. The gentleman that installed it was very knowledgeable and quick and I didn't have to wait too long for them to come and install it. Customer service is always right on point too. The staff seems very knowledgeable and willing to help you work through problems. I never hesitate to call when I need help and they've always resolved my issues in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nReliable service and many hotspots. I am always able to get on with little slow issues even though I have 2 teenagers that are streaming video and music regularly. Their internet service has actually gotten faster although my family is using more data. The only time I had issues was when they were working on updating the system in our area.", "The internet connection is fast but is really slow from 12pm-10pm. It's not very consistent on speeds. Shouldn't have to stay up all night just to use the internet. I love the high speeds if it stayed consistent, and if they offered dual or tri band routers. When speeds are high I get around 92 mbps, which is much faster than other companies. The installers added more lines instead of using previous Xfinity lines, and didn't run lines to all of rooms. It's much easier to do self installation. The customer service suck. They give you the runaround and charge you for things you don't have, and they won't fix bills.", "I've never had any issues with my internet. It has never disconnected, always a fast connection and very reliable. Sometimes if you are too far away from the modem the internet is just a tad slower but I have never had problems with my high speed internet being slow. I make YouTube videos so having high download and upload speeds is a must. I'm very satisfied with the speed.\r\n\r\nThe customer service is great and I have never had a bad experience. Call waiting time is short and the representatives are always very polite and professional. They always solve my issues and answer all my questions and concerns. The company also sends out a trained professional to help me. The installation personally took a while because I had not had internet or cable in a long time. The technician was very polite and professional as well. Before leaving he made sure I knew how to use all my devices.", "The company installed the internet service themselves and it was fast and simple with no problems. They gave me a low down on how to work it and the remote then left me to it. The customer service reps are super helpful if I ever had a problem. I was comfortable with knowing where to find help and how to get it and ask for it. It's very nice how they have done it. I have never had a problem with the connection and it giving out on me and compared to other internet service providers that is really good with the company's who have satellite dishes. It's the best speed and most fault of it is because of where I live but to have fast speeds you do need a lot of money to have it and a good house plus a good care provider.", "Installation was minimal and did not require a lot of work. Low wait times when you call into customer service. They were knowledgeable and friendly. If they could not help me, they promptly moved me onto someone that could. I am very happy with the speed. Uploads and downloads are much faster than what I have experienced with other ISPs. Great reliability and able to perform all needed activity without failures. Very little slowdown at busiest times of the day. Minimal at most of downtime or lag. I would recommend.", "The service is great and the customer service is good. They know what they are doing. They don't leave you on hold for a long time. If you have a question they know the answer. If they don't know the answer they get you right with someone who does. The installation experience was great. They were fast at what they did and they didn't leave a mess when they were done. They told me everything I needed to know about the service. My internet speed is nice and it works well for me. I am very happy with it so far.", "My internet service was already installed when I moved in. Just had to call to finish setup and it was simple. The internet service hardly ever goes out and as reliable as any other utility like gas and electricity. Expensive but good service and speed is great. However, customer service is not the best. It has improved over the years but still isn't the best in terms of trying to retain existing subscribers.", "The installment was pretty easy and fast. They got here and got to work. Had our service up and running in an hour. He was very polite and nice. He explain everything to us and how it work. Some customer service reps are good then you have some that are rude and act like they don't want to help you out. But overall their customer service is great. Every time I call they're always able to fix my problem with my service. Some days the internet can be very slow then some day where it fast as ever but overall the speed is up to my satisfaction and I'm happy with it. Overall it's a good company and they provide good services and they had wonderful deals. So I would recommend this service to you and family and friends.", "The installation guy knew what he was doing! He showed up on time, helped my parents get their tablets hooked up. He had to drill holes for the upstairs and did it quickly and without a fuss. He had us all set up within 45 minutes and left a card for any follow up questions. The customer service reps were more confusing than helpful. It was hard to understand them. It turned out they set up a primary email for me without giving me the password and then they couldn't help me because I didn't have the password. It was very frustrating. Though, they did help me with my problem and I didn't really have any more problems. \r\n\r\nMost of the time it worked fine. We didn't really have trouble when the picture was working, but heavy wind or rain can knock out service for hours. Usually when that happens, you can't get ahold of the company the rest of the day. The speed was decently fast, though there were times when it got bogged down. They were usually prime time hours, 5 to 8 in the evening, when everyone was getting home. We have two tablets and a laptop and we can all use them at the same time without any noticeable issues.", "We used them because there was literally no other option locally. It's not excellent, especially at peak times, but it's a lot better than dial up. It's reliable for the most part, but if something goes wrong the tier one and two techs are useless. They did a poor job with wiring on the outside of the house, which was split between us and an upstairs neighbor. I did the setup inside, because it was easier that way. We also had an issue that was on their end (someone switched off a node) and it took them 2 months to figure it out. Then they wanted to keep billing us for service we weren't receiving. It's very hard to get answers from them, they often don't know what they're doing. CS will drop calls and then you're back on hold until you talk to someone new who knows nothing about your previous call... And they interrogate you if you want to cancel.", "They have many different channels of customer service and support (online/telephone) and the reps are reliable, approachable and friendly. Issues and complaints and minimal outages are resolved quickly and efficiently. Comcast also has minimal installation requirements with low end charges. They have good equipment, skilled installation helpers and speedy support through helplines to resolve any further problems. And I get good download and upload speeds. Even during peak hours I'm able to view video content without any disruption or buffering issues. Average speed is high even with multiple simultaneous users.", "My parents recently and suddenly had to be moved into a nursing home. They were paying nearly $300 per month for Xfinity services, and the cancellation fee will be $650! If they had both passed away, there would be no cancellation fee. Ridiculous!!!", "I called in for internet service for my daughter through their internet essentials program. Comcast sent out a tech to install the modem. The tech move cords and wires that was surrounding and also attach to my tv. Later that day we came home and turn on the tv and it had a loud siren noise and a blue screen. I called comcast 4 times to file a claim. I was denied and was told I didnt have the correct date the tech came out and my story didnt add up. Like I was lying per Vanessa in claims. I am canceling my service with comcast. I pay my bills on time and have never filed a claim against them. I am so pissed off considering I had the incorrect date that's bs. I hope many people read this and take their business somewhere else. Comcast will definitely not get anymore money out of me.", "Ordered internet service for $49.95. Was convinced to take TV for a few dollars more with a 30 day money back guarantee. TV was not what was offered so I cancelled it. Now I have to pay $89.95 for internet because I cancelled the TV that was not what it was supposed to be. What a scam!!", "I originally selected self install, based on the recommendation of the field sales rep, who looked and said I would have no problem. The self-install did not work, so I was left having to pay for a professional installation. Every time I call customer service, I end up getting transferred. Even though I know the Xfinity phone system very well, and know which departments handle which issues, I ALWAYS get transferred. It lead me to having poor tv service for nearly 2 months, because I didn't want to have to deal with the phone reps. Once I get to an agent that is competent, then it's all good. I pay for 100 MBPS, but every time I run a speed test, I barely get above 50 MBPS. Service goes out frequently, but Comcast is the best option for where I live. We use a lot of devices wirelessly, 2 gaming systems, a laptop, and a cell phone, almost always all at the same time, so it can be hard to get them all to go at an acceptable speed.", "The speed is spotty at times, but overall dependable. We play games online and it is fast enough to be able to play competitively. It is fast enough for us, for now. I get frustrated with the signal sometimes. It can be buggy, but they usually fix it in a fair amount of time. I also have to watch my bill because I see mysterious charges that usually result in me having to make a phone call or actually go into the store. \r\n\r\nThen the installation had to be scheduled a couple weeks out, then they give you a 4 hour window where you have to sit and wait. But usually once they get there, it doesn't take long. Then the reps are very courteous and seemingly willing to help but it does seem like we frequently run in circles. We have had several extended phone calls investigating and disputing charges on our bill.", "The price of our internet service was acceptable and when I was streaming and or watching videos as well as movies, it worked well and never really had any issues and if there was an issue, it was solved. Contacting customer service to resolve any issues worked out perfectly fine and easy to correct the issues. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The quality of their service is up to par. The services was well worth it. While with other companies the installation was irritable, Comcast went well and pretty easy. I would totally recommend them to a majority of my friends and family.", "Comcast Internet Service has amazing quality and excellent customer service. The internet almost never goes offline and the internet speed is amazing. Webpages load almost instantaneously. The download and upload speeds are outstanding, incredibly fast, and efficient. I never have to wait long, even for really big files. I don't have to worry about lag and the speed really keeps up with me and my needs. I am not a patient person, and this internet really suits me. I guess it's left me pretty spoiled. I never have to worry about connectivity and I've only had to reset the router once in three years. I almost never have to call and speak to their customer service team and they've never had to send a technician out for a service call.\r\n\r\nFor the installation, they were able to send a technician out the next day. He arrived exactly on time, in the first 15 minutes of the anticipated installation window, and he was able to set up my cable and internet in less than a half an hour. He explained everything so it was easy to jump right into using the service and I didn't have to worry about anything.\r\n\r\nI've only had to speak with Customer Service twice, and one of the times was my first call to actually sign up for the service. They're incredibly polite, friendly, and professional. The process is quick and they don't overwhelm you or bog you down with too much information. They aren't pushy and they really know how to put you at ease.", "There is very low wait times when calling and the reps are very friendly and work hard to ensure that customers are happy and get what they want. They send techs out when needed. However, service people are not always very professional. The tech was late, but very good once started. He was very thorough and answered all of our questions. He even took the time to show us extra options. The internet service is not ever interrupted but it is slow even though we pay for higher speed. We have had to upgrade several times and pay more and more money in order to get a speed that will work for our family. Still, it is still slow even at higher levels.", "The installation process was pretty fast and on time. The guy check in with us; letting us know what we were getting and what he'd be doing. Once he was all done, he was nice enough to show us how the cable worked and answered questions we had! He was very professional!! Internet speed is great. Even when all of us are busy with our laptops or cellphone and iPads, we're all able to use the internet without worrying it will slow down on us. But we all have those days that we can't get anything to work!! The idea of making a phone call to customer service is scary but sometimes it's just needed. But what's great about Xfinity is before doing all that, they offer an app to give you help and support when you need it. And if I can't do it, I'm happy to call. My brother and I have never had a problem. I know I'll be helped as quickly as possible!", "Most of the time I get the down- and upload speeds I pay for. I have had to call monthly, sometimes more than once a month, for troubleshooting but the service itself is really very reliable and tech support by phone or in home has been great. However, there is no such thing as customer service at CONcast. I have even gone to the local payment center for help with my billing concerns and have been told that if I want to see someone who was empowered to help me, I would need to drive an hour and a half from home without guarantees that I would be helped. Then the technical and physical aspects of the installation were perfect however the install tech lied about the work that he did in order to pad his paycheck and I was charged an additional $90 for work that was neither needed nor completed. To date these fraudulent charges have not been removed from my account. Customer service and billing have been disgraceful.", "The installers did a very good job but had to drill a lot of holes in my house to accommodate for all my TVs and phone and internet. The tech was very good otherwise. I have had no problems with the internet service too even in bad weather or storms in the past year or so, that goes for my cable and home phone also. My internet speed is fast and has a very good connection. Also, anytime I have a issue with my service when I call or go online their customer service take care of the problem very quickly. I would highly recommend Comcast to everyone who needs a faster internet connection.", "My internet has never crashed and it is super fast! Numerous people can be at my house and be on the internet and not have lagging or slower service. The speed is consistent and I have no problems with my internet whatsoever. The man that came to set it all up for us walked us through what he needed to do for installation. He did it in a very timely manner and was able to answer and explain any questions we had for him. He was very friendly and cautious about his work. He also knew what he was doing and he did an amazing job. Any questions we have get answered by customer service in a timely manner. We do not have to sit on the phone for a long time waiting to talk to someone. When we would explain our problem or ask questions the worker knew exactly what was going on and was very knowledgeable in their field.", "The installers were on time, they installed and explained everything clearly with numbers to contact if we had any issues. The technicians were polite and knowledgeable about their service, and answered all my questions clearly. However, we are paying for high speed, up to 75, but never seem to be able to hit 25 and we have to call at least once a month because our \"high\" speed connectivity never goes over it. We get a lot of error loading messages, and dropped connections. However it runs steady around 13, and when it goes lower we have to call because pages won't load. But every time we have had to call, the representatives are always helpful, polite and willing to go above and beyond to help fix any problems. They seem to sincerely want to help, and are happy to do what they can to help fix things that go wrong.", "It's convenient and most of the time the speed was extremely fast and reliable. Also, it was easy to set up an appointment on the phone for the installation. They came when they said they would and it didn't take long. The guy who came was very nice. They installed it and showed how to use it. And the reps always come to help you if you need it and are always available to talk to you on the phone. They always reach out to you even if they don't ask and send flyers with coupons. We rarely have problems but Comcast can sometimes be a little slow when you are using the internet too much.", "I was satisfied with the installation. The technician was very professional, easy to understand, and explained the whole process to me, and how long it would take. My internet service's reliability was ok and I didn't have to worry about losing my connection. I was happy with the service speed and very dependable service. They offer different service speed packages if you need more speed. I just don't like the prices. Still, I think the customer service was good because the technicians know what is going on and the operators are knowledgeable as well. I don't have any problems when I ask questions about my service.", "Xfinity is a reliable internet provider. I have no issues with my service or speed not being up to my standards. The only time I have any problems is when I lose my power altogether. The speed of my internet connection is very fast. Even when I'm using my 3g phone I do not have any problems with the speed of my internet connection. The tech who installed my internet was on time and made sure that I understood not only the setup of my tv but also walked me through how to use the remote functions and etc. The customer service reps are very courteous and professional. They are very helpful with any problems you may experience should any problems come up. They will try to solve your issues without having an actual tech out which could cost you more money.", "The installation process was very easy. The customer service was always very helpful and friendly and was there when I needed help with installation and the provider going down for a moment in time. The speed was very fast comparing to other internet providers that I had used in the past and I will always except speed as fast as this provider. The service always worked when I needed it to and the few times it didn't I got help from those that work for the provider and got it back up working very quickly.", "We've been having problems with the wifi for over a year. We have called numerous times. They have us get our computer out and sit on the phone and test it. It shows the connection is weak yet no one has come out to fix it. We also have not received any compensation for barely having wifi connection. I don't even bother to go on my computer because I spend so much time waiting for pages to load. I use my cell phone if I want to look anything up on the internet. I feel their prices for what they offer, are outrageously over priced. It's hard to be satisfied when you've barely had wifi for over a year that you pay and arm and a leg for. But the installers that came to set up the internet were very friendly and efficient. They were in and out, which we loved. No one wants a stranger in their house all day.", "The internet provider and the service are exceptional. When scheduling an appointment, they were on time and fast. The installation process was fast. I was able to schedule an appointment within 72 hours of making it. The driver called when he was on his way and then called 5 minutes before they got here. They offer fiber connections which make the speed faster than copper wire. It all depends on the speed chosen. Customer Service did not explain or ask the right questions to determine which speed was best for me and my needs, but once I figured it out it was great. The Technical Service Department is wonderful, however the Billing Department people are not the nicest people and the Customer Service people are very rude.", "I called and ask them to come out for installation of Television, Internet, and phone service. I thought they would come out the following week to do the installation. The Rep ask me to hold on and allow her to check something. She surprised me and said how about eleven o'clock a.m.. I ask when. She laugh and said tomorrow. Excited I said yes, and he was here fifteen minutes early, and was finished with everything in forty five minutes. Their customer service is awesome. They care for their customers to the fullest. When you need them the most especially when trouble arrives, they are willing to help to resolve any issues you have with their service. I was shocked when one day, I believe it was the first of this year they came and put in new cable lines on our home, without us asking.\r\n\r\nComcast is reliable. If you have a problem with your Internet connection using their modem, they will walk you thru modem if needed by the steps to resolve the issue. After walking their customer through the troubleshoot, and you still have a problem, they will try to fix it from their location, like using a remote connect, or send a signal to your modems. If by chance that do not work they will send out a Technician to the home, usually the next day. They even provide a new unused modem. I am on Broadband, but the speed could be better, but I am satisfied because they are a leader in their field. They are now trying to resolve our internet speed. Right now I am happy because I still can use my internet connection.", "I would give negative stars if it was possible!!?? I have had a problem with billing for over 6 months, and I'm still not sure if the problem is corrected. My bill would state I had a credit, (like I was supposed to have) yet my bank account would still have an automatic debit. Every month when I call, I get a new ticket number to investigate the situation since no one would know what the pending credit was for. It didn't matter how far up I would get transferred, they would not be able to help me. The credit was for equipment I didn't have that Comcast was charging me for. I had the ticket number for that investigation but all they could do is see that number and give me yet another ticket number. I will be waiting for a check in the mail at this point, which is actually more than my monthly bill is, so hopefully I will not have to speak with these unhelpful people next month! Such a waste of hours on something that shouldn't have been to begin with.", "$75 for 25 mbps for a single line internet service!? Then you spend 20 minutes on the phone while they try to sell you a house phone, cable TV, and internet package!! I went in to pay my bill and saw $44/mo go up to a $74/mo bill!! A single line to accommodate my 1 laptop device. I don't need a home phone, I have Dish Network ($35/mo), thank God!! And my Verizon cell never fails me no matter where I go, that bill is $77/mo and it does everything I need.", "Installation was easy and fast with nice and helpful worker. Only wished the service was good and worked. Never had a problem with other internet service before until them. Always lost signal and customer services was no help at all. They didn't seem to know what they were doing at all and pretty rude. I would get transfer over and over, they would not returned calls and overcharged me a lot hidden fees. Not worth it. Never worked, never got money back for something we didn't use. When I had signal it was so slow and frustrating. Bad experience for me with this company.", "Comcast went above and beyond to get me hooked up. The apartment I lived in needed all new wiring and they made several trips to my apartment to make sure they got it working properly. The installation was very good and the installer was very nice and understanding. Also, whenever I had to call customer service they were all very nice and courteous. I had to call many times because the apartment I lived in wouldn't let them run the new wiring. They got everything straightened out and was very understanding about it. The internet never went out too and the speed was a lot better then what I have. Now I could play all my games without lagging and I could download pretty fast as well. We ran two computers and my phone and it never slowed down.", "Comcast's installation was quick and easy, and the technician came out quickly. This was a seamless transition from my prior service. This is a good service with few outages, the speed is fast, and great for streaming and downloading. I could not be happier with the speed, it serves all my needs for internet surfing and downloading. Also, the price is reasonable, and customer service is always helpful. The customer service department is easy to access, they are friendly and resolve issues quickly. I have had only good experiences with customer service. I would recommend this service.", "Comcast is excellent and reliable service provider. The installation was easy and very fast. I can do myself and if you get some problems you can contact the technical support and will received a good and quality support. It's prompt and reliable. The customer service is great. It's easy to reach and can resolve the problems in the fast and effective way. They have a very qualified personnel who can help a lot. The speed is fast and I cannot complained about it.", "The installation was very simple. I had the boxes delivered to my house. You can have someone install them for you if you want but doing it yourself is easier. My internet is very fast, incredible. It's great. I can download something and it doesn't take that long. I love it!!! Sometimes it's slow though and there's problems with it but other than that it's perfect and amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants fast, affordable internet. However, the few times I contacted customer service they were very rude and hung up on me multiple times. It took forever to get through to someone and when I did they hung up.", "The installer was very knowledgeable and nice. He was able to have the Internet, and accessories, installed within forty-five minutes. Once finished, he gave me a 'how-to' on my new service. I can only think of one time I couldn't get my browser to connect to the Internet, and it was because a storm. Once the storm started to settle down, I was able to reboot my router, and it started right up. I was very happy with the speed of my Internet connection. I've had several different internet providers in the past, but this was the only service that actually was able to consistently provide me with the speed I was paying for.", "The technician was late for the installation. Then he knocked on my screen door very lightly and left without even trying. I was only a few feet away. I don't even know if he really knocked cause I am pretty sure I would have heard it. The speed of the internet worked very well. It was fast and accurate but hard to afford on a budget. Even though I never had any issues with the service itself, every month the price went up. They were not willing to work with us and there always seemed to be some hidden charges. They would rather shut your service off than to work with you. The operator was not very polite even though I have never been late on my bill before.", "Speed is ok most of the time. Ours is 25 mbps and I don't have the really fast internet. We can only use 2 devices at one time without really bad lock up and lag. Then We lose internet access 2 to 3 or more times per week. It's also so expensive they could do better. Then Sometimes when we stream movies they lag so much we just quit watching. When we first obtained internet, the service tech, who was local, spent several hours making sure it worked correctly. He went way beyond what we expected. But when we have a problem, and call customer service, we always get someone from another country. It's hard to explain what the problem is and impossible to understand what they are telling you to do to correct the problem. And you have to be the one to correct the problem.", "The speed was pretty good sometimes but it seemed as people got home from work or children got on in every evening it slowed or didn't work. And every time we had bad weather we lost connection, they claimed it was because of the water or satellite signal loss. Never received comp on our billing. They never discovered a problem if they did come but our provider now said bad wiring was used and the line was not ran correctly. Most of the time it took days to get them here. If you call customer service it was usually the same response of, \"I'm sorry a service person will get to you.\" If you ask for a supervisor you were just left on hold and no one answered or you were hung up on.", "Overall great service. Although sometimes hard to reach an actual person when calling customer service for support but once getting to someone it was smooth sailing. They're very polite and to the point usually without having to put me back on hold. The installer was nice and informative. They got there on time with a call ahead and had it done quickly. Getting them back out there for any problems was a little harder. Most of the time I am very pleased with the speed of the internet. However, the weather has an affect on service every now and then but problem is usually resolved in a timely manner.", "The installation was easy self-explanatory and Comcast also sent a guide to show you exactly how to do it yourself. If you had any concerns there was a number you could call. The customer service was great. They started you off with an automated help so you weren't having to wait for a person and 9 out of 10 times they solved my problem that way. The service reliability was great, wasn't slowed down when downloading movies or when multiple people were using it. No interruptions, no problem streaming videos or playing games and the wireless stretched fast. The speed is awesome.", "I hate COMCAST and their useless customer support agents. I love how they want to charge you to send out a technician to troubleshoot their crappy, unreliable equipment.", "I was convince to sign a 2 year contract with Comcast by sales agents that visited my home. I was promised unlimited internet. After a few months I started getting overcharged and was told I do not have unlimited internet. Two employees told me it was removed. I was told it would cost me $142 to get out of the contract. I made my complaint many times about the scam of a contract I signed and nothing was fixed. In May 2017 I was overcharged $120. My bill was $326. After many agents later, one told me everything would get fixed. I was to pay $25 extra every month and receive unlimited internet again. The fee for May would be waived and June's bill. This was a LIE again. I never got the $120 refund and my bill for June was $110 more than the usually. \r\n\r\nAgain I took the phone, everyone kept promising to help but hung up on me or transferred me to other agents. Hours of my time wasted as each agent took 30-40 mins asking about the issue. After reporting the company, someone from corporate contacted me offering me half of the money. After explaining my frustration of the lies that convinced me to sign the contract. Theo said he would review the phone call and see because I told him I wanted the entire refund of $230. He said he would call back in one day and never did. \r\n\r\nI reported the company again. Another corporate employee called me and refused to give me a full refund. She dismissed my complaint and said I can only get back $120 because I used the data and tried saying I should not even get back any money that it was a courtesy. She was dismissive and rude. Comcast is the worst company I've ever accepted service from. IT'S not a courtesy to lie to people and take their money then overcharge them. It's called not being a con artist Comcast. I took this issue to social media and others are experiencing the same thing. I hope this company goes out of business soon!", "The person who installed my service was on time, friendly and knowledgeable about the products. He explained the features and ensured that everything worked properly before leaving. Customer service is also open twenty-four hours and are always friendly and willing to help. Each time I have called, my issue or request was handled quickly and professionally. The service is speedy which is very important to my family. We use the service for a multitude of things including for work and school so high speed connection is a must. My internet service is very reliable for the most part, however I seem to have to reboot my system often and the reboot process takes too long.", "My internet service has been on and ready for me to use whenever I need it. I never have to reset my modem nor do I experience any unexpected outages. The speed/connect is great too. My installation was a little tricky, I had received a self-installation kit and I had trouble with installing it. I eventually had to get a tech to come and set up my service. I haven't had any problems since then. I know that there are faster speeds around, but I'm ok with the internet speed I have... No issues with me. I am completely satisfied with Customer Service, I have never had a bad experience with them. The operators over the phone and the technicians that have come to my house... they must have a good training program because I always have great service.", "Reliability of my high speed network connection is extremely good and rarely it ever goes out. About the only time there is an interruption in service would be when the electricity is out and of course that disrupts everything. I pay for the 105 high speed internet and 90% of the time that is the speed that I have. There is slowdown on holidays and during nights like presidential debates. The Slowdown is serious enough to interfere with streaming video.\r\n\r\nThe best provider who installed my product was an independent contractor. He was willing to do some rewiring at my house and set up my modem and router without any extra charge. He was not a regular Comcast employee. Customer Service for Comcast is extremely rude and if you call with a problem all they try to do is sell you more stuff without really listening to your service problems.", "The initial costs of installations seem really steep, but no real other choice. The installations have always been quick and done by knowledgeable professionals. Also, I've had nothing but the absolute best when it comes to Comcast customer service. Any and all issues have been handled very quickly and in expert manner. My only complaints are cost of the service and speed bogs that seem to happen in the late evenings. The speed is awesome during from morning to early afternoon, I really notice the difference when watching streams. But other than those two issues I'm fairly satisfied.", "The installation was easy. It was the after part that was not great but the tech people were very nice and helpful while setting up the service. All cable companies have some level or distrust from all people but they take forever to talk to someone and they always try to get you to fix the problem yourself before they send someone who is never on time. Also, the speed was okay when it was actually working but a lot of times I just had issues with the service itself so still not fully satisfied and that is why I don't use them anymore. So the service was not reliable or definitely not like the service I have now that's for sure.", "The Comcast installer was quick, very polite, explained everything clearly, showed me how to hook everything up, and how to reset if I ever had a problem. The overall speed is amazing. I work from home and am able to download multiple projects at the same time. We have some outage problems sometimes and the \r\ncustomer service is great. Every time I have had to call for a maintenance issue or a billing issue, customer service has been extremely helpful and polite, problem was always resolved within minutes. The cost is very competitive too. I would definitely recommend them.", "Sometimes they would help but other times they wouldn't so Comcast Internet Service was average. It just depends on who you're talking to. They were alright. The guy knew what he was doing and once he got it installed it worked perfectly fine. Also, the speed right now is great. Very little lag and always is working. Hasn't dropped in a very long time so I'd recommend it to someone looking for Internet.", "The speed is adequate for what we use it for. They have better options available, but we really mostly just surf the web and sometimes stream Netflix or play Minecraft, and it's adequate for that 90% of the time. Occasionally the internet is slow or has issues, but this is usually fixed by resetting the router. Installation was fast and easy. We didn't even have to have someone come out to the house, just plugged everything in and the people over the phone talked me through it. It was quick and painless and worked right away. Customer service has always been polite and helpful. For some reason they have had my name spelled wrong on the bill for like a year and I've given up trying to fix it, but that's a pretty pointless issue and they've always solved any other issue right away.", "Installation is normally flipping a switch and then dealing with support to actually turn on your service. Also there are transfer fees if moving and a repeat customer. Agents on the phone are typical at best, maybe annoyed or often times rude and condescending. It really depends on day or agent. What more can you say other than minimum wage employees who dislike their job? All around Comcast's service was okay, but overpriced for the up speed and down was good during off-peak hours and assuming you are not being throttled to crippling dial up speeds for using their service, web TV and video games only are enough for them cap you. For the most part it was on, but with standard outages, AM outage, PM bandwidth issues, occasional one day off outages with occasional drops in service randomly.", "When we first had our services installed it was quick and easy. The only thing I wish was different is the waiting period to begin services. But Comcast has been a decent internet provider for my family and we have had very little problems with the Wi-fi and we have experienced decent customer service. Even when our service has gone out it has quickly been resolved. I have had great customer service. For example tonight I had an issue with our cable and I called Comcast and it was fixed very quickly. When we have had issues with our box or internet or even our bill they have been courteous in going over it. Also, our internet speed is quicker than our phones. I love the wi-fi connection and I love that it works almost always.", "Comcast Internet Service were installed pretty quickly. They were very easy to deal with on that part. However, it is not reliable or helpful. Our cable would go out often, internet would often freeze up or be super slow and it would take too long to load up websites. It was ridiculous. Their customer service is not helpful at all. They did not listen to our complaints or try and help when we needed them to or reimburse us for time lost. Also, they're way too expensive. Never any discounts or special offers.", "Comcast has very great service. It always has a strong signal and the speed is great. I never had a problem with it even when the weather is bad. If you don't have money on time they are cool enough to gave a grace period to pay it. That's very reliable of a service provider. But they did a sucky job at installing everything. It's just everywhere so I would do it myself next time. Comcast needs better people to do installation. The customer service reps are very rude so I would rather talk to a automated service than deal with them who are supposed to be nice and respectful.", "I wanted to install the product myself which they give you the option of doing. A technician ended up coming out and he was on time. He installed my service pretty quickly and even recommended that I get an extender to expand my wifi range. However, customer service needs some work. I had an issue with my billing once and I ended up talking to five different people who each had a different take on my problem. Communication within customer service is beyond terrible. Nevertheless, the speed is super fast! The service allows me to stream seamlessly as well as get to websites that I need to get to with no problem at all and I also get access to the Xfinity site with a lot of my favorite shows and movies. I also got the option of using my own modem as well which saved me money. I just wish the product itself had more range to get to all products that I connect online within my home.", "It didn't take long for them to install it and they showed us how everything works. They're on time and professional. The customer service has gotten better over the years. More reliable and don't leave you on the phone waiting on hold like they used to do. Speed is gotten a lot better. I can download files faster. It's good for work and for watching videos. Internet doesn't go out too much so it's pretty reliable. And when it does go out they call you to let you know how long it's going to be out. Thank you.", "Everything I didn't understand about service was explained during installation. By the time it was done I had no questions. Installer worked expertly and was quite knowledgeable about my services. Service is exactly how I expect it. I'm satisfied with my service and feel like it's always there for me. My wireless service is also great. I use my internet for pleasure more than work... but loading music and video always less and less time. Speed is just right and always what I expect and I'm never disappointed. Customer service calls, though rare are always handled quickly. CSRs are well trained and able to help fast and happily. It seems like a great work environment.", "I enjoy my Comcast internet service a lot and absolutely love having it. It always works. I can always count on it to work for me. I have never had any problems with it going out during storm and bad weather. Furthermore, it always goes fast for me. I have never had any issues with it running slow. Another big problem that always happened with my old was it going out at least ten times a day. This wasn't, even once. The installation was very fast and easy. Most take all day but this was only about an hour before it was set up and ready to use. It didn't take all day or confuse me. I never worried when I have to call. I have only called twice but they were always so kind and helpful to me. I always get someone on the line fast and don't have to sit there and wait all day. I love that about them.", "The internet installation went smoothly although it took a bit longer than I would have thought. The serviceman was very friendly too however I would have rather scheduled an installation time rather than been given a window. So far, we have only lost connection 2 or 3 times in 2 years and it was an easy fix. Every once in a while internet will be a tad slow however it usually only lasts a minute or two. I also haven't never had any problems with speed and I don't usually have to wait for anything to load. The two or three times I have had to chat with customer service have been fairly easy. I was able to talk to an actual person and they were able to answer my questions quickly and efficiently.", "Sometimes the Comcast Internet Service works perfectly but sometimes it crash or goes really slow. But overall it comes in handy when you are bored and have nothing else to do. Overall the speed of my internet service is wonderful. Videos don't take long to load, the kids can do their homework and complete it. Television works fine and my husband loves it. During installation, they destroyed a few household items and furniture wires were everywhere. They tracked mud all through the home and left it like that. But customer service was okay. They listen to your problem and work very hard to fix it. They are polite and speak clearly. When I call them, it's never a fail.", "Always fast reliable service and friendly personnel. I'm happy with internet speeds and the variety of cable channels. In fact, Internet speeds are some of the fastest where I live. And sufficient for all of my Internet and cable needs. Recently Comcast gave me a new modem and it is the fastest most reliable experience I've had. The customer service personnel are friendly, fast, courteous and willing to help with whatever need I have. Installation was fast and all of the workers were friendly and courteous. You'd be amazed how quickly technicians will come to your door and help you with whatever you need. I would recommend Comcast to anyone who is looking for an Internet and cable solution.", "I wasn't around for the installation but since it still works I know it was successful. The equipment has been reliable and I get high speed downloads. Very fast, it goes around 17 Mbps with the speed test. Much higher than the other options around here. I can download a 5 GB package within an 30 minutes. Also, the internet has only gone out once in 2 years. The customer service is quick. There aren't long waiting times, you call them and get a representative fast. If you need them to come out to fix something, they schedule you in after a few days of the call. They respond on site and get the job done.", "The installation was very simple, they were in the house for like an hour which compared to other companies is like half the time but there was already cords hooked up. The speed quality of our internet has been good. I haven't had any issues uploading videos or playing games where I had had these problems with my last internet provider. In my opinion, it is a reliable service compared to other providers that don't stay active as well.", "Initial installation was quick and uneventful. When Comcast is looking for new customers they bend over backwards to sign you up. Once they reel you in and you experience any problems, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. I pay for the premium speed called \"Blast\". It is extremely slow and more often than not you can't connect to the internet. I call and all I'm told is that we just sent a \"signal\" to your modem. I call and it takes an eternity to reach a human being. Then I am told a number of different things that I need to do to fix the issue and that takes up a lot of time. Eventually a repair person will come to my house. Pure and utter incompetence and stupidity. Call for service and you explain the situation and after the \"Call Center\" tells the customer how to fix the problem, invariably a repair person is sent to your home.", "My system was set up properly but I later experience problems on a monthly basis. Sometimes it shuts down and is harder to bring up. I have to wait too long for the system to come up and have to turn off my computer and start over. Changing applications also takes too long. I have called customer service and told them about this problem. But recently I had to call several times before I could speak to someone to fix the service and it is difficult to get someone who understands the system. The service is not good. I have had service rep to hang up and not call back. Some have given wrong information and billing problems are a monthly hassle. I have been billed for items not ordered.", "I would recommend this service to anyone who wants internet service. Xfinity is really good to use for anyone who wants it and it's awesome. Also, it's easy and fast to install and it's very simple... it takes about 10 minutes and anyone should be able to do it. The customer service was very good. I'm very happy with my internet service because it's easy and fast to use. My favorite is the speed and it takes about 10 minutes and someone is always helping you out with it.", "1) Lengthy service outages. 2) Online \"fixes\" are menu-driven and set up so that the online process always says the problem was fixed even when it wasn't. 3) Current efforts to get to the bottom of a 4.5 hour (and counting) Internet outage include 3 phone calls (where the service rep said the problem would be resolved by a certain time and then it wasn't) plus 5 online \"fixes\" that didn't fix anything and one phone call to try to get the company to subtract usage time from my bill (but the rep made no guarantees whatsoever). 4) From what I can tell, repair service for individual accounts do not work.", "When it is working our speed is fast. However it often does not work. Our signal is weak even though it says it's at full strength and strong. We had to buy an extender and just to be able to go to the Next Room. Service is terrible. We were supposed to be given free installation however the guy who came was very rude and made a mess in our home. Did not clean up the wood shavings he left from drilling. They were late. They say in their commercials that if they're late they give you a $20 bill credit. We they complain about them being late and receive nothing barely even an apology. Service is terrible and the people have been rude and unhelpful.", "The speed of service is unmatched. Connectivity was great whenever I needed it. I can always connect without any disruptions and work for hours on end. They always beat the competition. Customer service reps are always quick and willing to help and are extremely courteous. They are friendly and get your issue solved whether it be day or night. They have fast and friendly techs, too. Always on time and take the time to finish the job to the customer's satisfaction. I highly recommend Comcast.", "The tech came during the service window and set up everything. He got the tv, internet, and phone working with no problem. He was very professional and courteous. However, customer service is terrible. I've had Comcast/Xfinity for over a decade, and I've always had to wait on the phone for assistance, no matter what time of the day or night that I called. I've had appointments cancelled without notice. I've had techs make me wait all day. It's ridiculous. As for the speed, it's acceptable. They only guarantee the speed over the line and not through the air, so if you want their top speeds, make sure you get the modem near your computer so that you can wire it. It works great when it works. Unfortunately, I've had two modems in two years. My internet and telephone come through the same modem, so when it is down, my phone doesn't work either.", "The reliability of the service was very good. We did not experience any real issues with outages or disruption. The speed is very fast which is fantastic. We do a ton of streaming for movies and music and there seems to be no real interruption or glitches. The install tech said that they would arrive during a certain window and were mostly prompt. The tech was very courteous and knowledgeable and there were no issues in installing the service. The customer service was generally pretty good. However, there were times that it took a long time to get through and the problem was not solved in a satisfactory time.", "I have good results with this service. There are occasionally hiccups, but nothing that hinders my enjoyment of the experience. I want to continue using it for the foreseeable future. I'm happy with the speed of the service. It's hard to believe how far we've come from the dial-up modem to where we are today. I'd be hard-pressed to want or need higher speed. The installation of this service was very good. It was seamless and easy enough that I don't even remember doing it. To me, that's a sign of how good the experience was. I don't need customer service very often but when I do need help the representatives are friendly and helpful. I've generally been able to solve issues with the first call.", "I recommend Comcast internet, phone, and TV service. They will do a good job installing it. The wifey and kids will really love you. Believe that. When it rains I can still look at the t.v. without any problems from any other weather problem. The internet service works. Really good endurance and tough and fast service. Their customer service is also really good.", "Getting properly set up took a couple of extra visits. Service was slow at first, and had to have 2 different technicians come out to inspect. Once wiring problem was finally discovered and corrected, everything went smoothly. We have good coverage in our local area and Comcast has generally reliable internet service. There are some hang ups during storms and heavy usage throughout the home, though. My husband always believed that service slowed down when we streamed movies too often. But we used multiple devices at the same time without problem. All in all there were not many problems in the 3 years we had service with Comcast. On the occasions that I contacted customer service, I found the wait to speak to someone to be long, but the agents were friendly and helpful. Customer service follow-up was also nice.", "Comcast had the worst customer service that I have experienced. The agents were always rude and never took responsibility for Comcast's mistakes whether it be billing or equipment issues. The installer, though he was relatively new to Comcast, was knowledgeable about the equipment he was installing. However, he spent quite a bit of time bad mouthing our previous internet provider since he used to work for them in the past. The Comcast internet service was very spotty and the quality of the internet was terrible. It was so slow and the equipment was often faulty. I ended up switching because the problems were consistent. But when the internet actually worked it was quick and responsive which was about the only thing positive about the company.", "Installers were quick and friendly. They came at the time they had promised and finished in a quick fashion. They were very knowledgeable in their jobs. Comcast internet is pretty decent compared to everything else and I really never had a problem trying to watch content or play games. It's efficient when I really needed to get something done.\r\n\r\nComcast was always there to help if there was a problem. They are very friendly and customer oriented. It's super easy to reach someone when I had an issue and there are pretty short wait times on the phone. When I had a question it was a pretty easy process to get it solved. Customer service is normally able to fix problem over the phone but also always came out within 24 hours to fix what they needed to.", "The tech was super nice and helpful during the installation. He walked me through every part of the process and made sure I understood what he was doing and why, also that I knew how to use the service. The customer service I've received has been great. I only had one issue and it was resolved quickly, the customer service rep was knowledgeable and helpful. Comcast is the fastest internet and the speed is unmatched by any company around. It doesn't matter if its rain or shine, I never have any issues with my connectivity. Along with the customer service, it was a home run purchase. I couldn't be happier.", "The service often went out, poor signal, not very fast, often lagged and slow to load even small web pages. Downloads took a long time and often crashed midway through. Streaming video is often slow and interrupted by buffering. During any bad weather it would lose the signal and take several hours to be fixed. The installation was not bad though. It was fast and they had courteous technicians. The equipment was small and fit easily where I needed it placed. Minimal use of long wires and it reached the rooms I needed. Their customer service is fast to respond and send techs out, quickly replaced any faulty equipment. The charges were a bit high for my liking, but they did offer occasional coupons.", "The installation was so easy and quick and they were here and gone. The tech was friendly and even explained to my kids what he was doing. Their service is easy to use, and their speed was comparable to other companies. They also offered to put in a booster to make sure I got all the speed I could out of my service. I never had any problems with them and when I did they always were quick to let me know what the problem was. Also, their customer service was amazing! They answered calls in a timely manner and sent up super helpful techs when they couldn't answer the question. They didn't have long wait times, and were always friendly, helpful and didn't get off the line till I was happy with the solution.", "We needed regular maintenance but the internet speed and reliability was generally satisfactory even with several users on at the same time. Gaming, surfing the web, Skype, and just about anything else we did worked fine with our internet speed. When it was up and running, there were no problems getting connected. However, the service went down several times within the course of a year and a technician had to come out multiple times to fix it, once for 2 days in a row. Also, installation went well the first time, but eventually there was a problem with the router. We had to get everything reinstalled and the internet didn't work for several days. The reps were generally helpful and wanted to help fix our problems. However, there was once when a technician had to come out twice because he didn't fix it the first time, and they did seem reluctant to send someone to help.", "The internet service is pretty good. Speed is sometimes fast but can get extremely slow. At times it won't load pictures when looking at websites and will freeze when watching videos. And sometimes it will stop working and I have to restart my devices in order for the internet to work again. Also, customer service sucks. When I try to do something they don't cooperate and they will charge me more when they don't need to sometimes. But over all it's alright. The installation was pretty fast and easy. There was no problems. The device isn't big and you can't find it in my house if you tried. It's convenient.", "Coming from another provider I chose to go with Xfinity for faster service due to lagging on my old service. The technician was prompt, the internet was fast but they failed to tell me about a data cap of 1tb. My family all work or go to school, Comcast told me we hit our cap in 3 weeks which I find to be impossible. I talked to 5 people from Comcast who told me there had to be something wrong with my internet because less than one percent of all Comcast users use that much. Three told me basically to suck it up and pay the extra 50 dollars each month, NO WAY! The department that is just for internet usage said there is nothing they can do and won't investigate and I had to figure it out on my own. PLEASE! Your measuring service is faulty and you expect me to find it on my own? What am I paying you for! So I canceled before the 30 day trial period ended. \r\n\r\nNext I was told I would receive a full refund. Month one received a bill with a 12.32 credit. Called, talked to someone named Rick. Said no problem, would fix it and I would receive a check in the mail for what I paid. Month two received a bill in the mail for more than I was due to be refunded. Called someone named Tim who said Rick did the wrong thing and would fix it for me. We will see what happens now going on month three still no check??? I do have to say Rick and Tim were courteous and trying to be helpful but confined by the system. The internet department were the rudest people of all who did not want to help me, I am sorry I did not catch the name. I don't know what is up with Comcast but I swear in my lifetime I would rather have no internet/tv than ever use their service again.", "I went to the new Xfinity store in Tallahassee today. Yes, it was a Saturday. Which I would expect retailers and service industry to know that would be a busy day As lots of people have to work during the week. The place was packed. There were only 3 service reps working. And over 20 people waiting in line. I was told the wait would be at least 35 minutes. I waited 40 minutes and was told there were still 7 people ahead of me. Comcast/Infinity continues to be the worst customer service company I have ever dealt with. I wish I another option for hi speed internet speed in Tallahassee. I would never ever invest in their stock.", "First Comcast removed unlimited internet data usage around November 2016, instead you have a 1 TB monthly limit, $10 charge for every 50 GB over. It might sound a lot, but what if it is manually changing the data usage on its end? How do I check on my side? I have an inaccurate data meter on Comcast web page which tracks my usage 24 hours before. Comcast can certainly make a real time data meter which reflects true data usage, but having a data meter like this doesn't show transparency. This way, Comcast can manually increase data usage and charge consumers for it and it would be hard to track its scheme.\r\n\r\nA week ago, towards end of my monthly cycle. I suddenly noticed a 90 GB increase overnight, followed by another questionable 30 GB next day, which was outrageous, because there was no way I would have used that much in 1 night. 90 GB is the equivalent of streaming about 15 1080p movies. I had planned my data usage carefully and have been constantly checking the outdated data meter. Comcast chalked up to a potential \"hacking\" on my wireless router.\r\n\r\nFine, I took that excuse and planned my usage even more carefully. I was watching my usage like a hawk. I unplugged my wireless router between usage, so it would be away from the harm of \"phantom hacker\" in my quiet neighbor. After I came back from 3 hour trip with my wife, the data meter went up about 10 GB, just enough to exceed monthly data usage. I filed complaints with Comcast instantly. It kept escalating the issue to higher end. I was given a reference number and a callback ASAP. I expect it will blame it on my new modem now. It's time to research for an alternate internet subscriber with unlimited data plan, so I don't have to play this game anymore.", "I would not suggest Comcast internet service to anyone. I will be looking for a new provider first thing tomorrow. I am constantly dropped off of the internet. Half of the time I can't get it on my TV for Netflix or Hulu. The other half of the time I can't understand anyone when I call to get help. One guy was so rude he was yelling at me. I'm done with them. Their cable became so expensive I had to give it up and now they have raised the rates of my internet. It would be one thing if it was good internet but mine has been horrible for years. I would rate them a zero (0) in customer care and not much higher in service. I would never EVER recommend them to anyone.", "Worst service and communication I been having the last two weeks after opening a new account with Comcast. Errors in the order, wrong billing. When you call customer service three different stories and never resolved the issue. Two times appointments to receive a technician and never show. Today he show and have to reschedule again to additional job. After another technician will have to come to install the boxes. In summary two weeks and a half and no services after 16 calls and three appointments. NEVER USE COMCAST.", "When I used Comcast their internet was very reliable. I never had blackouts and the reliability was great. The speed of my internet was comparable to Cox. It was fast and always let me connect multiple devices at once without it bogging down. I was very happy with the speed. Comcast installation took a little while. The service tech was on time and he had to run the cable from the wall to my comp and left a little damage. Customer service is just like any other internet service provider. They have average wait times to speak to someone and you are treated fairly well.", "If you are technology smart, Comcast can send you the equipment to set it up, and there is no charge to you. A tech can also come and install it for a fee. They won't leave, until the service is all the way working. The internet service is also resistant against most type of weather. There are also multiple ways to watch your favorite shows including, recording the episode and watch later. Also you can watch video on demand, just set the show to automatically turn on. There is usually great internet service. And even another way to access your internet. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you use it in more than 2 devices, the speed will start lagging. It takes a long time to download and that uses a lot of your monthly data. If you are a gamer or download, even occasionally, you will use all your data by the middle of the month. Then you get hit with overage fees, which can be pricey. Those aside, Comcast customer service are very knowledgeable, trained, and usually nice. It usually does not take very long to troubleshoot the problem and give a way to fix it.", "They are ok but they charge way too much money, and if you call at a certain time, you will be on hold forever. If they focused on their customer more, and listen to what is important to them, they would be a lot better off. The installation process went very smooth with no problems. They were on time, did everything correctly, and made sure everything was right before they left. I am satisfied with the customer service, but I think they ask you too many questions in the beginning of the call. I kind of just want to get to the point of what I need and complete the call. Speed is ok. I do feel like the tech could be a little more knowledgeable about how to make your internet speed the fastest it can be.", "Comcast is very reliable and fast. It's 10mbs and the speeds stayed about the same all the time. It ran more than one thing in my house and that didn't slow it down. I hooked it up myself and it was very easy. Then called Comcast and they activated it and it was on. They sent everything I needed to hook it up with the ethernet cable, coax cable and the modem. It takes a while to get customer service. First automated about 7 different categories then your problem then ask you to go to website. It's faster than you wait for a real person. It takes about 5 to 15 mins then you're finally talking to a real person. Also, the connection went down about once a month but the price kept going up every month.", "The installation was very easy and it was done by the technicians of Comcast. It uses cables and not dish required which in the past was very hard to deal with. Underground cables outside are lot more reliable. Customer service is always good. Any time that I did have question about cable going out or needing assistance with my bill, I had fast and courteous service from the trained professionals. Cable is always reliable. I was able to get HD channels and everything else I need for my family. My internet and wifi are very fast and reliable. No waiting game or internet getting cut off or interruptions which is very important since I use internet for work and my kids use it for school.", "They showed up on time and were very professional. They didn't leave any wires or mess of any kind and I was able to connect to the internet immediately. I live in an area well outside city limits and the internet speed is always good. I have 3 children and my husband and myself all using the internet at the same time and have great speed. No lagging at all. We use it for homework, streaming music and movies at the same time with no problem. But on the rare occasion that I have a problem, I am most impressed with the fact that I can get same day service. Even on Sunday! And they carry repair parts with them you don't have to wait for something to be ordered.", "Comcast is a great reliable service at an affordable price. Our installation technician arrived at the scheduled time and has excellent customer service skills. He knew what he was doing and got the job done in a quick manner. Customer service is great. You really feel like you are a valued customer and that the company appreciated your business. We use several services at the same time and have never had an issue with speed or quality of service. I highly recommend using their service! You will not be disappointed.", "Always awesome to have a great internet provider. The speed of my internet is great. Everything loads quickly. For example when I'm checking my email yahoo.com loads quickly, as well as when I'm logging into the Baltimore Ravens website. Facebook loads quickly, as well as Twitter. I did the installation myself so I wasn't charged extra and the Comcast Customer Service helped me set everything up for example the adapter to combine with the cable and internet. When I call to pay my bill it's usually very quick and I don't need to wait on hold for a half hour.", "You can call Comcast and not have to wait a really long time on hold. They pick up the phone and are ready to help you right away. Never rude or wanting to rush you off the phone, it's really a nice thing to do is to call them and get on with the rest of my day and not have to dedicate my entire day trying to get something fixed or waiting on someone to come out and fix it for me. They came out to my apartment for the installation, and started to do their thing. They never tried to rush and get out, they even cleaned up their own mess before leaving and made sure I knew how to access everything and that the internet worked properly. Some of the customer service representatives can be rude, but that just depends on who all you talk to. Not everyone is nice or has a good day all the time. I get the low income household internet price and for what I pay I get a decent amount of speed.", "The internet speed was inconsistent and did not get good coverage within the house. The signal would go out at times requiring a reboot to get it back up. At times the speed was very fast and at other times it would move extremely slow. This was one major area of frustration. The installer was professional and required little assistance. The unit was small enough that it did not take up too much space and could be placed easily in our entertainment unit. Also, the customer service people were inconsistent in their abilities to assist and in their professionalism. On one occasion we had to call three different times to get in touch with someone who could resolve the issue.", "Comcast Internet Service has really good customer service which I find really useful and good prices thinking about service. The services is really fast and I want to keep doing business with them. When I try to go in wherever webpage that I want it change so fast. The gaming experience I find them so reliable and enjoyable experience. Installer give me a good service. They didn't ask me for more money that we afford. I enjoy the good treat with them. When I have a question or things to ask, I just call them or just email them and I find a professional people who answer with a precision reliable. They are kind and good.", "Comcast delivers constant reliable service at a reasonable rate. Their Customer service makes sure all questions are answered. They are always polite and knowledgeable about any problems you might have. The installation of the internet, phone and wifi was quick and easy. Still, the WiFi goes out now and then but not for long but cable doesn't go out even in bad weather. Also, the speed of my home wifi is fast. Lot less time for pages to load and less waiting time. Comcast is well worth the cost.", "The installation was quick, clean, and easy, and the man was very friendly! He answered all questions we had, and was able to work around our schedule. Whenever I have a question, I am always able to call customer service though times to wait are typically around five minutes, from my experience. But the speed is wonderful. It's quicker than other providers I have used. It will occasionally go down, but it always comes back within a minute or two. My only complaint is that the provider said it would be faster than it is. However, ignoring that and comparing it to other providers, it is very reliable.", "The installation process to connect my whole house and devices, a total of twelve items, took only 30 minutes, and was one of the most pleasant experiences I ever had with the company. The customer service center at XFINITY is really all about figuring out the problem and helping you out in as little time as possible. It is one of the best qualities that XFINITY has to offer compared to other companies. There is an overall satisfactory result in my entertainment experience with XFINITY. Sometimes, however, I feel like it takes too long to buffer when it comes to On Demand programming, especially after an update. Other than that, it is of very good quality.", "Comcast is totally reliable. Sometimes there are some lagging but that is due to how many devices hooked to the Internet. For the most part I can't complain about the service and it is really the most bang for your buck dollar for dollar. The installation technicians were very professional and took out the time to explain how the systems worked. Services came as scheduled and on time. I contacted customer service one time when some things had to be explained due to the confusion on the statement. But it was cleared up right away with no hassle and it was a friendly direction on the online payments scheduling.", "I never had to worry about it not connecting, unlike other items and services I've used. It was amazing and very reliable. Also, it was very easy to connect to and always fast speed. The people who came out came on time and were very polite and also successful with hooking it up. Anytime I needed to call for questions, the customer service reps were polite.", "After the first year \"promo\" $30/month internet I could not longer afford to pay $50/mo. On 12/20/16 called SCAMCAST to disconnect service. Got transferred to disconnect/retention department. I was told I can do another year for $45/month. I agreed to stay connected a little longer. My bill was $50. I called got $5 credited and was told there's no such price $45/mo in my area. On 1/27/17 I called to disconnect service as of 11:59 pm, since I'm paying for the entire day. I was offered a lot of bull such as $50 is a very good price, regular inflated price is much higher, do I have norton antivirus. None of that crap impressed me and I insisted I can't afford to pay $50, disconnect and no further upselling or discussions. Rep agreed to disconnect.\r\n\r\nAt around midnight I expected my internet to disconnect. Today 2/1 I'm still connected. Scumcast has no desire to disconnect. After I got burned the first time, I recorded my second conversation. I never realized the scamcast employees are under such pressure they lie through their teeth. I want to find that rep and ask her WHO ORDERED HER TO LIE TO CUSTOMERS!!! Names of her supervisors, names of executives who told them to lie. Since I'm not the first and only one, I want to instigate a class action and bankrupt this disgusting company. Always record your conversations with SCAMCAST employees. Don't forget to ask for their names, employee ID, names of their supervisors and executives that tell them to lie.", "I have been with Comcast internet for almost a year, I had signed a contract for 1 year, the internet does not work properly, I have had numerous techs out to my house to try to fix the issue and one is blaming the next as to why it keeps going out. Then when you call you get some guy in India who cannot speak English, and have to explain the whole scenario over again. These people are **!! They are supposed to be the best internet provider in the state of Maryland. Total crap. The only thing they are good for is wasting my time and robbing me blind... I will be switching to a different provider at the end of my contract.", "I had services installed on June 21st. They worked for exactly 3 hours. I have been on the phone with them for 7 days for a total of 12 hours. I have been told there is one person that I can talk to, when I call that number I get voicemail that tells me she will call back at her convenience which I'm guessing is never. I called again yesterday to be told another story as to why my services are not working because they have found fraud on my social security #. Which no one has even mentioned in my calls daily. No one has given me the same answer twice. I am totally disgusted with this company and now I'm packing up their equipment and taking it to the local UPS store. My advice never use this company EVER. Customer service is the worst I've ever seen.", "Comcast cable prices are ridiculously high for crappy service! Every week we are calling because either our cable isn't working or the internet is not working. The customer service representatives simply does not care. They are just there for the pay. They told us we had to wait 6 days for a service technician to come out and when I asked for a credit on my account they gave me the runaround.Very upset I left DirecTV for this company. I cringe when I get the bill in the mail. They aren't willing to lower your package. The CSR are rude, inconsiderate, very insensitive. If anyone is looking for a cable service I say run. Do not, I repeat, do not get Xfinity. Poor service for overly priced packages. Not worth the time or money!", "I was being billed over $272.02 a month for eons for triple play with up to 200 mps internet speed and no special channels except Starz. This is a far cry from standard billing. I just had time to research this as I work as a physician. First I looked on the internet where the website did not breakdown all the billing in the largely prix-fix price, except for a bunch of small charges that added up to very little of the total amount. Then I went on the web to find a store to go to near Cambridge MA my home. A variety of addresses came out and I went to each one - all were closed or non-existent. I called Comcast directly and found a store 116 Beacon St in Somerville, not even on the original list. At the store, the rep sat facing a computer screen while I had to stand facing her. She was very nice but I had to use very precise questions to get to the bottom of this. So far, I have not fully succeeded. \r\n\r\nFirst we discovered that I was being billed for 7 not 5 separate COMCAST boxes (total of $12 extra per month = 2,160 over perhaps 15 years). Then I discovered at $10 per month I had spent over $1800 in 15 years for a very dated Comcast modem which I could have purchased separately for a mere $200 - essentially I have purchased 9 modems but only have an old one that I continue being billed for. The rest is a complete void. I did return two out of my 5 boxes, saving $20 a month total. I asked the representative to rebuild my \"Triple Play\" and this came out to ~ $180 or a net savings of ~ $70 per month! So what was I paying for to warrant the $70 per month fee? That is the black hole that each of you needs to research in your own bills.\r\n\r\nI asked for a refund of the two boxes not in my possession that I had been billed for and was credited for $35 as \"Comcast doesn't credit back beyond 90 days\". I was told to take it up by phone with Customer Service and this is an ongoing miserable experience with no new information yet to report. In summary the MBAs at COMCAST have designed a pretty ugly mousetrap for customers to wade through. \r\n\r\nBuy your own modem and determine the different components of your bill. At the store, you are coming in with one problem and the reps are trained to make you buy an even bigger package by pushing over and over. They don't show you their work or give you a receipt for your new package. You can't tell what they are doing while you stand there and they are sitting working the numbers. Apparently the triple play was cheaper than other variations but I did not see the derivation of this info and the numbers on paper didn't add up. Call COMCAST to get the proper address before driving out since the addresses published on line are all mostly duds.\r\n\r\nYou've had to seen it all and be seasoned to avoid being ripped off. So far, I have yet to get to the bottom of my pricing, though with today's adjustments, my monthly bill is now 185 rather than 272 a month. Clearly this is still outrageous. I am not expecting a retroactive refund of the spread, which is huge for really no added value.", "The service is horrible and the moving is worst. It's 15 days till now and they haven't fixed my issue. They keep saying \"there is no other way we can help\" other than waiting. Never experienced such a worst and horrible ISP. Xfinity you are the worst player. Try to keep the promises you made to the customer and never take excuses more than you deserve. Technicians come and they don't fix. Says \"I can't fix.\"", "Comcast sent not one but two technicians over for installation. They were very helpful and were able to overcome whatever issues they encountered quickly. When we wanted to downgrade the package, the customer service representative was really professional and followed up on our request promptly, much to our delight. The service comes with two channels or frequencies. 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz. Some of my devices cannot recognize the higher frequency, so having a second one is extremely helpful. The service is mostly reliable. The outages do not last more than a few hours usually. Of course there is room for improvement. Other than that, I don't have other complaints.", "Comcast's prices are very reasonable, however, their service is only average. Sometimes when the weather is bad it cuts out for no reason and Comcast is notorious for having bad customer service, which means you won't be getting cable or internet back very soon if it goes out. It is impossible to get someone on the phone and even when you do, they almost always have to send you to some kind of supervisor if the problem is anything more than \"Turn it off and turn it back on again.\" I got Comcast through my apartment lease so the installation process was extremely simple. I simply had to pick the box up from Comcast and then the instructions from there were really straightforward, \"Plug this in here and that there\" sort of thing. I have never had an issue with the speed of Comcast that didn't get resolved very quickly on its own or was possibly a problem on my end with a computer struggling with the wifi for some reason or another.", "The internet is extremely fast and reliable. It is fast enough that I'm not waiting more than a minute for a page to load. It gives me the opportunity to work homework, do research or even just play games. There is no freezing and when the weather is horrible there are still no issues with the internet or its connection. The installation was a little time consuming but it was no fault of the installer. The installer was kind and considerate. He explained the process, made sure that all wires were working and made sure that the internet was working before he left. At times the customer service representatives are hard to understand but they are kind and considerate. They make sure to do everything they can to explain any unknown charges while also making sure to solve any issues. They are wonderful having a technician come out as soon as possible.", "The service we received for installation was prompt and courteous. The technician was remarkably cheery and got the job done in roughly 30 minutes. We have remarkably fast internet considering all of the service interruptions. We have had periods of slow internet, but that's usually during peak hours. We have frequent interruptions in service due to outages or faulty equipment and we are always told that we will receive reimbursement for those periods, but have yet to receive said reimbursements. Also, Xfinity outsources its jobs typically to India and other Middle Eastern countries and there have been occasions when it is difficult to understand the customer service Representatives, but mostly they are just very courteous and kind and always willing to help.", "Too expensive but internet was very fast and reliable. Always went to browser page with effectiveness and precision. Plenty of data storage as to not cause any delays in downloading. Clear connection, good Wi-Fi coverage, could stream movies well, wasn't slow to move from screen to screen, high resolution. However, the reps don't take time to understand the issue and there is no compensation or discount for inconvenience or their mistake. And you're charged if they have to come out due to their error. But the installer was prompt and courteous. He took my schedule into consideration and was efficient and knowledgeable of his job. He was able to answer any concerns and gave troubleshooting tips.", "I rely to internet a lot because I do lot of work through internet. Comcast provides quality of network, more reliable to the service when needed in working with kids' projects and do lots of college work, college assignments. Installation is quick process. Within minutes installation completed by myself or by the technician due to some weather technical problems occurred. It takes few minutes to connect to the customer service and provide with solutions to the problem where it occurred when that happened. Internet speed is basically depending on the network. We took 75 Mbps and it runs good for various download and apps installed within few minutes of downloading or getting to it.", "Comcast internet is fast and always up to speed. When it stormed unless power was off, it was always working. It keeps up with all my kids' electronics. We never lose service unless there's work being done in area or power is out. Me and the kids both enjoy the wifi. Installation was quick and easy. They were in and out and they came at the time they said they would. They were very polite. I would recommend them to others. But customer service at times is hard to reach, especially when it comes to being transferred. You can sometimes be on hold for a while but once you get someone, they are polite and helpful.", "The internet speed worked great. It barely ever turned off and we could use more than one computer on the modem and it would still work fast. It would always work and you got a lot of cable channels and you got free Showtime and HBO for 6 months if you were a student. The guys who came to install it were very nice and helpful. They answered any questions we had and were very friendly and made sure everything was working great before they left. Comcast also had great customer service. They make sure you know everything before you even get your service and if you are not happy with your service they make sure to figure out what will make you happy.", "They came out and installed everything, it was very simple and easy on my end. All I had to do was wait for them to get it set up and then I was all set. They have amazing customer service! Comcast is very reliable and any time I have issues they are very quick to help me, even if it means sending someone out to help troubleshoot issues. They have good speed compared to other providers I've had. It doesn't lag, and I have no issues using multiple devices on the wifi. There's enough speed and bandwidth for everyone.", "We got the self install which was very simple, faster, and cheaper. We hooked it up, called to activate and was ready to use in only 20 mins after that. The internet speed that we have is actually the lowest that Comcast has but it still works amazing. We have our phones hooked up, also our computer and smart TV, and everyone in our home can be on at the same time and it doesn't slow down. I would recommend this service to everyone. Even when there is a storm the internet works great. And I love that there is hot spots everywhere. Also, all the Comcast representatives are very nice and respectful. There is no-one else that I have seen that is better to customers than these people.", "You may have heard in Nov '16 Comcast changed its billing for Internet service from unlimited data usage to 1 terabyte included in your package then $10 extra for every 50 gigabytes over the limit. Or you can add an extra $50 a month to your current internet package. They claim this change is due to the %1 of users that exceed the 1 terabyte per month usage. This is a total lie for two reasons. First, companies do not alter their entire pricing packages because %1 uses more than the company would like. Second, this is their response to their lose of TV cable viewers who are switching to watching television online (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs a result if you are one of the many people who watch TV through the internet, then you're probably exceeding the 1 terabyte limit. Clearly this is more than the %1 Comcast claims exceeds this limit. In October I purchased a security camera system offered by Google. Was $600. This system uses my internet and I had purchased when I was under an unlimited data usage plan with Comcast. As a result of Comcast's price changes, I am exceeding the 1 terabyte limit per month and now have to add an additional $50 to my internet service because of Comcast's new policy. Or I'll have to pay $10 extra for every 50 gigabytes exceeded. If I knew Comcast was getting rid of the unlimited data usage, I would have reconsidered purchasing a camera system that uses the internet. After all, it's 2017 and I wasn't expecting my internet service provider to roll back to 2003 standards. Their new policy is a rip off and I despise being lied to.", "I would never willingly subscribe to Comcast. I live in a neighborhood where there is not another option. A very nice and knowledgeable technician came to my house and set up the new box. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it went. He couldn't have been more helpful and I would give him 5 stars! However within a week, I received an email stating that my new equipment was being shipped. I called immediately and said that I did not order equipment. It arrived anyway. I have now spoken to 5 Comcast representatives, all very nice, who have assured me that it would be picked up and have in fact scheduled several pick ups. No one ever came.\r\n\r\nThis morning as I called again, I was informed that it is not their policy to pick up equipment that they sent that was never ordered. I have been told by 2 representatives that a supervisor would call me. They haven't. I don't know why they can't get their act together, but I am totally fed up with Comcast and Xfinity and would change immediately if I had that option", "I have had a positive experience with Comcast/Xfinity for over 20 years. I never had a lengthy disruption of service even through extremely bad weather. The internet speed has always been sufficient. I have experienced some occasional slowness but for the most part the download speed has been very good. Comcast has always provided easy to use instructions and backed it up with great online support that fixed any issues quickly. The customer service team has always been able to correct any issues with either my internet or my cable. They have very polite and knowledgeable representative that are always eager to help.", "Our installation experience was good! The man was friendly, knew what he was doing and was quick about getting his job done. I have had some terrible experiences and this was not one of them. We have the fastest speed you can get. There should be NO issues with three people using the internet at the same time. But there is. And often, it is sort of ridiculous considering it is the fastest we can get in our area. Also, there are a lot of outages. Usually while states at a time. Very inconvenient, super frustrating. When customers aren't given anything to make up for the fact that a service we pay for is down, it is discouraging. Sometimes it seems like I am throwing money down the drain. If we ever have a serious issue with our service, calling them up usually provides some answers and leads to a resolution. However, their customer service representatives are extremely rude.", "Installation was very quick & easy. It took less than 30 minutes to install and I did not have to wait more than 3 days for a technician to show up. The customer service dept has always been very helpful in walking me through any issues step by step & are very patient. They always stay in the line until the issue is resolved or all options have been exhausted. I have never had any problems with the speed of the service. I am always quickly connected whether it be with my computer, phone, tablet or television.  The only problem I have ever had that they could not fix was in regards to connecting Netflix to my smart tv using WiFi.", "Comcast Internet Service is very high speed and always reliable. I rarely experience buffering when watching videos online. I only have problems with speed when it's storming or windy outside. Other than that, we don't typically have outages. Comcast has awesome customer service. The representatives are always friendly and seem happy to help. My questions are always answered effectively. Also it did not take too long for installation. They did not do anything invasive either. The set up was no different from any other service provider. So, I highly recommend them.", "It's very fast internet service. It never buffers unless there is a really bad storm. The only reason it's not fast is from the device I use to access the internet is kinda old. Decent price for the value of fast internet. The installation man came on time and it didn't take him too long to finish. He was nice and polite and very professional. However, customer service kinda sucks. They do fix your problem you call about but sometimes you can be on hold for over two hrs. I even called as soon as they opened and was still on hold for hours.", "We have good service and I like that we have a bundle phone, internet, and cable and that we have an On Demand and that our provider has a mobile app that I can watch live movies on the app. I really like our speed because we really need our speed to be fast because we use the internet all the time shopping and doing job applications all the time. Our installation is very good. We have a basic cable box and it has a vibrant blue light and we change how bright it is. It so cool. I am glad that we have Xfinity versus our old provider WOW and we had a lot of problems with them. We had to get rid of them because they were raising our rate to fifteen percent and that just made me and my dad really mad. The customer service is really good. I'd recommend it to other people because they are willing to work with you when you have an issue with your service like we did before.", "When the Internet is working well, the speeds are very fast but it tends to go out frequently during the morning or night. We have been very satisfied with it so far despite only having it for two months. We love having access to internet around town through Xfinity! The installation was quick & the tech was so friendly! It went in quietly & within a couple of hours. They even helped us figure out how to disconnect & return our old router. I haven't had any major problems but so far it has been great. The one time we have had an issue we received a response in a friendly manner.", "We picked it up at the Comcast store and we could not get it set up. And when a tech guy got here it still took him 1 1/2 hours to get it up. Customer service was ok but some of the operators are very short with customers and put you in a bad mood. They won't even listen to what you are saying like they know everything. But Comcast Internet is reliable and hasn't gone out on us, so I recommend it. The Internet is very fast, and I personally will not use anyone else. We have had other internet providers but they were unreliable.", "My service worked excellent and it rarely needed service. Also, the menu was easy to operate. My installation was great. The servicemen were on time for the appointment and they cleaned up after themselves. The service was installed quickly and efficiently. This was an added cost which increased my 1st bill a lot more than I anticipated. My speed was excellent and I never had a problem with speed. There was a lot less buffering than I experience with my current service but it is a lot more affordable. Vs the cost, I'm comfortable with the buffering now and then. On the other hand, the service was just more than I was expecting to pay and kept going up. Mostly the cost made me change service. In addition, my customer service experience was not as good as the service, to say the least. There a few areas the company could work in to improve the overall customer experience. CSR were sometimes short, and not helpful.", "Very nice installer and people in the field are helpful and courteous. They explained the problem and then troubleshoot issues until it finally worked. The speed is just OK. Just enough to use daily but not enough for gaming or something more robust. Could be better without charging a crazy amount. Connection was down for 3+ days with people not having a solution and did nothing to help. They just changed the router out. It did not work again and continued to have more issues. Customer service just want you to upgrade or figure out a way to get you off the phone. Not a great help here. They are very unpardonable and I've called back multiple times.", "Service is fine, not many problems. Satisfied with it in the time I've had it. No issues with the product or the installation at all. Haven't had any outages. Easy to use. The customer experience is ok. Haven't had long wait times when calling customer service. Pretty quick and seamless. The internet speed is pretty good. Haven't had problems with much time outs or lagging even in bad weather. Would probably recommend to others.", "The internet service is okay but the Customer Service is the worst. It was awful. They can't help you and transfer you to all these different departments, and usually speak broken English. Never know what's going on with your account. They never update your info or fix the things they say. They offer you things but never apply it to your account. \r\n\r\nThe person that installed was nice and informed but we were supposed to have a special and they charged us full price, then claimed it wasn't offered in our area but we have a confirmation email saying we do have it. The internet speed is pretty quick. Overall the service is good but if you have any problem, good luck with trying to fix it. They will charge someone to come fix most likely.", "Comcast internet speed is very efficient. I get my work done so much faster now that I'm not lagging so slow with the internet. My family and I watches and prerecords a lot of movies as well as watching live tv for football or other sports we enjoy. The man who came to install our dish felt like a tree needed to be taken down. But when we removed the tree he realized it wasn't necessary and it was a large growing healthy birchwood which our moose rely on to eat when they migrate down the mountains to find better food. The remotes were easy to use and we don't have to walk to the boxes to manually look for a show by clicking the channel up and channel down when recording dvrs. It worked great overall but was very expensive.", "The internet service works fast and I can watch movies online, download music and stream movies. It's good for me and my family and we can do whatever we want to do. It's fast for the money I pay for it. It's good for those who likes gaming and streams movies especially if there are more people in the house using Internet same time. Also, customer service is always helpful, knows how to satisfy the customer, and are quick in solving problems, and I don't have to wait long for connecting with customer service. I'm overall happy and satisfied with how it works and will recommend people to use it.", "We signed up for basic, but the installer hooked up full package with no extra charge. The installer was friendly, helpful, professional, knowledgeable and was very accurate estimating his arrival time. Customer service is great. They have quick reply time and signup, offered discounts on new desktop with service and did not turn off service due to late payments. However, the signal does not always reach other side of large house and cuts in and out at times but it handles multiple devices easily. Also, the internet speed gets backed up when too many devices are used simultaneously with Netflix. Would like to see stronger signal but other than that, it's a great deal.", "The speed and connection were rarely an issue. We were very satisfied with bandwidth, ease of access and ease of use. We have hopped around from service provider to service provider. There were few, if any, other competitors that could rank up with its speed. The prices, though, became too spend your for what was offered through the service. But what better kind of installation than simply unpacking and plugging in? If not only that, representatives were accessible and on site within a reasonable time to install for us. In addition, the customer service representatives were only a phone call away. The majority of the time, they knew exactly what the fixes were and helped solve problems swiftly.", "Comcast was always there and working when I needed it on. It could be counted on even when in school for projects and online tests. There's no issue with speed. We have no problems with the internet timing out or having larger buffering episodes while watching Netflix. The installation was as easy as possible and had no issues with getting it set up where we wanted it and without any extra mess or headache. I dealt with customer service during the set up and they were great and easy to work with.", "Everything went accordingly during the installation. However, the internet would sometimes disconnect. The speed can be incredibly slow and usually is somewhat slow. On today's world speed is key and that should not even be an issue. They need to work on that.", "I'm a gamer and movie streamer. Comcast residential speeds they provided satisfied my need for speed. Whether I was playing Call of Duty for NBA 2K, always seem to have enough megabytes to do what I had to do. I could usually rely on connectivity redeem during intense storms. To be able to access up-to-date local news comforts me. However, the costs exceeds the value of the service. Paying $200 internet or cable services is unreasonable when you consider the earning power of most of their residential market. Most of the people on the other side of the phone for Comcast don't like their jobs. Having to defend prices for an employer that are greedy and exploitative over a product that is the lifeblood of communication has to turn their stomachs.", "The installation was fast and the tech was on time even a little early, very friendly and was able to tell me how everything worked. Good customer service. When I call I get who I need right away and they will stay on the line until they can help me. I have the bundle with them and I have not had any serious problems arise. Holds up good in bad weather and good quality picture. Also, my speed is awesome. When I first started I had low speed but they keep on increasing it without upping my payment. I have one of the fastest speeds out there for the value.", "They were on time, got done fast. Were very polite and courteous, and cleaned up all the mess. When I had to call for help, they had a worker in the area and he came right over and fixed the problem. Internet speed is great most of the times but the internet is always going to have a slow time. Also, they have done all they could to make my internet as fast as possible. Customer service is top rated. Made me feel like family. They also offer great deals. They go above and beyond to keep customers happy. I would recommend them to all my friends.", "Installed it myself easily. Was originally sent a cable modem that did not work and then was not sent the correct login password. Was a bit of a pain to begin service. Generally quite fast and reliable, even on my older, slower computer. Still not exactly sure what the blast is. The internet blast is kind of stupid though.  They call a ton to try and get me to upgrade or switch service. This may be a third party but it is annoying. Never really needed much help otherwise. Never a problem except occasionally during peak hours. Generally works well. Very rarely loses internet service but for the most part it is smooth sailing. Frustrating price increases.", "The service is affordable and reliable. No interruptions to the service. They even offer package bundles to help you save money. I highly recommend using this service over any other providers out there. The best internet speed connection around. No hassling with low internet speed. My programs don't lag and I don't have to wait for pages to fully load. Also, the customer care was absolutely awesome. Very kind and helpful. A twenty four hour service that you don't have to pay extra for. They also offer a follow up call.", "The speed is pretty good most of the time. I play World of Warcraft and rarely have much lagging issue with it. I never usually have problems with the speed when playing videos either. But the main problem I have is my cable going out or the router resetting itself without warning and my wifi going out or slowing down to a crawl. This last time wasn't too bad but the guy who did my installation at my old place was much faster and more efficient. They did clean up all the extra cord length from the last person who lived here and switched out my old equipment for newer ones. I haven't had much interaction with the customer service lately but, it was fairly easy to get my issues taken care of when I did contact them, my issues were resolved with minimal effort or wait time on my part.", "Comcast is reliable most of the time. There are definite lags in speed at times, though we try to take that in stride. I have not been dissatisfied in Xfinity/Comcast. The person who came out to install service was very friendly and went out of his way to make everything work well. I wish all their employees were that good. However, customer service has not always been stellar. I've found out about price deals and when I've called about it, the reps treat me politely, but seem like they are bothered that they have to do some work.", "Well coming to hook up the guy was very knowledgeable on what he was doing and he was very quick, was in and out of my house probably in about 30 minutes. Plus, the customer service really don't have long wait times and they're really helpful even over the phone. Most places it takes you forever to be able to even contact anybody. I've had a lot of different service providers and they are by far the fastest. I have not had a problem with streaming music, streaming movies or anything. Xfinity is very reliable, it's just fantastic all the way around and best ever. I strongly recommend it and you get great cable too.", "I do not opt for the fastest bundle possible, but I usually run my wifi and internet on multiple devices at once (streaming music, streaming Netflix, going online on a computer or tablet, using wifi on my smartphone) and never run into slowness. Also, I have only called less than a handful of times in the past few years and they have always solved my problems. I never have any problems with their customer service. In addition, I feel like the installation was quick and relatively on-time.", "Comcast has off periods with slow speed downloads because rain & cold weather does affect service. The speed's usually good between the hours of 11 pm to 2 am then they have issues the rest of the time in my area with loss or no network available, no connections and 'try later' messages. The contract lock down even with service & technical disputes, fees not explained at sign up of service. They also did an incomplete installation. A week before service was installed with continued technical & equipment issues, they have additional charges even though it was technician's fault & faulty equipment. We're 3 months into service & still having problems w/ service & billing. Customer service is pleasant & professional. Some very helpful, some not so much. Many have tried yet we are still paying for a service. So we are locked in or mess up your credit.", "The installation process was simple and well defined by adequate personnel who walked me through every step of the process. Very courteous and efficient. Internet speed was adequate for my needs, there was rarely any interruption time and when this occurred it was for a minimal amount of time. Also, never had issues with lack of service and could always be counted on, never had to worry about accomplishing my tasks on an everyday basis. Customer service staff was knowledgeable and helpful with any concern or question I might have had, they were friendly and courteous with an eagerness to help.", "The speed of the internet was remarkably great and reliable. It was always at very high speed and that's what I was looking for. There was never a time that I had to wait for it to get fast or a slow moment. I was always able to connect even with bad weather and no matter where I was I could connect my wireless devices to the wifi. The installation was very fast and easy from what I watched them do. They came in and had me all set up within an hour. They were very professional and courteous. Customer service was good also but the only problem that I had with it was that most of the reps spoke English as a second or third language and I had to keep repeating myself or could not understand what they were saying.", "Decent service, but occasionally blacks out because no matter how many times we try to set automatic payments for our bill, it doesn't work, and our service gets shut down. Internet speed improved over time, but sometimes streaming video stalls out, or we have grainy video, regardless of the website/app. But downloads and uploads are rarely a problem. Overall, fine.\r\n\r\nOur techs were (and usually are) friendly. They installed an additional line for our apartment to improve service and stayed until I was definitely online. But while the reps are courteous, we had an issue with service and the rep confirmed, since it was an issue on their end, we would not be charged for a tech to come and take a look. Of course, Comcast DID charge us. But as it is, they should be providing this kind of service to their paying customers as an ISP. They already get to charge whatever they want in essentially a monopoly. WHAT A RACKET. Swindlers, intermittent service, liars.", "Shortly after signing up for the service, a technician arrived. He was on time and seemed well prepared with all of the necessary equipment for the job. Within 20 minutes, our service was active and since then, we have never had any major problems. The internet service is very stable and If needed, A technician is usually only a phone call away. Their customer service is also very helpful. Calls are answered with very little waiting time and an agent is always eager to be of assistance. Everyone I have spoken with were Very friendly and eager to help. Also, their customer service agents all seem to be well trained and up to date with regards to the company's policy and procedures. They are very motivated and in most cases resolve any questions and concerns within the first 10-15 minutes. I would certainly recommend this company based upon this fact.", "Comcast came when they said they were going to. I didn't have to wait around all day. The installation person was very nice and helpful. He answered all my questions. There were very few issues. I've only had to contact customer service a few times but when I did, the reps were always courteous and knowledgeable. My issue was always resolved with one call. I've used a few different providers and this speed is just about above average compared to others. I was pleased with the performance.", "Comcast has always been very reliable for us. I have never had any issues, even things like outages never seem to happen. This is especially great and wonderful when the kids are stuck in the house and need to be entertained while mom does laundry or dishes. Installation was fast and easy. I got a box in the mail and it instructed me through the installation and I couldn't have been more pleased with myself or Comcast. They really make it completely idiot proof and I like that about ANY instructions.\r\n\r\nI have not really had any real issues with my cable or internet so I haven't really had to use much of the Comcast customer service. Any time I have spoken to them, however brief, they have been calm, friendly, professional, and extremely helpful and knowledgeable about anything I could have thought to ask about! The install was SO EASY and fast as heck to get through, and my Internet has been very fast and I have been very satisfied with all of my service overall. The things I needed to do the installation myself came within a few days of me ordering it.", "Installation didn't really take that much long. Was in and out pretty quick very very fast. I would recommend this service to anyone if they not using it for work. Also, great customer service, very friendly people, very helpful and on top of everything. They always willing to help with anything you need help on. But speed is not the best with this internet company. Sometimes it's fast then other times it runs slow but it's dependable and did OK.", "I called to upgrade from just internet speed 75 to cable, home security & internet speed 150. After all said and appointed set got Thursday between 3 to 5pm. Thursday comes. Got a call at 3:15pm confirming my appointment for Friday between 5-7pm. Ok. Comes Friday tech shows up and the order is wrong. All he has is to upgrade internet so he did nothing and left. Been calling customer service multiple times. Been put on hold and crazy feels like they are doing me a favor by answering the phone and me trying to upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis is a very very bad way of doing business. Someone calling you to upgrade, pay you more money and your service personnel messes the whole order and now been on and off hold with a lady with an attitude for now 25 minutes plus with nothing been resolved. COMCAST SIMPLY THE WORST COMPANY, IT'S SEEMS THEY JUST DON'T CARE.", "About 2 months ago Comcast changed its email set up. I can say it is totally unsatisfactory! I have read a number of complaints about their new system. If it isn't upgraded to poor at least I will switch to FIOS!!!", "Every time there has ever been a problem a very appreciative and grateful technician has showed up and fixed the problem. They are very nice about every situation and take into consideration my situation. I am very impressed with Comcast and its services. The installation process is very quick and a very informative technician shows the different things about the device and informs me of the set password. The customer service is amazing. They are always very friendly and show initiative. The speed is fantastic!! Even during a storm it boots right back up quickly without any problems. I love it and would definitely recommend.", "Very dissatisfied with Xfinity Internet. Sometimes our internet loses its connection several times a day, it is very frustrating! AT&T is way better by far. Comcast don't fix the issue of losing its connection, and also they don't take no money off my bill neither! Furthermore, it is extremely slow. I am not satisfied at all about the speed being so darn slow. I wouldn't recommend Comcast Internet to anyone not even my family or friends. I am also dissatisfied with their customer service because whenever I called them to explain about our service getting interrupted, they wanted to charge me an extra fee to my bill for doing so. On the other hand, the installation of Comcast was a fairly easy and nice experience, I have no complaints about that part. It went well getting Comcast to hook us up with internet service, and they seemed very friendly about doing it.", "Comcast works pretty good even with bad weather. Everything runs smoothly. I'm happy with my service and the price I am paying. The installation was fairly quick and simple. The guys were very friendly and nice. They made sure all the wires were secure and safe and everything was working. Customer service is also good to an extent. I've had some issues with them over the phone. Some people were nice and helpful and others were a bit rude and inattentive. The internet speed is pretty good and I am happy with it.", "Comcast charge you to ship you their products that you have to use and installers are late for appointments and sometimes want you to pay even more for worthless services you can easily do yourself. Internet service-wise, I'm always connected but sometimes service can be slow during the daytime especially during the peak rush hours. Then it can be greatly and noticeably slower. Its also a love hate relationship with the speed. Sometimes it peaks, sometimes it drags but it rarely is ever what it is advertised as or even at the speed of the price point you probably are paying for no good reason. \r\n\r\nComcast also has rehearsed reps on the phone and lots of automation throughout the customer. I tend to do self-service stuff on their site because there I can find the information I need much quicker and understand much better than the hourly paid phone banks I get sent to upon calling their number. The installers when they do get to the appointment generally are nice but sometimes I feel like they are trying to sell things I don't need.", "The installation experience was fairly simple and hassle free especially compared to other internet service providers that I have tried in the past. And so far I am happy with the customer service. Also, its speed ranks up there in the top service providers and works at maximum potential for the majority of the time. I am pleased and I would definitely recommend this one.", "They are a service that has okay reliability. Their speed is good when the internet works. Oftentimes, the internet is down for me, but when it's working I'm somewhat satisfied with the speed. Installation was okay service-wise. The amount of time they made me wait was dissatisfying. But when they finally got there, it was a speedy installation. However, they aren't very good customer service-wise. In my experience, they take awhile to even get a worker to your place and the time range is way too long to wait. I once had a worker not even show up after waiting countless hours and not going into work because it was \"the only day\" they could do it.", "The service that was provided for the installation of Xfinity and Comcast internet was a very helpful, fast and easy experience. The customer service that was given to me was pretty decent. Also, the internet was reliable for the most part. It could be better but for being in a rural area the internet speed is pretty quick for the family to work on homework. Though I wish at times that the internet would be a bit faster, I can't be too picky. I would recommend the company if anyone were to ask.I", "It is very easy to install and get started. It takes about 20-30 minutes to turn on and be fully ready for use though. But the internet goes down a lot. The basic service speed isn't very good which is the one I have. I'd recommend going with a higher speed. And when I call Customer service it is ok but it's sometimes hard to understand the people on the other end of the line because of their accents.", "I called 4 other local service providers and Xfinity was able to give me an install appointment to come do install within 24 hours of my phone call. Then they gave me a 4 hour window of 12-4 pm. They were at my door at 12:10. And the tech was an absolute doll. He was very knowledgeable and had the entire install done in 30 min. Wonderful!!! I always had all questions or problems I had on my account taken care of and handled to my satisfaction. I did have a couple of cs reps that were rude so I would tell them to put their supervisor on the phone and after speaking to supervisors on the situation they not only documented my problem I had with them and they contacted me back in 24-48 hours with the outcome of their investigation and the person I complained about had been fired. That is good customer service.\r\n\r\nNow that I am (temporarily) stuck using a different provider I can say first hand that Xfinity is faster than any of its competitors. Their speed is at least 2x of the other providers. I never had any problems with Xfinity. It didn't matter how many items were running off the wifi it never had a buffering problem. It never lost connection and was far faster than any of the other companies I have used. I can't wait for my current contract to end so I can return to Xfinity.", "It's great and very fast. I like their programs. It's reliable and well known. I like their services. They give you a lot of choices. Customer service was great. They were cheerful and happy to help me and answer my questions. Gave me specials. They were very helpful to solve my problems. They answer any questions you might have. If you have problems with internet or service they resolve it. They came in time and they answer my questions. They connect my service fast. Program my remote control to the box and t.v. I'm very satisfaction with internet service's speed. It's fast and it does not take a long time to load up. I like I don't have to wait. I'm able to surf without waiting for a long time.", "Our installation was typical as far as I can tell but everyone involved was very friendly and very professional and there were no issues throughout. As far as our major issues are concerned, I have never had an issue that was left unresolved. When I have expected problems, the customer service has been excellent but there have been a couple of representatives that I would rather not have had to deal with. Also, I have never thought of our service as anything but fast. Anytime I experience a delay (which is rare) I know that there is a problem with the device or the service. I have never had any issues with regular service and have only experienced two outages in the past six years.", "We love the high quality of speed and it is lightning fast. My service is reliable and have had no issues with it at all.  Also, we had no issues with installation. They came and hooked it up right after we ordered our internet. They were professional, polite and very quick getting the job done correctly. We have always had polite customer service reps and they have always gone out of their way to help us with anything we need. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good service provider.", "Fastest internet I have ever had. The speed is phenomenal and downloads take no time at all. It's great for streaming and gaming and can stream multiple devices at once with ease. I never had a problem with loss of service or outages. Great price, too. Also, I did the self installation and it was very easy if you have a basic knowledge of how this stuff works. And the instructions are to the point. Moreover, from what I have heard, their customer service is very pleasant and easy to deal with. I would recommend this to anyone.", "I have had Comcast, since it was established I have moved to three different cities, still kept the television subscription and the range of channels and service never let me down. The installation was smooth until I moved to a downstairs apartment. Comcast had to send a representative three times until they had to dig a new line outside my apartment. After that the subscription was great. The clarity and speed of my internet is extremely fast and efficient, there's hardly a break in service until the early am hours which is a positive factor to always have great customer experience. Also, I have received excellent customer service dealing with the Comcast representative.", "The service is slow and outages were frequent. DSL is faster, and cable should never be slower than DSL even when it is the economy package. 2 bar 4g is faster, so frequently tether phone to laptop. The customer service from Comcast is very scripted, with long hold times and run around were frequent features, if you could reach a person. They are of no help and frequently said it was on our end when it wasn't.", "The connection speed is one of the main reasons to use this service provider. It is important to me to have all my systems working at an efficient speed to get my work done and Xfinity allows me to get tasks completed easily and swiftly. It is reliable and I especially can depend on it when it is storming outside or there is bad weather or cloud coverage in general. This is important to me because I have lived in different climate areas and weather is what always complicated any work I had to get done online or any leisure activity like watching a movie that I tried to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe installation of my services was easy and done by a professional. They came in and hooked it all up and it was up and running no problems. It was free installation too which is very nice when on a budget like me. Also, the customer service team was great and very helpful whenever I had any questions and any issues I came across. Sometimes it was difficult to get my point across into words but their service team caught on to what I was intending to say and worked with me to get my needs met, even if I did not use the correct lingo, they still understood me.", "The internet connection works well and doesn't fluctuate very much. I normally get a very good signal. The speed is good and I rarely have problems with it. I don't watch many videos online but when I do they usually load quickly and don't stagnate. However, getting in touch with a person is difficult and when you do they always try and sell you other things like cable tv and more stuff that you don't need even when you tell them you don't need or want it. The installers came and were done relatively quickly. However they were late showing up and they do not pick up equipment when you move. You have to ship it or take it to them and fill out forms.", "I have never had any issues with not being able to connect to the internet or not being able to watch a program on TV. It always is dependable. The workers that installed the internet were very nice, courteous, and respectful. They keep your best interest at heart. They work around your schedule and will come by to help you with any issues. I have never been put on hold for more than 5 minutes and I can always talk to a service provider when needed. They fix anything they can over the phone and send a worker out when needed. My internet has always been fast and never seems to slow down. We often have more than one person using the internet at a time but you can't tell because it doesn't affect the speed or quality.", "The installation was done by an independent contractor hired by Comcast. This can be hit or miss: our first installation was terrible - just fastened wires to the side of my house. After noisily complaining, we got it redone for no cost. Comcast truly treats you like a number and seems to go out if its way to be difficult - even if they make mistakes (which happen frequently). Their commonly perceived terrible standards for customer service are well earned. However, speed is not bad. Our wireless devices seem to function at reasonable speeds, but certainly do not reach the advanced metrics they promote. We have generally strong & consistent connection. We can usually pick it up all through our house & garage. It also extends to areas of our yard, but that tests our connection limits.", "Comcast has been overall very reliable over the past 4-6 years. Speed is very fast, even using wifi it is very fast. I can download and upload files and things super duper fast and it's amazing. Freaking great, man. In the beginning when I joined them about 15 years ago they had some issues but they have gotten so much better. I can't even remember the last time that I had down time from the service. The installation was also extremely fast especially if you already have cable wires ran through the house. They do install very well. I've had so many positive encounters with customer service. They are very helpful and really make things right fast. If you have a problem they will fix it fast or get someone there who can.", "Internet is fine and reliable but for money, it's expensive. Some people have low income and I can barely afford it. Installation process did take 2 hours and was not a pleasant situation. I was surprised that the team managed to figure it out and for that reason I was grateful. Customers service is great, but the way I see it is they're always offering me more deals as a customer which I would have to pay more for more package which I do not want but get phone calls.", "During the installation, had very limited times available to pick time to hook up. However the gentleman was nice, helpful and arrived on time. He drilled holes in our walls and took out the old cable from old owners. Internet works great but does have too many outages. We also have black spots in the house that has very bad or no connection at all. We are also not happy with price at times as internet is slow and have to pay more to get faster. But their customer service helped to resolve issues when we contacted them and were always available. However, the hold times on the phone were less than desirable and would like to be able to schedule a callback.", "Most of the time the speed is usually great and I'm satisfied with it. There are times when it seems to drag but that doesn't happen very often. It goes down every couple of months but usually only down for a couple hours at the most. Phone representatives are not good though at accurately knowing the time it will be back up, but they are pleasant and helpful unless they are told you're not satisfied with the cost and are interested in downgrading your plan. The installer showed up on time and was very friendly and helpful, but did not do a good job making the service user friendly so I could solve problems on my own.", "My connection has never gone down and my router always works. I can use it all day every day with no issues. It's super fast and powerful. I am happy with the speed of my blast internet plan. I can play the fastest games and watch the latest movies while multitasking on different devices. The installer came promptly and finished in under an hour. He was very polite and worked hard to troubleshoot until he could get my service up and running. The customer service on live chat is always polite and helpful. They work hard to retain my service and offer me the best deals whenever I call them.", "My installation experience was pretty straight forward. The tech came by when they were supposed to and they installed the equipment for me. The whole process took about an hour or so and afterwards, the tech explained how to work the service. The customer service is some of the best. Whenever I have a question or concern, they are always around to help me no matter how trivial the matter is. They are really committed to their customers and they take their time and there is no rush. The reliability was pretty good. I could count on the internet working even during bad storms and peak hours. The internet speed is great and it's super fast compared to what I'm used to. I used to have really slow internet before Comcast. Videos and games would take forever to upload. Now my devices were never offline and I'm very satisfied with the speed of Comcast Internet service.", "Internet has high speed and I haven't had any interruptions. Brand new to the service. I can hook up & run all my phones, tablets, computers at the same time with no interference. Also I have WiFi on the road, live stream tv, videos. Company working just fine. Clear pictures and I got exactly what was told I would get. Customer service was also great. She was direct & helpful and helped me pick the best affordable package for myself & family even though I didn't get what I supposed to get but it was corrected in a timely manner. However, they was late during the installation. The service man took all day. He used his phone for private calls. Wrong equipment installed & wire job in one of the rooms was loose.", "Since I subscribed to this service, I never had any problems about internet connections and signals over my tv. Its speed is incredibly fast and very reliable. My money was worth it. Their installation process was also very fast and very easy. No complications arose and the agent doing the installation was an expert of what he was doing. I would recommend its customer service. They can be reached in a lot of ways whether social media online or by phone and whenever I have questions I always get clear answers. Comcast is awesome.", "Installation was good and easy. No hassle, no bulky wires or satellites, and everything went over smoothly. Someone installed it for me for free so that was good. The only problem is trying to get my dogs from pulling at the wires. Service reliability was ok although connection messes up on stormy days. The bill sometime would often change and that wasn't cool and was part of the reason I left the company. Customer service was ok when an actual representative was on the line. I was on hold for quite a while and I don't like talking to pre-recorded automated robot voices.", "Our installer was on time and very thorough. He let us know what was being done in each room and cleaned up all of the plastic and boxes and made sure everything worked before he left. The customer service is good and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Also, all questions I asked were answered fully and clearly. The internet speed is very good. Our old internet was very slow and if more than one person in the household used it it would get slower and slower. It was very frustrating especially for the gamers in the house. But Comcast internet doesn't slow down when several people are using it at the same time. And I never have any down time when it storms.", "Our installation was very simple and we had very little to do to get setup. Our tech that came to the house was very helpful and told us what to do and how to set things up on our end. Also, any time I've ever needed help with anything I've always had prompt service. I've used phone and FB message in the past and was helped quickly and the problem was resolved. In addition, I have had very little interruptions with my service. Even during storms and such, the service is 99% reliable. I would love for things to be super fast when I'm using the internet but for the most part, I don't have to wait too long for things to load. It's a great company to go with for your service.", "I've been a Comcast customer since 2009 in Houston, many years before that in Chicago; latter was good service. But in the last few years here in Houston, it's gotten really bad. Yesterday, suddenly I wanted to learn what Xfinity wifi did, so on one of my machines -- I don't maintain a network, all machines are Win7 -- suddenly via a WIRED machine I couldn't access a website, JUST AFTER on a different device, I connected to Xfinity wifi (as hotspot). KEY: there was a splash page offering to download an Xfinity app for secure connection, and I turned it down. I was on a laptop, so didn't think a mobile app would be suitable. THAT is when the problem occurred, and the 'app offer' literally splashed a transparent image over the site I was accessing. Though none of my computers are on a network, somehow that nonetheless prevented them from even accessing the DOMAIN, so long as I use that modem.\r\n\r\nLost 12 hours troubleshooting, had to reset modem, now ALL machines (none being networked) using THAT modem cannot access that same ONE site. But if I use Xfinity wifi hotspot, no problem. Any other websites, no problem. Comcast finally came out today, and the guy insists it's NOT Comcast's problem, that it must be the website. But if it were the website (which it is, I know coz it's MY DOMAIN which I've run for 15 years), then it wouldn't be accessible by wifi hotspot, either. Domain has no problems. But Comcast won't accept that obvious proof it's something in their 'app offer', even denying there is one. The arrogance of this denial, plus years now of ineptitude lasting hours with every phone call, is too much. So I'm done with Comcast. As soon as I can find another provider with wifi hotspots also available, I'll leave.", "Now that Comcast has released 2 months ago that you are limited to 1024gig of data before extra charge kicks in, and sent out a usage report of what you have been using to make you feel better about getting a cap. Has anybody else noticed they are using a lot more data than before? I work from home and I'm on the computer 10 hrs a day and watch Netflix while I'm working and we had been around for our average 650 gig. Last month and this month I have been over by 550 to 600 gig. So I call to find out what the overage cost is and lo and behold \"It's $10 per 50 gig or you can go unlimited for 50 a month more.\" Well there it is. \"Give us another 50 and you get unlimited.\" Interesting. Now this month after adding the 50 unlimited plan I see a 60 dollar overage and when I call I was told that is credited and my bill should be 286 yet the paper statement and the online statement both show 346 due. Lies all around.", "This is the WORST service I have ever experienced. My fiance and I pay $50 a month to have high speed internet and every morning I turn my TV on to watch Netflix it EASILY says there is no internet connect and stops in the middle of the show 10+ times over an hour or 2 of watching. Every morning I try logging into my computer I have to completely unplug the router and restart everything just to use safari. If anyone is thinking of using this service it is without a doubt a complete waste of your time and money!! It is the most frustrating, terrible, worst service I have ever used. Don't do it!!!", "Comcast came the day and time they said they were. Tech set up three boxes with what it seemed like little time. They are open 24/7. They have apps that I could go on for anything or any problem I may have. I don't always have to call but when I do, I'm always talking to a friendly person. My Internet runs super super fast even if there's multiple phones logged on at the same time. It takes me seconds to download and run any app or website I want. I never have to worry about if my service is gone work because they have one of the best Internet services out there. I would tell everyone I know to get their services.", "The basic are awful. I have switched out several boxes and they only worked for a few months. The installer was very courtesy and helpful and was knowledgeable on installing the best place to run the wire; he made sure all the tv was getting a clear picture. However, customer care was not helpful. Very hard to get thru; I could not get an explanation of my billed charges. The customer service rep was hard to understand because of the language barrier as well as her tone was very low. Furthermore, she sounded sarcastic and very irritated when I asked her if she could repeat the question because I could not hear her at all. The internet speed was fast enough so that I can reach customer service much quicker. This helped a lot because it provided a quick solution to my problems.", "My cable provider came to my house with all the needed supplies for the job. They got the job done quick and efficiently with minimal disruption or inconvenience to me in my household. They have great customer service with friendly and knowledgeable staff whom are all willing to help you and assist you with your selection of products or services. No pressure when recommending other items. They let you ask questions and give you time to evaluate the different items or features and lets you choose based on your particular needs. The speed of the internet was very fast and efficient with me completing my tasks in a quick and efficient manner. It gives me time to concentrate of more matters of importance.", "Never had a connection drop or intermittent wifi issues. Thanks for the constant connection. The router does provide easy use and one button direct connection after you go to advanced settings in your wifi tab and hit wps push button on the top of router. 40 mbps wifi is sufficient for any home use. Download speed is very fast although I only use the connection for simple apps such as 8 ball pool by miniclip.", "Never had any complaints regarding speed of their internet service. It was always more than my needs and I was able download files with no problems. Very limited outages - most were weather related. All service calls went smoothly. Always received fast and friendly service when I called in with questions or problems. All issues were quickly handled. Staff was very helpful. I was very happy with service. Installation also went very smoothly, I had no problems or complaints that I can recall.", "I rarely have problems with the service. Even during storms, the internet rarely ever goes out.The internet is high speed and the top speed available, so no problems with slow internet at all. The download is the fastest I've ever had from any internet provider. It's lightning fast and dependable. The wifi is great, too. I didn't have any problems installing it. The directions were very easy to follow. I didn't need the internet provider to install it, I was able to do it myself, it was that easy. The customer service is great. Whenever I need to call, I get my problem solved quickly. I also rarely have to wait long to talk to somebody.", "Customer service was sometimes not very helpful. Most of the time problems took forever to be fixed or weren't fixed and the person over the phone was rude. Customer service definitely could have been better. Installation was quick and painless. The technician was very qualified and I was very satisfied with this part. The speed was excellent WHEN I wasn't having problems with the service.", "It's very reliable with little or no down time. The speed is of the fastest I have seen in other companies in its league. All my technology gear can be up and running at the same time. Comcast's customers service is beyond reproach. You talk to an actual person that treats you like a valuable customer. They are very knowledgeable in their area and will inform you ahead of time when a schedule maintenance or service is going to occur. The technician that were sent were very knowledgeable of the service and equipment, nice, well dressed and professional. It's a company I would recommend to others.", "We have very few problems with Comcast. They are very friendly and helpful. We no longer have the issues of having a satellite dish. We would never go back to previous service. Their installers were knowledgeable, quick and very efficiently installed all of the products for the triple play package and showed us how everything works on the new platform. They arrived on time and took the time to make sure we were comfortable with how everything works. \r\n\r\nWe had a few occasions to have to place a call. One call generally takes care of any situation. Wait time was minimal and the representative was friendly and knowledgeable. We did not need to go through multiple transfer to different departments. Concerns and problems were taken care of with one call each time. Most of the time, internet speed and cable TV speed is very quick. One drawback is when multiple users (3 people in college) are accessing internet, there may be a slight difference in speed, but not enough that it draws from the internet experience.", "Rarely have I had any stoppages for anything, but weather. The times I did have issues, the matter was settled quicker than was anticipated. They always were so glad to be of assistance, and were always polite and professional whenever I had a problem. I have a few issues with the speed, but, I do have an old laptop I use, so I just lend that issue to my own inability to replace the item.", "They will try their hardest to install everything for you by sending someone out. What they do not tell you upfront is that it costs an extra sixty dollars...that only for the visit and not the installation. Other than that you can hook everything up by yourself with ease and common sense. Their customer service is very nice most of the time. However they will constantly try to avoid giving lower deals even if it means lying to them. Try disconnecting your service with them and they will argue how it is the best service ever. They connected me to their billing department to lower my bill and disconnected my call three times. \r\n\r\nIf you can bypass the sugar coated low rates first handed out and the sharp rising rates later, the service is actually really good, no lag, no frequent black out, very fast. I never had a problem with the speed. If you do it has something to do with your equipment or wires. Word of advice connect directly into your modem and do not use a router. The modem has a firewall and so does your router, it may not cause grief with you but it will cause grief for others connected to your server.", "My installation was done quick in a day and even set up for me. Helpful advice given and after installation makes me want recommend Comcast to family and friends. Comcast has excellent service and signal. Internet speed is great, you can watch live streaming and package available for you choose from. Very fast, no buffering, no waiting for signal get in. It has low payment than AT&T and is worth your money. They also have helpful customer service who have easy understanding of technology and ready to served you. One phone call and they be here if any trouble at all. Always friendly and have great advice.", "In Florida cable reliability is a challenge, but overall I've been satisfied with Xfinity even in bad weather and heavy rain. The installation of the Xfinity box and system was very easy and was done without a lot of hassle. The workman, however, said he was an independent contractor hired by Comcast to do the install and that bothered me. Don't we pay them enough to have on-staff installers? Plus, what I don't find to be reliable is the customer service. Comcast has absolutely the worst in-person centers and representatives over the phone. I am always surprised that after years of complaints this company has not been able to address the important part of their business. But Xfinity is extremely fast and I haven't had any issues with internet, although one of the Members in my house mentioned that they have difficulty with online gaming.", "The installation went very smooth and quick, which I had no issue with whatsoever. After that, service could have at least been better. There were bad and good times which came with the service. I would get good people but then bad people, it felt like an absolute runaround honestly. I would lose service constantly and it was honestly just tiring, and then I get horrible responses? That's not cool. When I HAD the internet working the speed was phenomenal. And then when it would dip down it just be so darn slow and that made it very hard to really do anything at all, which I hated more than anything.", "Comcast really is a good internet service and the reliability is great. The only thing that I don't like is that it gets too pricey.", "Customer service was hard to get a hold of but were friendly, kind and helpful. I did have to wait on hold every time I called but once I was connected with an employee it was great. The employees were patient and helped me work through minor performance problems. The system was installed quickly and efficiently and was ready to use immediately. The setup was relatively easy and intuitive and the installation manual covered the rest. All the internet connection was fast and reliable and never failed. I never had to worry about the speed of my internet or television connections.", "They are helpful and can help in a small amount of time. They like to help and do anything it takes to be good. I like them a lot and they really are very good to me. They make good Internet and the wifi is good.", "I have had progressively worse and worse internet service in my home. Numerous calls to customer service respond to me with a scripted answer of they see nothing wrong, then cust service does a speed test online to show you that the service is better than normal (this is total joke and not accurate at all). I've spent hours on the phone with customer service complaining. I've had many, many tech service people respond to my home and no one can resolve my problem. \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, upon my renewal of service contract, I was quoted a price for service moving forward and it's 3 months later and I still have not been billed that price. More calls to customer service to try to resolve are useless. Hours upon hours on the phone, no one knows anything. They cannot explain why service is horrible or billing is incorrect and they could care less. I've had promises from customer service reps to have supervisors call me to resolve matters... NO ONE EVER CALLS!! This is the worst run company I have ever done business with and they don't even care. I guess this is what happens when companies get too big. There is a disconnect with the customers and they do not care about your business. I would not recommend this company to an enemy!! My next call is to a State of New Jersey regulatory agency to see if they can help.", "I have the HD Preferred Plus with Xfinity that boasts about their BLAST INTERNET SPEEDS of 200Mps. For the last two weeks, I have been on the phone with numerous Customer Service Representatives, several times with the Advanced Technical teams from Arizona, Alabama, the Pocono Mountains in Pa, have had two service technicians to my home, have traveled 20 some miles to replace the modem, rather than have them ship it for a mere $9.95. With every person that I spoke with, I was told that there is nothing wrong, even though I had my cable checked for strength from the street, along with my house wiring. The signals were great according to the in home techs.\r\n\r\nNow, why I am complaining. I am only receiving 100Mps when it should be 200Mbps. When I run numerous speed tests, my download speed's at in the mid 40's with upload speeds of around 9Mps. Not acceptable to me. After all, I am currently paying more for cable service, than it would cost to provide electric & natural gas to heat my home. Go figure. I am about an inch away from canceling all of Comcast's services, use my cell phone as my home phone, look for another internet supplier, and using a Fire Stick with Kodi installed to watch any program, or movie that I want. Totally free if you didn't know! Since I have had no help with my calls, my next step before I cancel will be to contact a few consumer affairs groups on our local channels in Philadelphia. Maybe they can help?", "When I had Comcast put in, they did not offer appointments that fit my schedule. It took me forever to meet up with a tech to do the initial install because I am on all for work at various hours of the day. It takes forever to get a technician to make a service call. With my work hours it took me 3 weeks to get a service call. The only reason it wasn't longer was that I had the day after Thanksgiving off. You wait forever for a customer service rep and then you can barely understand them. I tried on 2 different occasions where they had to schedule a service call to get help and neither time were they able to help.", "Comcast is the fastest connectivity around. I'm almost always connected, and service is great. Wifi options give you service anywhere there is an Xfinity connection. It's well worth the money. It takes an extremely short time to have them come connect you, and everything needed is included. They have professional and extremely helpful service technicians in the field. They give you an hour window when they'll be there and are punctual. No waiting around all day. They will help with set up and troubleshooting done on premises. Customer service reps will troubleshoot over the phone or send a tech out usually within a day. They are extremely helpful and will walk you through set up and extra options. It was an all around enjoyable, stress free experience. Comcast business may be a hair faster but for the home experience their service cannot be beat.", "Everything was extremely easy to setup by myself, and I am not the most tech savvy person in the world. I love the customer service that they provide, it makes me feel loved and gives me a sense of belonging to the company. Never drops coverage and it has super fast speed, never have had any complaints about it. I love Comcast so much as a company. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for new internet and the fastest speeds.", "I was told there was a charge if I wanted the option of a technician to come to my home and install. I chose to do it myself because I'm already paying them enough for the service. Generally I have had pleasant experiences with the customer service representatives I have dealt with. I have had a few miserable people who don't know what they're talking about but that seems to be rare (because calls are recorded). My internet speed is mostly fast. Sometimes it lags if there are too many people connected on a number of devices. Also slower the farther I get from the modem. But I haven't had any major problems with my internet reliability and when it has not worked, a few times, they're good about fixing it. I do like that I don't have to worry about it not working very often.", "The service I received ordering was very good. They showed up at my house on time. They were efficient in the installation and made sure that I had all my questions answered before leaving. Also, never had a problem using their internet service. It was always fast and reliable. It was able to download all sorts of stuff without waiting, I was able to stream HD movies with no delay at all and surf all the websites I desired.", "Comcast Internet Service is a very unreliable service because of frequent outages and rebooting took forever. Reboots were frequent thus speed was always like quicksand... slow, sloppy, cumbersome. Customer services gives frequent excuses for these outages but it continued to happen. During most calls I would be placed on hold for several minutes (often 10-15 minutes) and then when service person did return would be passed to another representative and sometimes 2 other reps to get goings taken care of. A huge window of time for when the installer would come was unreasonable. The installer showed up 45 minutes after the 6 hrs window of arrival. When he finally was ready to install he had to leave to get supplies he forgot. This was one of the slowest services I've ever encountered.", "My internet speed is fantastic. I never have a problem loading pages and my computer never freezes. I can download things faster than I ever could in the past. I can watch all my favorite tv shows and movies. I'm just thrilled at the amount of money I've saved compared to other services. I always enjoy coming home to my living room now. The installation was quick and easy. They didn't destroy anything and were very polite and courteous. Nothing was done the wrong way, and I didn't have to call them back which was great. Whenever I had problems, which were rare, they always got them cleared up right away. It's very quick and with no hassle at all. I'm very pleased with my service.", "The router kept malfunctioning and I would have to restart it constantly. Besides that I have not had many problems with the Comcast's service. Installation did not involve much from me and it did not take very long. The service representative was efficient. Only qualm is the window of time for arrival they tell you. It could have you waiting around all day. Helpful, courteous representatives when I have called with any issue. Also had a good experience when I needed to pick up a new remote for the cable we have from Comcast as well. The internet speed is pretty good unless I am using my phone to hook up to the Wi-Fi. Sometimes (maybe the reception) is slow. When using the desktop it is faster.", "The installers were very helpful, and they walk me through the whole process. They did not make a mess, drill any unnecessary holes, and very clean. My service is always working correctly, and if there is any problems with the service they are out right away to take care of the problem. I never been unhappy with the service. The speed is awesome too, have never sat around waiting for it to catch up. It has always been working fine and even through bad weather, snow, rain, whatever it is!!! When I call to see what kind of deals were going on at the time customer service were very helpful and didn't try to push any big packages on me, they asked what do I want. They were very helpful and I would recommend to anyone.", "My internet service is always reliable. I rarely ever had a problem with it being unreliable and if I did, it was resolved in a timely manner. The speed is fast for the most part. Every now and then it would run slower than usual but it was still able to get the job done which is the main goal. I would recommend this to a friend. The installation was also quick and done in a timely manner. An employee was able to come out to my residence within a day or two at most. Their customer service is great. If I ever had an issue I was always able to speak to an actual person.", "The service is great. I only had a problem once. My internet went down and I called to let them know. Within half hour it was fixed. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family anytime. Installation was faster than expected. The guy showed up right at the expected time. Had it hooked up within 20 minutes and ready to go. He was very helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and courteous. The customer service is great. They will try to help as much as possible. They too are also very knowledgeable and friendly. They get things done fast. They have my recommendation anytime. I only had one incident with the speed of my internet. I was watching a movie and it just kept buffering. I called to report it and it was fix right away. I think it was a glitch. Other than this time the speed has been fine.", "Xfinity is not always reliable, because sometimes the wifi box goes out and stops sending data. But overall the wifi is ok. I moved to a new place and it took a long time for them to come to the apartment. When the workers came, they were very nice and installed the box. But after a day or so the cable stop working for no reason and the channels would not come in at all. It took a week to have another worker come and fix it. The customer service reps are very helpful. I had a problem with my wifi and cable and nothing I tried would work. So I called them and had my problem fixed in minutes.", "Comcast internet service is mostly reliable. The internet speed is usually good for multiple devices, as well as streaming. Sometimes it slows down, and the router needs to be restarted, but mainly it is fast enough. Signal strength in back of apartment is not very strong. I wish the signal strength was better. Fairly easy to install the router and connect it through the cable wire. I was provided a cable splitter so the cable box and router could both be connected. Customer Service is friendly and mostly helpful, except the biggest issue, which is negotiating with them about package prices. These are too expensive, and so is modem lease. Not happy how inflexible they are now. Customer loyalty doesn't give very good deals any longer.", "The installation was fast and easy. The dude who came to set it up was friendly and professional. He also showed me what to do if I ever had any issues and made it easy for me to understand. They have the BEST customer service. I only had to call a few times in the years I had them, and they always got my issue fixed as quickly as possible, and the people I talked to were very polite. The internet service has a super fast connection and I never had any issues connecting or with the speed of loading websites no matter how many devices I had connected. I never got any error messages while logging onto websites unless the site itself was having an issue.", "The installation went smoothly and the installer was courteous and spent a lot of time doing things right and then took extra time to explain everything. The speed of the service is great when it's available and I always have plenty of data left at a very high speed when I can use it. However, it tends to go out during bad weather. Also, I hate that its connected along with the cable. It's way too expensive and the service is terrible and has never been reliable, lots of outages with no compensation for time lost. I would never use the company again.", "There have only been a handful of times when my internet service went out or was slowed down. Anytime I'm using my internet service with Xfinity, I'm very pleased with both the speed and reliability of their internet. I live in a remote rural area, and although I gave Xfinity my correct address, their professional installers were a day late with installing my service, because my address does not show up on GPS. So in reality, it wasn't their fault. Anytime I've ever needed to contact Xfinity's customer service department, I've always been connected with a friendly, knowledgeable staff member, and my problem has always been resolved in one phone call. The speed of Xfinity's internet service is incredible, and I'm extremely content and satisfied with their internet service as a whole.", "The speed of the service is better than expected and hardly ever lose my connection which is important since I work online a lot. Great service, always reliable and never really had many issues with the service I was provided. Great value for the money. They have many locations also. The installation was quick and painless. Was up in running in just a few minutes. The installer was very friendly and provided good service. The customer service is very good. They always are nice and polite and always help you sort out your issues. Quick and easy and doesn't take much time.", "Comcast is very professional when it comes to installation and the time promised is always perfect. Workmanship is always good and they make sure you are satisfied before leaving. Rarely do I ever have a problem with service and if there is a problem Comcast is usually able to fix the problem within a reasonable amount of time. Comcast customer service is always great. They answer my worries and satisfy my circumstances with superb service. I also never have a problem with my speed as it is always good and more than I need when I am performing work on the internet. Their speed is one of the best in the industry.", "Xfinity has always been reliable. Every time I've had a problem Xfinity has always a promo with a solution. Installation was simple and less expensive than other companies. I received a promotion for free installation so that's great and the service men were also promo and very courteous when installing my cable. The best customer service! Every time I call about anything they are always so nice and helpful. I had a problem with my cable not working, and they explained how to fix the problem over the phone so I didn't pay any extra fees! They also fixed issues over the phone that I'd had with my TV before in under 5 minutes. The speed of the connection from Xfinity is also amazing. I have blazing fast internet which with 4 kids who love to play on their tablets, is a must!", "I was a Comcast customer for 40 years. The equipment was installed and remained at the same address in Hollywood, Florida. The billing address is in Brooklyn, New York and that has remained the same. My family and I are \u201csnowbirds\u201d. Recently I had to extend my \u201cseasonal hold\u201d to include the full 9 months allowed because of surgery. Apparently, it was not extended. But I had no way of know this because Comcast began sending bills to Hollywood, Fla. I could have questioned the incorrect charges had I received an invoice. Because of the Comcast mistake, eventually all services were disconnected, even those provided and paid for through my association. Comcast sent my account out to collection and included penalties for not returning the equipment on an account I never knew was cancelled. \r\n\r\nI was notified by a collection agency while in New York but Comcast had two different account numbers for me so I was unable to access the information. This was in November. When I arrived in December I was told the only way to restore the internet immediately was to put through a full payment. Within 5 days I would get credit for the false charges less the seasonal fee which I owed. I was told my association account for cable and Comcast account for internet had to be separated out by a specialist which would only be approved if I made full payment. These were the words of the billing office who assured me by providing a ticket number of the incident. I wasn\u2019t told the situation had to go before (the incompetent) Resolution Specialists in South Florida or I would never had made a payment. I was confident that a corporation such as yours was giving me valid information. \r\n\r\nFive days later, no credit and another ticket issued. I\u2019m still fighting this. South Florida specialists accused me of lying about the seasonal, lying about the error made in my mailing address (they didn\u2019t even check the records), said no one could give me a credit card refund and argued that seasonal was never allowed for 9 months. Supervisors I spoke with all had different versions of Comcast rules; many didn\u2019t have a clue and when asked to return the call I reached recordings and full mailboxes. This happened 9 times. I called Corporate PA who referred it back to Florida who repeated the same thing. They are not even aware that I returned all equipment 2 months ago. \r\n\r\nI am a handicapped 70 year old and more importantly a customer for 40 years. I was disrespected and disbelieved because I have no proof that I extended seasonal so I must be lying. My 20 year history shows I am in Hollywood maybe 1 month out of 18. Had I been in Florida as I originally planned I would have been without TV and internet until December. This makes no sense. Even when I call before arriving, as instructed, my seasonal is still on and my internet service isn\u2019t put back for 24-48 hours. This time I had a medical emergency and I needed access. That is the only reason I gave my credit card number. The representative also said if a refund couldn\u2019t be given on my American Express, would I accept a check. \r\n\r\nI agreed and asked that the mailing address be returned to the original in New York or I would never get the check. That was done and when the supervisor looked at my account he said I was not being truthful as my billing address was still New York. I am not trying to usurp your company, but I am asking for respect and a full investigation into my claim. Although I most certainly would value a refund more than a corporation with your earnings I wouldn\u2019t have exhausted all this time, energy and resources if it wasn\u2019t important that the truth be told. I feel so unfairly victimized. So I ask you, after you reach that corporate bottom line is there any room left for corporate responsibility?", "Comcast came into the house a little later than schedule and were a bit rough with everything, plus we were having a few problems. They installed it fast and answered the questions we had for them to the best of their ability. However, it was a little delayed and they didn't call us back when we called them. Once we were on the phone, we were able to ask what had to be done and it was good. The speed is good. Fast downloads and uploads. Sometimes the internet goes out and it does come back on for a while and sometimes the service is slow in responding. There are a few issues with the connection from time to time, but that is only in a couple of areas and it is good everywhere else. Overall the service is fast and efficient and it helps me do what I have to do.", "Comcast's Installation was free, but have to pay for the equipment. Contractors left behind somewhat of a mess, but nothing too bad. Comcast does not have many outages. Maybe once a month for less than ten minutes. Other than that it has been ok outside of peak times. Bandwidth is there and speed is decent. Able to stream a movie and browse the internet and/or play a game. Issues are normally resolved quickly when called in to customer support.", "It did not take that long to install and the technician was very polite. He always answered all of my questions and was a very nice and helpful person. Service was reliable most of the time. But there were times it would just cut off. I'd say that only happened maybe 4% of the time. Otherwise it was fine. The speed isn't as fast as I would like for it to be. But I guess it's fast enough to get things done. I just wish they could make it a little bit more faster. Then every time I needed to talk to customer service they were very helpful and they answer all your questions and make sure you are satisfied.", "They have great service and selection with little lag or fuss and confusion. I can get on there quick and secure without any worries or problems and usually have no connection or security issues at all. They have very fast speed compared to the competitors. It remains fast regardless how many people are using it. They keep up with everyone and what they are doing. The installation is very easy and simple. I can basically do it myself and have a support person on the phone to help you step by step through the process. The customer service is amazing. There's always a free person to talk to whenever you need to talk. Also, they always have useful advice and always help with whatever issue I may need and they do it quickly to get me on my way.", "Comcast works just fine if I'm the only one home. Then I have my phone connected and usually the TV watching Netflix. But as soon as my husband gets home and hooks up his laptop and phone, it starts getting slower. Our Netflix is slower and the internet on both of our phones is slower as well.", "The installation was very quick and easy to set up. The instructions given were very clear and helpful, and the customer service team was quite friendly and efficient. I was able to get connected very quickly. The Xfinity team always helped me with whatever issues I happened to be having, and provided service with a personal touch. I felt that they were very accommodating, as well as knowledgeable, and helped resolve the problems in a speedy manner. Xfinity was usually quite reliable and fast for me. When a problem did arise, customer service was able to fix it quickly. I was happy with my purchase and it helped me stay connected at all times. The speed was great. I was always able to maintain a fast connection and stream movies and TV shows with no buffering issues. I was very happy with my ability to maintain a quick and efficient connection at home.", "Installation is quick and easy and all info is explained along with all options. The best service, always available, kind to their customers and willing to help every time you need them. I like using this service because you get an hour free each month and it's the only one I know that does that. Also, it is reliable wherever I go and is always fast and up to date. Service is great and dependable. I would highly recommend this service to anyone with an honest smile.", "Comcast provided great service when they came to install my internet service. The provider was kind and courteous and helpful. It is reliable and I get excellent internet coverage with them. It is really fast with everything that we have connected to it and hardly ever lags. Everyone can use it at the same time without any problems. Every time I have had to contact them with any issue, they have been so kind and helpful. Also, everything gets resolved quickly and effectively.", "Their installer was very nice and polite and had been respectful with the service. The person is very knowledgeable about the services and providing installations about the services. The person explained very well the information about the services and what is included. The person did his job in a timely manner and quick with the services. I was pleased with the speed of the installation of the service.\r\n\r\nComcast's internet service was wonderful and very useful. I understand the quality of the website and services. You can go through different sites to get internet information. They also have a great customer service with excellent communication with the customer. They are knowledgeable about the products and the services that come with the company.", "Compared to the Windstream service I am forced to use now, Comcast was amazing, and so was the price. They say you don't know what you've got until it's gone, and it is quite accurate in this case. The initial call for setup was smooth and installation was Very easy and efficient, and the technician actually showed up when they said they would. I was pleasantly surprised.", "My internet always ran, I never experienced any sort of issue with my ISP! And when I'd call for help, they were all so very helpful and resolved all of my needs! Very much recommend their customer service line. All reps were so very friendly and answered all my concerns and I didn't have to wait very long to speak to a rep! All answers were well versed! During the installation, the gentleman who came out was very friendly. He explained each of the steps he was doing so I'd understand cause I'm not the most well-versed person with technology. My Internet speed is so incredibly fast. I read reviews online and was kinda skeptical at first but they won me over. And my internet is so much faster now than my old provider, highly recommended! Loved it very much!", "It has been years since Comcast installed our system, but they did a good job. They came when they said they would be here and were efficient. The speed of  internet is very reliable and quick. The internet rarely goes out, however when it does it tends to be for a few hours and when you call them, they overestimate the time that it will take to get it fixed. I find their customer service to be horrendous. Once when I called to let them know the internet was out in my area, since Comcast has a monopoly, they gave me all sorts of tasks to do on my part rather than saying it could possibly be their fault, I finally hung up on them and called a neighbor who said their internet was out also and called back.", "Installation was pretty simple. It actually guide you through it all and it's very convenient. All motion not too much difficulty. Dealing with the speed is awesome. Not once did it skip or frozed. You can't lose. I actually recommend. You can rely on Comcast because its Internet speed is very sufficient. It also have linking channels that most Internet providers don't include. Sometimes when trying to get service, it may take the voice recording promo a couple of minutes to come on... Nonetheless, it's not every time.", "We installed the service ourself but was on the phone with someone from Comcast and it was a normal experience. The internet speed is okay sometime soon it'll go fast or slow on my phone and pad or the other consoles like PlayStation or Xbox. But overall speed is depending on what you have and pay for. I've had few problems with this service provider before of it being with the connection and when the wifi would go in and out of working altogether. Customer service is okay. I've had trouble when trying to communicate or get a hold of one of them. I've asked for help and some do provide what I'm looking for, although sometimes it get stuck complicated.", "The Internet speed is enough for the 5 of us to use it and still have decent download speeds but sometimes it has trouble when we are streaming through the Kindle fire stick. The service is mostly reliable but when it does go down it is hard to get someone to fix it. Also the billing has been incorrect multiple times, they always fix it but it is a hassle. For the installation, they came out and set it up quickly and made sure it was working. In general their service people are very nice and do a good job. However, hard to get anyone on the phone that speaks English well and often it takes multiple calls to resolve a simple issue. If you go to the store it is even worse and you will wait hours.", "Xfinity internet is fast and pretty reliable. My Netflix freezes up sometimes, but I don't know if that's the internet or the app itself. The two guys that installed my Xfinity service were very nice and professional. They asked questions about what I preferred, and showed me how to work everything. I had a lot of issues money wise at first but the customer service I received was very helpful, and professional and the problem was handled very well.", "The guy that came out and walked me through the installation was great. He explained before and while doing things. No BS. Told me what to do to change password and where to go on website if I needed to troubleshoot. Internet speed could be faster but that's more money. Otherwise it's good. Just having some trouble lately with wifi not good enough for a tower, a laptop and 2 phones. Phones get no service sometimes. They want me to upgrade and pay more to fix problems. Have a gamer at home who needs high speed but not sure for 20 more it's worth it. I also had problems with a service which I no longer wanted that they kept renewing for three months. Was getting charged and they had to credit my bill the next month.", "Comcast's reliability is very good. The speed is fantastic. It's great to use and saves time with its fast loading. When I want to go online shopping or play online games, I don't really need to worry about bugs or lag. My installation experience with Comcast was great. I'd recommend it to lots of people, especially those who go on the Internet a lot, watch movies, etc.", "Comcast Internet Service has great variety of shows, no down time, and good customer service. Xfinity customer service is available 24 hours, they are quick to solve any problem that may accrue. The price are lower the other services. I like the bundle packages. Xfinity service installation was quick and easy. It was a positive experience, all connection with without any discomfort to us. Activation was quick and no extra wiring to our home was needed. Xfinity internet service is speedy, downloads up to 10 mbps. It's clear and concise. Xfinity deliver fast internet access to hot spot nationwide. WiFi is also fast. Xfinity does not have a problem with shutdown or blackouts, I enjoy the ability of getting on quickly out of a long waiting time.", "The speed is great. It is fast with more than one phone and a computer on it at the same time and we have not many problems. It's very good all the time. People should look in to it. The Internet cost a lot but what does not this days. The customer service was very nice. They knew how to solve my problem and help me with it. The installers were nice, knew what they were doing and did not take a whole lot of time.", "I moved to the area about 6 mos ago. There are not many other companies in my area so I had to go with what was available. So far the services is pretty good. To improve they can provide fiber optic cable for faster internet speed.", "The reliability of Xfinity's services are unmatched and the strength of the signal makes for good quality programming. Xfinity allows for programming on-demand. When my services were installed, the technician possessed an unprecedented reservoir of knowledge and enlightened me of imperative tips on how to get the most optimal viewing experience. \r\n\r\nAlso, the customer service facilitated via Xfinity were highly assistive in promoting alleviating any complications I may have endured with my service. They were highly versed in the department with an overall optimistic and willful disposition genuinely available to assist the customer. In juxtaposition to the other services, the speed of Xfinity is of excellent sufficiency as it is reliable. My internet usage is undoubtedly more of an enjoyable experience, chiefly with website browsing and downloading hefty documents. My download speeds are unprecedented.", "Installation took several weeks due to inadequate customer service. We were double charged for a router because Comcast both had us pick one up and then sent us one. We were told different installation dates. On the plus side, the installing technician was incredibly nice and accommodating. It's difficult to get a hold of someone who can help you, and it seems like when I have an issue that takes more than one call to resolve, my information isn't saved between calls. Reps seem to not be very knowledgeable, and also seem to be salespeople. Internet frequently goes out, is slow in my home, usually at night, when I pay for the fastest package. Only redeeming factor is that there are almost never lengthy outages. I work evenings, so this is the time I'm online so it can be frustrating. Nothing too terrible though.", "The installation was super easy and simple. There was nothing complicated with it and the setup went very well. No stress and reliable. Their customer service was also helpful when calling with technical difficulties and did not have any issues with the service they gave. I could understand every word spoken. It was also fast and the interaction was Professional. Also, the internet speed has never let me down unless you got a different kind of plan. But the speed is very fast and top quality and is very relaxing with no issues.", "My provider installed the internet service for my girlfriend as at the time, I was at work. But when I came home she knew how to install it. Comcast internet service is very reliable, I never got bumped and it was always fast, no matter what... We had a bad snowstorm one day and it seemed like it worked even better, always up for the challenge. I also never have to wait, I have had 5 windows opened at once and it didn't matter. When I download stuff it's done in record fashion. So far, I had to contact their customer service twice and was never on hold more than 2-3 minutes and always received a follow-up call to see if I was happy with service.", "The internet is always working. I don't think it compares to other internet providers in the area. We never have an issue with connectivity and the speed is very fast. It is rated at 217 MBPS and we never have issues searching the web or completing our work online. It is easily installed by a technician and they set it up very quickly. We are taught how to connect to the internet and which WIFI signal to use and make secure in our home. It is secure as well as dependable. Moreover, we have rarely had an issue with Comcast Customer Service. They are very helpful and knowledgeable online and when we make a phone call. If there is an issue it is quickly resolved. We spread the word about the good service we receive with Comcast. We are happy to use this reliable service.", "I'm satisfied with speed for the most part. I stream a lot of my favorite shows and YouTube videos as well as Facebook Live. Sometimes on Facebook it's a little slower but it was not the Internet service it was Facebook. Installation was really easy. The company sent me a box and I had it all put together in 10 minutes myself and I was enjoying my cable and internet service. However, I had long waits on the phone to get a hold of people at Xfinity. I had an experience with a rude representative, this was in the Dearborn office. But once that was taken care of the service after that was pretty good and the internet is as reliable.", "Comcast service never seems to go out because of bad weather or anything else. The internet speeds are fast and always reliable and never seem to be any issues. We needed up doing the installation all by ourselves. All the equipment came with very detailed instructions that were easy to follow and made it easier and more convenient than having to get it professionally installed. Anytime I have ever had to call customer service the wait times are usually very short. Their customer service reps are always very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting me with my needs. I have never had issues in the 2 years of service with Comcast to experience slow internet speed. Everything downloads quickly and service is never interrupted. I think their speeds are better than most. Overall I would recommend them to anyone.", "The installation was very easy, it was very self-explanatory. However, I don't like the service as they don't work half the time. Customer service is awful. Nobody can speak English and when you ask for help they say that they're going to help you and then they never do. So I'm not a fan of the customer service at all. When it works the speed is fine, but most of the time there is no speed when it comes to using the internet here. It sucks really bad. I will not be using the company we have if there was another company to get internet from.", "Speed is fast, we have never had any issues of it being slow and that is awesome. We have used other providers before and Verizon is the fastest system we have used in a long time. Very good with installation, we have never had any issues and I love how easy it is. We are always happy with what comes along with Verizon. Very worth it. They're also very reliable. When we have any issues they are great when it comes to calling and trying to figure out what is wrong. Customer service is AWESOME! If we have any problems they always are there to help us at any time, always answer phone calls. They do their best to help us no matter what our circumstances are and if they don't know what is wrong they help us in any way possible.", "Comcast Internet Service has not gave me much problems getting on or staying on. It runs fairly fast and have not had many interruptions when there was a storm or anything else. It was easy install and was able to do it myself in very little time. If you have any questions there was someone available to walk you through it. Their customer service always works to better assist you in any matter. They work fast to address your concerns if you have any and they have quick and friendly people and eager to help at all times. Never really had any problems with the speed. It is always on point and even if you're pretty far from the modem it is still really fast in picking up.", "It's a great service and they have reasonable plans and the personalized channel selection, sometimes the signal is really bad but I understand that everyone else is using all the same services as well. The speed of the process was fairly easy and was done in great timing. The people was nice as well and they never put me on hold. Everything was great with the representative. She was nice and knew what she was talking about. Loved the great customer services much live action. But the man who installed it was late and he was weirdly dressed and was very rude. I would have loved to know more but he acted like he didn't wanna be here.", "Comcast internet service was good when we had it. I installed it in our place by myself and activating it was very easy to do my mom could do it. They sent the easy-to-follow instructions. I try fixing issues on my own before calling Customer Service but when I did I found them very nice and able to fix the issue. We did have issue with the wireless not getting to all of the rooms in my 3 bedroom apartment so most of the time my daughter didn't have internet in her room. Prices were too high, too. I don't like how they charge now for even more than they should per usage. However, I don't remember having too many issues with their service.", "The installation was done very well. The customer service is fast and easy to do. Also, I'm very satisfied with the speed and it works very well. No problems. There's nothing that I didn't like about it and I wouldn't want it any other way, that's for sure. I would suggest it to all my family and friends because of the service and because it does work.", "Comcast Internet Service works fine as long as you pay your bill before the due date. If not they will start slowing your Internet connection. So it takes longer to do everything. They also do this thing where they bill you twice which means say your bill is due the 29th of this month, well before the 29th they will bill you again for the month after that so it causes you to have two bills due. But the installation was very easy. They came out and installed for us. The people were very polite. They didn't take too long and they came at a reasonable time. Customer service is okay. Sometimes you get rude people with a really bad attitude. Other days you get really nice people. I've only had to call once or twice.", "The provider I use Infinity/Comcast has been around for years and stays in business for giving me what I have asked for with my services, whether the service just be internet, or cable and internet. They have good coverage and signal. The installation took little time and soon I was on the internet able to stream my Netflix and have access to my friends and family online. They said they would be here and they were here. The few times I had service troubles the customer service person that helped me knew what department I needed to talk to get my services up and running fast. It has the speed I would come to expect from the company as a whole. They have been providing services for over thirty years. When they said \"fast service\" they delivered on their word/reputation.", "The employee came over and installed the internet service in about 3 to five minutes. It was very quick and I could've done it myself. The speed of Comcast's Internet was more than quick. It allowed all of our devices to connect and operate quickly and it downloaded multiple things quicker. I had Bright House before and this is faster. Going over the allowed usage made it extremely slow. My overall experience with this Internet provider is as shows. I just wouldn't recommend if you have a big family like I do and can't afford the biggest offer they have. But if you have one or two of you that will use it, it will be perfect. It's quick and reliable. Works faster than my 4G.", "Few interruptions, service restored quickly when it does go out. Very quick service, much quicker than a lot of other companies we've used in the past. Don't have to worry that it's going lag even with multiple devices. It holds up pretty well. Overall, satisfied although I pretty much installed it myself. Had a little trouble but serviceman was able to correct it fairly quickly.", "The service installation was quick, friendly, timely & knowledgeable. But that was the ONLY time that the company was timely. And Comcast charges FAR too much for their services. The only thing consistent about Comcast's internet service was its lack of reliability. If there was a service outage, they couldn't provide you with an estimated restoration time, like they say they will. Or, if you needed a tech to come to your house, it was rarely within the stated timeframe. Also, out of ALL the Customer Service experiences I had with Comcast, NOT ONE was handled in a satisfactory or timely manner! Comcast is good at the old \"Bait & Switch\" too.", "We have good reception and clear picture and sound on our tv and devices. It's very easy to use their friendly customer service and to pay our bills. Installation was a great experience! The technician showed up on time, was really nice and explained how to use the remote. He made sure our devices were connected too. Customer service is very friendly. When we called them once, they stayed on the phone to troubleshoot and corrected the situation quickly. Our Internet speed is great. Our downloads lead quickly and there is very seldom buffering. I click on something and it works easily.", "It was very reliable and was very useful. I like how it had many channels to listen to and I like it felt like a new adventure each time I rode in my car. Installation was really good. The speed was fine. It ran really fast and it took me to the websites in seconds. I felt like it was a great experience. The customer service was just fine. I never had to call them because the service ran like it should had.", "It took a little longer to get set up than we were hoping, and we did have to have the installers come back once to fix a problem. They did, however, respond to our call immediately and the technician who came out was able to fix the problem right away. Our Internet speed is faster than all of our friends. I almost never have to wait for a site response to load, even with complex illustrations. Searches are performed instantly. It's much better than I expected it to be. Anytime we have had a problem with our service, we have called them. If they couldn't fix it right away, which they usually did, they would give us regular status reports on progress. We have had great experience with customers service. They are friendly and professional and can usually resolve any issues we have over the phone. If there is an outage, they keep in touch about when service will be restored.", "Comcast has high speed data without slowing down and no buffering. The speed is an unbeatable high data plan on any device. It also lets you use multiple devices. It's very dependable compared to Dish and AT&T. The installers are also very courteous, friendly, professional, and helpful at answering any questions you might have and personally showing you how work the devices. And when I call customer service they are very friendly, asks how you are, helps with all questions and troubleshooting problems wirelessly, guides you through purchases as well. I would recommend Xfinity to my friends and family.", "Comcast was a good service provider. We had cable and internet. I'd only recommend this service because it can usually connect everywhere. All the people who use Xfinity make this possible. The installation for Xfinity was a simple process. The guy came in and fixed up the cords. The customer service was typical of your average customer service. It was a run-of-the-mill service, nothing out of the ordinary. The operatives were good in their job. I never had that big a problem with them. The internet speed could use some help because it was like a on-and-off type thing. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't.", "I have only been alive for about 16 years and let me tell you; this is the ** internet I've ever experienced. My parents say that this is the best internet they could get in the area, which is unbelievable as it is almost impossible for me to even imagine internet worse than this. It cannot handle more than three people using it at a time without being complete **. If you're the only one using it in the house, it's just decent. My computer is hardwired to the internet via Ethernet cable and I get 100+ ping when I'm playing a game on a good day. I cannot believe that Comcast isn't bankrupt yet, even though it's what everyone uses around here. That being said, don't move to Beaufort, South Carolina if you care even slightly about having acceptable internet.", "After a bust trying to get AT&T services at my home, I tried Comcast even though they had less than stellar reviews in my area. Contacted chat line asking questions for TV, internet, and phone service. I told the rep that it was very important to me for everything to be revealed up front and honestly. I hate \"oh by the ways,\" at the end of a conversation. I have dealt with hidden costs and sneaky business deals. I was super careful about my questions and clarifying answers. I think these reps are trained on how to be vague. Some questions I had to clarify many times because she wouldn't give me a clear answer. I do not trust people who try to hang you up on fine details. I was super clear about my intentions and what was important to me. \r\n\r\nAfter being cut-off the chat twice and three different reps and two and a half hours later, I finally felt I could move forward on my choices. Wouldn't you know it, she hit me in the final step of the deal \"oh, by the way, there is also a $10 charge per month for the modem.\" I was through by then. I reiterated that being honest and up front with customers was important to me and I had voiced that concern. She then came back that since she hadn't been totally upfront, they would waive the installation charges which were $60. Nope, not enough because the unheard charges were $120 and that she wasn't giving me anything that had not been advertised to the public in the way of advertising. She said she couldn't do anything for me. \r\n\r\nWhere has honesty and upfront communication gone in the customer service industry? Especially since I pointed it out all along. After a fiasco with AT&T and now Comcast, I don't have anywhere else to go to get needed services. Am I going to have to settle for high-cost services and poor customer service? What is the answer? Anyone know of another place to go in Hendersonville, TN for these things?", "Comcast, in our area, as in many, has a franchise monopoly. That is, the local government subsidized Comcast's building of internet infrastructure (laying of cables in public eminent domain areas) and restricted the access rights of competitors to lay cables in those areas. Thus, I have no choice but to depend upon Comcast for broadband internet service. There is no competitive pressure encouraging Comcast to provide superior customer service.\r\n\r\nComcast has seriously failed in at least three arenas for us, and as shown on many reviews nationwide, you may see this applies to other customers as well. (1) Comcast advertises, for our service tier, a service speed of 100 Mbps. We receive consistently a speed merely of about 30 Mbps. A substantial difference. (2) Our initial cable TV contract (bundled with internet) listed a set of stations with our service tier. Monthly, with our bill, we often see a station or two moved to a higher (i.e., more expensive) service tier. (I reckon it's the old TOS ploy, \"These Terms may change at any time for any reason.\")\r\n\r\n(3) Comcast does not offer an opt-out for monitoring and gathering information on our TV and internet activity for commercial (or other) purposes. When I asked a chat agent for a method to opt out, the agent directed me to a phone number. I called, and the robot directed me to yet another phone number. I called that phone number, and the robot did not respond to any of my reactions. I tried three times, with the same results. No opt-out available. I deem Comcast's customer service arrogant and deplorable at best.", "I am happy to see that the people that come to install the box are nice and kind to me and actually tell me what to do and answers questions. I am also happy with the people on customer service because they replied and don't have to wait more than 5 minutes to answer my questions and I am also happy to talk to them. I am happy but not that happy with the speed it has. They go fastest than any other internet speed but sometimes I think I even needs more speed on the Internet and have more WiFi to contact.", "Comcast's reliability is pretty comparable. It doesn't go out often, but when it does, it's usually back up in no time. All I usually do is unplug to router for about thirty seconds, plug it back in and it seems to be back to normal! When we got it installed 10 months ago, the technician was EXTREMELY friendly. He was polite and knowledgeable about the product. I've always heard they have really bad customer service, but we've rarely ever had to call them. And when we did they were nice and helpful. This is the only provider for our rural area but I don't have a problem with the speed though it also depends on how many devices are hooked up.", "Comcast Internet Service was the best experience that I have ever had with a service. I would definitely recommend this to everyone that would want to experience it. The installation was the best that I could have ever experienced. I can honestly say the customer service is the best yet. The speed amazing. It is more than ever expected. We should all want to try this.", "The internet speed is super excellent and it offers many different package options. However, I wish the speed was a little faster for all the things that I use it. Overall it works ok but not where it be better for all my daily tasks need. Prompt service was my key decision to choose this company. Very quick installation and no issues setting it up. Staff was very knowledgeable about what he was doing, was quick, and in and out. I am very super proud of this company. Customer service was great. They were very helpful and answered any and all questions/concerns that I had for them.", "The guy who did the install was nice enough. He was respectful and seemed to know what he was doing. That was the best interaction with the company by far. Their customer service needs work as CSRs are distant, lack knowledge and sound like it's an inconvenience to speak with you. Unfortunately, I loathe speaking with them so much, I avoid it at all cost.\r\n\r\nThe internet service is slow, inconsistent and if weather is bad, shotty service. This is difficult when you want to use multimedia. When more than one device is connected, lots of buffering as well as loading. Playing online games cannot be done simultaneously with watching movies or videos. The speed is not existent. I use phone data instead of my weak wifi.", "The internet is always working very efficiently and is always fast. All of my family can be on it and it still keeps its fast speed. Also, there are rarely any difficulties. It has a decent range, could be better. I am very happy with this. It was pretty easy to get installed in our house. We had to move it once, but that was because the signal didn't do well through many walls. They were very kind and helpful when installing it. In addition, everyone at customer service is very friendly. They always do their best to help as quickly and efficiently as possible. All issues have been resolved and there is no issues that have been prolonged.", "The boxes are easily installed unlike some companies so that's a plus but their devices seem to have lots of problems I had to trade in mine several times. Xfinity definitely has some quick speed but there's some refreshing as you would expect from any service provider but speed is one aspect I was happy with. It is definitely reliable service but they are not good in the customer service department at all. They don't care much about their customers and that's what we rely on. They are rude and don't know how to help us or even understand us when we call.", "I needed a lot of help with things that I didn't know. However to manage I didn't know what or if I could get the help I needed and they were able to help with all my needs. They've been very reliable and I haven't had any problems with their installments at all. I am very pleased with how thoroughly and fast they have been with all the time to manage the help of things.", "This is one of the most reliable networks out there that you can have right now with the number of connected wireless phones and devices in the household. I'm satisfied with the way the cable guy installed my system. I don't believe he could have done a greater job than he has already done. I appreciate it. Their customer service support area and call center is very tremendous and outstanding. They deliver what they promise and never let you down in any situation. The internet speed links back to the number of devices connected within the household which is why I rely on their high speed internet to meet my requirements.", "Comcast Internet Service works even in inclement weather, snow, storms, heavy wind with very few issues with connection and speed. They have extremely fast connection with no problem moving from page to page or opening multiple windows at once. There were no outages even during heavy use with other electronic devices being used at the same time. Called and asked for a specific day for installation and the installers were able to be there on time. They were extremely friendly, courteous and explained any questions we had. He even called back to see if we had any issues a week after installing. Their customer service are okay, but can be rude at times depending on who answers the phone. I've had very nice, helpful, courteous CSRs, but I've also dealt with rude, hateful, spiteful ones, also who need a job other than being a CSR.", "The installation was quick and easy to install and they were good at being on time for installation services. But my internet's upload speeds are horrible. It sometimes takes an hour or two to upload a 3-5 minute video. Their service has quite a few days with outages but the download is decent depending on the package. When using a lot of devices you have to spend a whole lot to get reliable speeds. The weather seems to affect them and the router needs to be reset often. The dual modems don't seem to hold up well. It definitely seems like the equipment is not as reliable as some other's equipment. In addition, their customer service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you get someone who really understand and tries to help, other times not so much. Sometimes, it can have long waits and the automated system to get to CS is not that great.", "TV and internet constantly were going out. The customer service reps were not helpful in correcting the issue and acted like you should be thanking them when you are the one who pays for their service. They are the rudest I've ever encountered. Scheduling someone to come to install was a pain. The installation guy was nice but the cost of installation was ridiculous. Cost more than three months of service. The speed is pretty good. Although you can get better speed if you pay an even higher price.", "Most of the time, the service is reliable but sometimes it's not and that can be really frustrating but they make sure to get it done quick most of the time. Installation was easy and faster than I expected. The service man was in and out, was nice and friendly, and made me feel comfortable. Plus, the customer service is good to the customers, but the bill amount I am not too happy with. My internet speed is okay for now... it's all I can afford for now. It could be a lot better, but then I would have to pay more.", "The service rep that visited our home came on a holiday and was friendly and knowledgeable. Installed the service very quickly and did it with a smile. However, the customer service team that I have spoke to at Xfinity has not been at all helpful. When I have called them they always seem to be from outside of the country with poor English. They have not been able to correct my problem. Plus, my Xfinity internet connection is extremely slow. Does not matter if I am connected via Ethernet cable or wifi it is always very slow. They have not been able to correct and I am very disappointed. Nevertheless, my internet connectivity from Xfinity is always available, always on no matter the weather. Very reliable and I satisfied.", "Installation professional was very respectful and installed equipment where we wanted it even though some areas were difficult to reach. However, the internet will unexplainably reset itself after modem has been replaced and lines tested. But when the wireless internet is working the speed is unbeatable. It is the service outages that make the internet unreliable. There are also many service outages that take hours to resolve. An ethernet connection usually resolves most problems. However, their customer service has been rude and not helpful. We have been promised credits on our bill but credits were never processed. We have to contact supervisors to get the slightest progress on our service problems.", "The internet was reliable. It did the job I had hoped and I wasn't expecting it to be as fast or efficient as was lead to believe but I was pleasantly surprised. The installation was quicker than I expected with little or no problems encountered. I had talked with someone who had it before so it was no problem. Setup was the same, too. The customer service people I encountered were helpful and made it easy to go through the installation process. They were quick, easy to deal with and to the point. Internet speed didn't seem to take longer than thirty minutes start to finish but it was smooth and to the precise point that I needed to do.", "Comcast internet service is fun, easy and affordable. The reliability of the company is pretty good. So far there hasn't been a big issue with their service and its reliability. The company itself is a good company that offers good balance between its products and their prices vary, and they work with their customers to ensure a great service. The speed is okay. But considering where I stay I don't expect much. But it is fast to where I need to get work done around the house or whenever I want to watch new movies or a major sports event.\r\n\r\nThe installation process was ok. The installer was like 10 minutes late only because he turned on wrong road with a similar name to my address, but he was very apologetic about it. He helped me understand what he was doing and didn't leave until he was sure I was comfortable with the service. Customer service is good. Of course there is always a certain wait time with any customer service. But all in all I have no issues with their service. Whenever one representative couldn't help me with an issue another one tried.", "The installation was a bit long and challenging but at the end of the day I give it a good rating. They could of made less steps and wires to install. But I love their customer support because you can contact with them via phone, text, internet or chat. I would make my customer service the same way. Comcast has the fastest speed I have ever seen and I don't think it will ever be passed and it's probably only going to get faster. I would love to see what they are doing. Also, the security is very secure and I'm not worried about being hacked. I would highly recommend it to a friend. I would start a ISP just like this one because it has everything I want in it.", "The customer service of Comcast is reliable and special. Their reps are always professional, knowledgeable and more than willing to help any way possible. They will go out of their way to provide solutions to your problem should one arise. You can always rely on their internet connection and speed. If there has been a outage of service, they will offer another service to make up for the down time. Also, if something is not right with the internet speed, Customer Service is able to work with you to improve it by suggesting different solutions. The techs always keep their appointment times for the installation and if there is a delay, you are notified of it. The installation was completed in a timely manner and before leaving, ask if I had any questions.", "Our Comcast internet service is spotty and extremely slow. Speed is the worst problem! The bandwidth is very thin and it takes a long time to download or upload anything. I wish it would work faster!! Sometimes it stops in the middle of an episode. When more than one of us it trying to watch Netflix, it doesn't work at all. We are often very frustrated with it. When I am trying to upload a video for grad school it takes about 20 hours to upload, and this is not an exaggeration. I was not home when they installed it. My brother was the one who was home and he said the guy put it in and there was no trouble. My brother works on computers and have made some adjustments which have helped a little but it's still annoying. Furthermore, their Customer Service can't help! Every time we call they either do not know what they are supposed to be doing or they are not sure how to handle it. When they do seem competent, they still don't help.", "It took the Comcast service technicians a very short time to hook everything up. The setup appointment was scheduled at my convenience. We were given a three hour window to choose the time we wanted them to come and set us up and they were here on time. Then, I have never had any problems with the reliability. The service was never offline due to technical difficulties. I know with some service providers if there's bad weather your service will be interrupted. I never had to worry about anything like that with Comcast. Also, the connection speed was unbelievable and I had no problems surfing the internet. Everything on the internet loaded fast and I didn't have to wait forever for pages to download like you have to with some companies. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I never had to reach their customer service for anything that anyone who worked for the company had done wrong. I only had interaction with them one time that I can remember when a piece of equipment had broken and they told me to bring it in for a replacement. When I arrived home to install it they stayed on the phone with me until it was completely set up to my satisfaction.", "Never had any problems. It always worked. That is reliable to me if I never had any problems. The service is fast, safe and secure. I would recommend this to all my friends and family. The installation is very easy. They turn it on, you set up the receiver, and connect your devices. Always make sure to create a password to keep yourself safer.\r\n\r\nI never had any bad Customer service. They are always happy to assist you. If there is a problem they will do everything they can to solve the problem. They really want to keep you as a customer. The speed is very fast and reliable. You can do anything and everything you want with Xfinity. Browsing, gaming, streaming music and videos and shopping all at once and your speed will remain quick.", "We were actually pretty pleased with the installation. The service tech was on time and even called to let us know when he would be there. He was very professional yet friendly. He did what he had to do in a reasonable and made sure we were comfortable with using all the equipment before he left. But it seems anytime I would call with a concern I would end up with a tech that I either couldn't understand or just wouldn't listen to my concerns. I felt that the person was given a set of general answers that they referred to and they stuck to it. I always ended up more frustrated than what the original issue even called for.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the internet actually almost made up for the customer service. All downloads went quickly whether it was a movie or software it seemed to be done in seconds. We watch a lot of inline streaming entertainment and never had to worry about unnecessary waiting while the show buffered or would catch up. Always fast no matter the amount of usage, reliable and rarely any interruptions.", "I do not like the installation because it is mostly do-it-yourself installation unless there is some addition wiring (in-house or outside) necessary. I prefer to have service techs install and get me going. Service is fairly steady with infrequent service interruptions. Home service calls are guaranteed to arrive within a certain time period and if not you will be compensated. However, customer service is slow. Even when I go in-store, I find the waits long, long, long. Telephone service often is either out of state or worse yet out of the country. \r\n\r\nIn the latter case, you end up getting someone who has trouble understanding you and you have trouble understanding them and also dealing with their accent. If you request someone in the USA, you end up getting disconnected when your call is supposedly being transferred. Speed tends to be slow too. Do not know if there are tiered speed plans or not but I do not need nor can I fit business rates into my budget.", "Comcast internet service was as good as can be expected. However, it disconnected a lot. Their service sucks. It was really hard to get anybody on the phone and it took about probably 30 minutes waiting for them to get on the phone. But if you could have a good somebody on the phone they're very friendly and they do try to help. They will give you all the information you request. They will tell you everything you need to know. They will try to walk you through many different steps of how to fix it, and they will even send a technician out and fix it.\r\n\r\nInstallation was the very next morning. It got set up. Guy was very helpful, informative and friendly. He said it up, make sure all the wires were headed, but nothing showed us how to set up on a password and usernames. Nevertheless, the speed was great when it works. My videos played very, very well. I could run my TV off of it. My tablet, my games and my phone's all the same time and it would never hesitate.", "Ordered internet service, doesn't work. Get a tech to come out after 3 weeks of waiting - he doesn't bring EQUIPMENT; says he needs to reschedule but they can't until next week. No. They're prolonging my 30-day window to cancel. Yeah right Comcast. I'm on the phone right now and have been for 15 minutes waiting for the agent to find a technician who will come, of course, now when I'm at work because when I had taken the time to wait this morning the incompetent tech couldn't help.", "Blame the customer, always say the problem is at customer end. I had to spend 2 hours on 2 different days to finally argue that the problem was in their data. They promised to refund me money for my inconvenience and lost working time. I have so far not seen the refunds in my bill. When I contacted them on a chat session, the lady had no clue or info about the case history!! NO REFUND AS PROMISED.", "Thank you Comcast for raising my monthly Xfinity WIFI bill by almost $30 a month with not notice. The \"extra fast\" WIFI plan I'm on is not even much faster than any normal WIFI plan and I am now paying an outrageous $98 bill just for WIFI service. That's not a great way of making your customers loyal or happy. I'm very disappointed with this service.", "Horrible. It started with speaking to a sales associate at Walmart who offered me everything I had with Charter for almost half the price. I was hesitant because I've dealt with Comcast raising prices before, but I agreed for her to text me all the details before signing up. Never received a call or text. Next thing I know there's a box of equipment and a bill at my front door. I call to as what it's about and they tell me she signed me up already, that the internet was less than half the speed she promised and just basic cable.\r\n\r\nI talk to the associate on the phone trying to figure out what to do. She was great and tried everything to get the price reasonable. She was able to get everything down to two dollars more than I'm paying with Charter but gave me Starz as compensation. So, I go to hook everything up and it doesn't work. I call and explain the situation. Go through the whole restarting modem ordeal and finally get told I need a tech to come hook it up which BTW will be $60. I ask if they will waive it for all my troubles and I get a big NO. Needless to say I canceled right there.", "I called to let Comcast know that we were shopping around since their services have been extremely unsatisfactory for the past 4 months; this includes multiple blackouts in a single day and horrible television signal even after they put new cables inside and outside the home and forced us to get a new router since all the troubles they said we had was due to our router which is false. I spoke with a man named Omar on 03/19/2017 around 1:45 P.M. and he said they would lower my total bill to $64.99 for 12 months. I advise him I would call him tomorrow since I was still calling other companies. I called the next day and somehow the price is not and is actually more because that was the price that didn't include taxes. This brings me to a point that just because you don't tell people the truth about a cost doesn't mean you didn't lie. How hard would it have been to say it's $64.00 PLUS TAXES which was never said on their \"recorded\" line. \r\n\r\nOn that very day, I speak with another agent Carmelita and is extremely rude and unprofessional that I request a supervisor since she can't tell me what the agent I spoke to before put in the account regarding the retention offer. She then tells me that the average wait time for a supervisor is 25 minutes and decides to wait 30 minutes on the line for a supervisor. I decided to have them give me a call to discuss this deceit of the price and terrible lack of customer service from the last agent. \r\n\r\nAbout 2-3 hours later, I received a call that rang just once and quickly disconnected. That was probably the supervisor/manager calling me waiting for the call to ring once and hang up just to say they called me. If this isn't the dirtiest most deceitful company in the US I don't know what is. I can't wait for Verizon Fios to come to my town and have faster reliable service, quality customer service agents, skilled technicians, and ethical managers. It's really disappointing that a company as big as Comcast has to still stoop so low in morals and ethics to gain a buck like a cheap prostitute.", "I was scammed by Comcast sale representative \"Christ **\" when called to transfer my business service back to my home. My package included phone line and internet. However, I requested to transfer only the internet and he informed that the whole package has to be moved as a service then I can call to cancel the phone line when the technician completed the installation. Then I was shocked when another representative told me that I signed for a whole new 36 months contract (I was not informed during the recorded conversation) and cannot cancel my phone line for another 6 months; otherwise, I will be charged early termination fee. \r\n\r\nI called Comcast back many times hoping to just cancel my phone line; however, all of them refuse to help and all said \"contact the sale person\", who I have no contact info beside his email, which I emailed and no reply (of course). I've been using with Comcast many years for both my business and home services. They just lost a loyal customer by setting up scam like this...", "If there was less than a 1 for ratings I would use it! As I have pursued other online complaints I notice that I am not the only one with this problem! And my wife, my son, his fianc\u00e9 and my pc's freeze up when trying to access and surf Comcast - Xfinity online service and even accessing my email is a real joke! This is just more proof that corporates only see dollar signs and the consumer doesn't matter! And Television (TV) is no better and when you report that the picture \"stutters\" a techie may show up but to only make an appearance and not change the \"inline filter\" on top of the telephone pole!", "Have used Comcast/XFINITY for 4 years. They wish to charge for upgrades that are not possible in my home. The internet speed is slow. Ask why I had to pay more. They said \"Your building is not updated for upgraded services\". Sorry, that is their responsibility, not mine. Very unhappy with the customer service and supervisors. All they wish is more money for outdated wiring. I disconnected the service because they have no clue of customer service I have worked on cruise ships, NBA sporting venues, NFL venues. Taken care of thousands of customers.", "I signed a new contract in November of 2016 for two years. The contract stated that I owned my own equipment and that I would receive a $30 discount per month for the first year. I happily signed and thought everything was fine. I was apparently wrong. It only was the beginning of my issues with Comcast for the next 5 months of being lied to. I was told month after month that I had to lease equipment from them or my contract would be voided. I never received a single discount from them on this contract.\r\n\r\nThey said due to me not buying or leasing new equipment the contract did end up getting voided out about a month later, so they had me sign another contract. I signed this contract and I was told that this would fix all of the billing issues, only to find out I'm in the exact same spot as before. The contract has been pending for well over a month. I have not received any discounts again. I have overpaid $150 so far on my billing just due to the contracts not being honored. I would not recommend this company to anyone. You are better off using your phone's internet than dealing with this people.", "It has been over a decade since installation but I do remember it being super easy and pain free. It was a pleasant experience. I've always had great customer service and they are fast getting people out when I need it and do great troubleshooting over the phone to help me fix the problems. I rarely if ever get bad service or it going out. Comcast is great and that's why I haven't ever changed providers although I have looked because price is a bit high.", "The internet has very good download speeds and it's the fastest I have ever had. We stream Netflix on multiple devices at the same time without any problems. It has never not worked and always dependable. I've never had to reset the modem and it is always fast. The installation was quick, easy and painless. We had a technician set it up, he was in and out in fifteen minutes. In addition, I had to contact customer service one time and the wait time was relatively short compared to similar companies. I was highly satisfied and the problem was fixed.", "Comcast always corrects problems when they arise and always provides courteous customer service. Normally always arrive at the designated times. Installers were prompt and professional. Professionally attired and knowledge of all questions given to them. They even gave me information to prevent any future interruptions of my cable. Every time I called them they were so very cordial and patient with me no matter how many questions I had. If they could not assist me right then and there on the phone they quickly gave me an appointment to get the problem corrected. I am very happy with the speed of my Internet service and my downloads are much quicker when I get on my iPad. I also have no problems when I use my iPhone and when I use the Wi-Fi connection. I am very happy with it.", "The internet speed is fast and for the most part reliable. I can access websites quickly and multiple ones at a time. Several devices can be connected at once and it doesn't seem to affect the internet speed. However there are many times the internet freezes or goes offline when I am in the middle of doing something. Comcast's customer service sucks to make it worse. There are too many automated options and if I can get through to a rep, the hold times are often ridiculous no matter what time of day or night. They \"accidentally\" disconnect calls often and don't seem to care. The installation was not a problem, though. A rep was sent to my home for set up because there was an issue with me trying to set it up myself. I was told the issue was with my building and the charge was waived after much complaining.", "I didn't use the provided installation, it was much easier to do it ourselves. We just had to pick up the DVR and the process was easy. But customer service takes forever to contact. Horrible. Overcharged for significant period of time, charged us to rent a modem that WE OWNED and double charged for HBO. Generally reliable service and good enough speed. Not as fast as advertised but better than other options in the area. Love being able to watch TV everywhere.", "Ordering on the phone was a simple process, and they didn't try to sell me something I didn't want.  The technician showed up on time as scheduled. He was very friendly, professional, had to do more work than expected but didn't complain at all. Also, he explained how to use everything before he left. Always reliable and fast. The WiFi signal was always strong anywhere in the house. I could always stream videos without any buffering delays and multitask without any slowdowns.", "Comcast provide the channels we are interested in having. Speed is successful and enjoyable. We are happy with our package. However, the package is too expensive and I'm having to take a second look at the package we have. Will look into different providers after the holidays. But the serviceman was prompt, also very knowledgeable and was able to answer all of our questions. Installation was done in a reasonable time period also. Customer service rep was very courteous, polite and knew what they were doing.", "I'm very happy with my speed overall. It's very fast and I never have any connection issues. I love the fact it comes with their hotspot where you can connect to any XFINITY internet connection. My household has several devices hooked up to my wifi but there is very little lag. Installation was very easy and fast and the technician was very knowledgeable. I did speak to a representative once and he did help me with some speed issues I was having. The customer service is ok but I much prefer the chat function over a phone call. I've had to wait 20 minutes before to actually speak with someone.", "Installation experience was easy and quick. They came on time and were helpful in regards to other services like how to use a smart tv. I was very pleased with the reliability in city areas which is what I would recommend. On the other hand, it's a bit more difficult to have good service in smaller towns. Great customer service and I never had a bad experience when it came to getting good service from scheduling a time to install and from the people who installed the internet service.", "The network service was reliable most of the time. Sometimes, the network would have issues connecting and it was just a headache to deal with. The installation process was quick and easy. After my family got Comcast as the Internet service provider, we called them and simply told them the relevant information they needed for it to connect. The customer service at Comcast is great. The associates there are very helpful and will make sure they do what they need to to make sure the customers have the best experience possible. The speed was satisfactory. When we used Comcast as our internet service provider, we had a dial up connection. The dial up connection would be slow at times but it was satisfactory for dial up.", "It did not take them more than a half of an hour to do the installation. They were fast, accurate, and professional, so it was a good experience. The internet connects easily and seems to help me go from website to website quickly, even or my tablet or smartphone so I very rarely have to wait. Although Comcast is an adequate company, but they need to improve their customer service. The hold time is too long when you call into the call center, and the operators are hard to understand, often do not know what they are talking about, and have no knowledge of the product.", "The installation was very easy and fast. The installation tech came to my house and was done in under 30 minutes. They are timely and definitely know what they are doing. The company is very reliable and rarely lets you down. Service is almost always on and they are a company you can definitely count on. They are great. They offer great speed and reliability. You can complete multiple tasks at the same time such as internet browsing or streaming Netflix or watching videos on YouTube. Their customer service reps are also always willing to help you resolve a problem if something comes up. They are there for you when you need help and are great at helping you.", "My internet is extremely slow and very unreliable. WiFi signal drops away often and digital content is slow to load! I cannot even get a steady signal upstairs in my house. If two or more people are online at the same time, forget it!!! It is extremely frustrating! Installed a while ago, and my modem was placed where I have difficulty getting a signal upstairs in my bedroom. Not sure why the installation was done in a less than optimal location for my home. Calling Comcast is a nightmare. If you get to speak to anybody, they often do not know what they are doing. I had a customer service representative lie to me about what my monthly bill amount would be.", "The technician during the installation was nice and knowledgeable. I had no issues and I would recommend. He was very professional and a good person. He was on time and was quick to get the job done. When I call or ask questions they were answered in a good manner. Their customer service looked for possible solutions, not always fixable but was friendly and did what they could. The reliability is usually pretty good though it goes in and out sometimes. It works better upstairs than downstairs, sometimes it will stop working and I will need to reset it. Internet speed is good, other than if there are more than one device it may slow down. No other issues unless I am in the basement.", "The installer was wonderful and very helpful. Took his time and explained everything to all of us. He was also very pleasant and efficient. Comcast has excellent customer service as well. They are always eager to answer any and all questions and resolve any issue we may have. Though we rarely have any issues. The speed is sometimes slower than I'd like. But for the most part I am happy with the service, and I have no complaints. It's usually very reliable and always have great signal. I'm very satisfied and I'd recommend Comcast to anyone.", "The installer was so quick and clean. He also talked to us a lot and made us feel comfortable. He knew exactly what he was doing and we didn't have any help. The customer service with Comcast is great. We never have to ask for anything and when we call they always make sure we are taken care of fast and efficient. The speed is just amazing especially for the price. Comcast is reliable, though sometimes the ping is a little high but we just call and it gets taken care of. I lag sometimes too so it can be annoying. On the other hand it is always quick when loading pages and streaming.", "Comcast installation was fast and the representative was kind and caring. Also they answered all the questions my family had during installation. Comcast is reliable and has amazing fast service. The speed of their internet is top of the line, we have at least 5 devices connected eighty five percent of the time and it doesn't lag at all. Their customer service is on point and reliable. They're on time and courteous. They are polite and friendly as well as communicate well about questions or concerns. They're very customer oriented and caring. They're flexible and helpful at all times and are always on time when they have to come for service calls.", "My speed is excellent for the money I pay for it. Fantastic speeds and WiFi is great too. No tangled wires either. With my job that requires me to have Internet connection at all times this is by far one of the best I've ever had. It hasn't gone out on me since I've had it. Installation was a breezy and friendly service was met to my expectations. The people who came here were respectful and knew exactly what they were doing. I'd rank them at number one and they thoroughly deserve the credit they earned for their excellent service. No one normally does a good job when installing my internet.", "First of all I only have one TV with a cable box hooked (standard box), telephone, internet and security system. OK so I called them a month ago regarding my payment, I did not authorize a transaction. I spoke with a smart customer service representative that argued with me, stating that I did authorize the payment. I told her that I did not, she continued to argue with me, so I said, \"Can I speak to your supervisor?\" She acted like she put me on hold. But on all actuality she hung up on me. Another complaint I have is my bill is too high, so my service is cut off and I have to pay $438.00 in order to restore my service. This is ridiculous, plus there are often times my internet connection is bad or go out. I should charge them for poor service and bad customer service. Worst cable company EVER.", "I returned to my vacation home where for many years I have had the least expensive Internet service (Economy Plus). Because the service is so slow, I called and asked if I could upgrade my internet speed to the next level then downgrade it when I planned to leave in 3 weeks. I was told that was \"no problem\" and that the Internet speed could be increased immediately. The cost would be about $30 more per month so I agreed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Internet speed did NOT increase within an hour, I called again and asked that my order be cancelled and I be returned to my existing plan. I was told that was impossible because my plan was no longer available. I called the following day and asked the same question and was told that they would gladly put me back on my Internet Plus plan immediately.\r\n\r\nMy bill showed that never happened. I have called many times to correct this situation and get my billing back to what it had been before this happened. I have been told that it would be done and, of course, it hadn't. One \"Account Executive\" promised I would receive an email confirming that the correction had been made which never happened. I decided to wait until I could discuss the matter in person at the local Comcast store but called to ask that my Internet account be put on seasonal disconnect until I expected to return in 3 months. That never happened either.\r\n\r\nAfter the call, the customer is asked to rate the performance of THE LAST Account Executive that they spoke with. In every case, the representative assured me that problem was corrected and I rated accordingly BUT in EVERY CASE nothing had been done to correct the situation with my account. I get the impression that these call center employees are just there to humor people and make them feel good by feeding them false information and promises. The only way a company like that can survive is by having a unregulated monopoly.", "I hate the piece of crap DVR they give you. It duplicates shows you've already recorded, loses the place of the show being watched, there's a horrible delay when FF, Rewind, playing shows and you spend more time trying to guess at where to stop the FF than you would have if you'd watched the commercials. When TIVO first came out, we had no problems and that was brand new technology. These jokers at Comcast can't get this DVR service right to save their lives. Sometimes it won't delete shows I don't want to save anymore and I have to restart the system. Total pain in the ass!!!", "The Comcast packages are sold as options but never with all the hidden costs. If you cancel they prorate the service and you cannot get refunds. I had been told lies about internet availability only at 25 MBS (no longer supported the 2 or 10 MBS). That is a total lie. The TV package sold to me included the 75 MBS at the same monthly rate as the 25 MBS. Then that was 20.00 per month more! I didn't activate my TV service but was charged at total of 150.00 for the month of March to April, where I was paying 48.00 per month before. I have not been able to get Comcast to refund the difference. I keep getting passed around and it has been over an hour. This is the second time I have had to speak with them about this. I am going to cancel this service.", "I love giving good/bad reviews for businesses when they are deserved. I truly believe reviews help companies grow and stay in line. Today, Comcast deserves a negative review. I guess that's why Comcast didn't call me for a survey afterwards. They only want that survey if it's good. I digress... I set up my account with Comcast over a year ago. All I wanted was internet and they added basic cable for $20/month. My bill was 71.00/ month. My bill randomly increased to $107 for one month and then dropped back down to $71. So I call to find out why. I spent 30minutes on the phone with a lady that couldn't figure out what happened to my plan. She kept referring to someone that I've never heard who was linked to address (somehow) and then she said my bill was $107 because I had a Triple Play plan (Which I've never had).\r\n\r\nShe couldn't find a rate to match what I had, even though it should not have changed. So I asked her to just cancel my cable and leave me with internet that she quoted at $49/month. She said \"OK I'll get with this other department, we will cancel your cable and leave you with internet at $49/month.\" After being on hold for a few minutes, another lady picks up and says she will be helping me going forward. Totally different personality and she had no clue about what I discussed with the customer service person. \r\n\r\nShe said my only option was $89/month for just internet and said that my bill was just on a promotion plan and that's why it went up to $107/month. So I asked why would it have gone back down to $71 a month later? She said that was what her computer said and that I was on a promotional Triple Play plan. I was given the run around until they could clean up what ever they did to my account. My only option was internet for $89/month so I canceled my account. Reviews are the only way we can prevent companies like this from taking advantage of people. Bait and Switch.", "I have submitted a ticket since February after finding out that I had a contract that I was unaware of. No one got back to me on the matter and Comcast wants to force me to pay the fee whether or not they prove the alleged contract. Once you get involved with Comcast, it doesn't seem that you have control of what they want to charge you. They don't feel obligated to prove why I must pay what they say... and there is no Corporate Office to complain to.", "I was happy with my Xfinity internet with $55/month plan (final bill $55). Then out of clouds, I got a call from customer care saying, if I upgrade my services, to $69.99/month I can get cable as well. Also she mentioned that if not satisfied with Cable, I can disconnect any time. Well, this made me feel good. I upgraded. Hhmmm problems invited. :-( Then I got the device for TV in 2 days, and that's not working and called customer care. They came over and fixed the issue and before fixing he clearly stated its no cost for me. So that we allowed him to do, other wise I could have not ended like this.\r\n\r\nMy first bill after upgrade shooted to $175... Yah no typo. $55 to $175, I would love if it is my stock market price... I called them why charged $60 for the support who fixed the TV service which delivered by Comcast. I wonder I should get credit some bucks. But instead I have to pay them. It took almost 45 mins two-time conversation with Customer care over phone and chat to wipe off that $60. Now my final bill is $92... Where I am landed I was told I am upgrading from $55 to $69.99 but with all hidden things which never told was added now.

So I want to change my services since I don't use TV and Voice, they were trying to charge me more than I am paying now just for internet. I wanted a lower speed and it somehow added up to the same amount I am paying now. RIP-OFF. \r\n\r\nI am disappointed. I am not allowed to change my services online as I want, they want to control you. The devil comes to steal kill and destroy and Comcast is part devil.

I called the customer service number on May 10, 2017 to ask about this error and was apologized to and told it would be 3-4 weeks for a refund. When I stated that was too long to wait and asked to speak to a supervisor I was then told by the agent that he could have my refund to me in 2-3 days due to it being their fault the amount was drafted in error.

To which I was told that it normally takes 2-3 weeks to process the refund (not even the same amount of time). When I explained about my previous call I was told there was no record of that and there is no way to do that. They could put in a \"ticket\" to have my money returned to me electronically but that would take 2-3 weeks or I could wait 2-3 weeks for a check. Upon me voicing my disappointment in those I was told that he would look into the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes back to the phone he gives me the same two choices.

I was trying to get more info about that offer, as if I would be a new customer and I went to the store and checked online, and they said that in my area they do not have that service.

Truth is it\u2019s not that hard to check the internet connection (bps) on my computer and see that they are not giving me what I\u2019m paying for. I think it\u2019s time for residents in Pa. to complain like I am and then rally together with complaints and printouts from our computers showing the low connection (bps) and send it to the state representative or sue comcast like new york did!!!

There are other providers (Dish) for TV, but if you drop the cable from Comcast, they jack the cable internet up to a shocking level. So the $$ you save with Dish is consumed by the price increase for jacked-up price for the (same) internet from Comcast. It's their way of commanding a ransom. Every 6 to 12 months we play the same game... price jacks up and I spend over an hour on the phone with different people until some compromise is found.

I try to get out of my contract because they do not provide service in the area. Comcast then kept me on hold for more than 15 min and still was not helpful. Every time I call I feel like all they do screw me. This is a horrible company and this company should be under investigation for bullying it customers and putting them in unfair situations. They really take advantage of me and my situation. I feel this company is bad in all it does. The service sucks, the customer service sucks, and they suck. If you're moving or even remotely thinking of moving, don't sign up with them for any services.", "Cast in general has very poor customer service and certainly their Xfinity department as well. All of Comcast products are subpar and not innovative or inexpensive. Their customer service is always rude in any hurry and never concise or accurate. For the number one leading company for cable and internet this company is such a shame for customer satisfaction. They outsource their business to other companies in other countries that answer customer service phone calls who do not speak English well and do not enunciate at all which is very frustrating for the consumer. Your bill also cannot be pushed back without service interruption and their bill pay is very slow.", "Moved to this city and got a package \"deal\" (basic internet and TV) for $80+ per month. TV service is supposed to come with a premium channel and On Demand. I have never had access to either. When I call, \"George\" in India reads his script, but cannot resolve the problem or tell me HOW to access these services that he insists I have. Watch out: If you allegedly have a premium channel, you suddenly start getting charged for it after your newbie window ends. I am fairly intelligent (four university degrees), and tech savvy, so the fact that they keep insisting I have something that I don't - yet can't tell me how to access it - is very frustrating. I am patient, kind, and positive towards them, yet they're accusatory towards me, and imply that I messed things up, or that I am incompetent.\r\n\r\nI asked them to end the TV service as I rarely watch. They told me it would be almost $100 per month for BASIC internet ($25 more per month than my current bill for getting less service), and told me it was because I was benefiting from a \"package deal.\" Nice to hold customers hostage this way. Two years ago I lived in another city and got great internet service for $45 per month, but when I moved here I found that Xfinity has a near monopoly on internet/TV services. The only other internet service here is CenturyLink, which has terrible reviews. Xfinity really screws their customers due to having basically no competition.\r\n\r\nWhen I have access to my internet (most of the time), it is speedy. I don't game or stream things, however, only browse the internet, so can't speak to speed in those regards. However, last month, and the month before I lost connection, ran through the recovery drills myself, but ended up having to call them. Their call center guy kept saying I WAS connected, and asked what I \"did to upset your internet.\" Uh, nothing... It was working fine then I was suddenly disconnected. He finally figured out the problem was on their end, after consulting with a co-worker. I had to call again the next month, they went through the same spiel, and I told them I'd called them three weeks ago for the same problem and it WAS on their end. \"George\" from India was surprised, had no record of me calling, but did suddenly \"find\" the problem and I got reconnected after about 1/2 an hour.\r\n\r\nComcast has hidden fees: $20 for \"misc\" fees (they can't tell me what these fees are for), $5 for \"broadcast fees, etc., etc. Although internet works well when you have it, it's a poor value, there is a lack of affordable or flexible options, and the call center folks have to read from a script and it really throws them if you ask questions they can't find answers to in their manifesto. Makes me feel bad for having to call the poor people.", "I am currently finishing my undergrad as an online student.

After 4 hours the first day sending me from one country to another, they didn't fix anything, the 2 day was similar the 3 day. Finally I spoke to a lady in USA call Ashley. She was nice... I suppose I was frustrated and tire I am disable and everything hurt, so I agree to pay $66.48 and after that 28.00 only for the internet. They told me the tlf is expensive because the taxes so I eliminate the tlf, to be taking the 1 of the month is when the month start they charge ahead of time, well they disconnected the telf a week before and I was charge and now I receive a bill of $44.67.

By now I was a little upset since it was the second time.

When I told the representative what has been going on, he did not believe me and thought I was stealing some of the boxes. After getting firm with the representative, he said \"OK\" and gave me the correct boxes I was requesting.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 month of having the service, the Guide, On Demand, Internet and Netflix app would take forever to load. I called and they said there was interference and they would send a tech. When the tech came, he said he couldn't fix it and would have to schedule a different tech to resolve the issue. When the other tech came (2 weeks since the problem started) he wasn't able to resolve the issue and added some connectors which will strengthen the connection. Since then, we sometimes have good service, sometimes we don't. The internet never gives you the speed that you are paying for. This is very disappointing as once, long long time ago, the service was good.\r\n\r\nA month after this happened, I received a bill with extra charges. I called them (again) and asked why I had those charges and they told me it was in error and that they would credit me the amount for next month.

Luckily this time I didn't get billed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nIt's been almost 6 months since I've had the service and last month, I updated my preferred billing method to my new bank account which for some reason never reflected in their internal system so the auto-payment was attempted to be debited from an old bank account which has been closed, yet the website says it was paid successfully. I received a letter in the mail from my previous bank, stating that the payment from Comcast Xfinity was tried to process but it was returned since the account is closed.\r\n\r\nI called once again and now they can't figure it out.

So in August 2017, after the three-year agreement expired I moved to Verizon Fios on September 29, 2017 for a higher internet speed which is 500 mbps. Additionally, I experienced the following problems when I requested Comcast close my account: \r\n\r\n1. Comcast required an additional 60-day extra service fee even after the account was closed. However, there are no terms or conditions regarding an additional 60-day fee on the Service Agreement. 2. I was asked to electronically sign to cancel my account with DocuSign. It required my signature in the middle of the document. So I clicked \"Ok\", and then soon after I figured out that 60-day extra payment was required at the bottom of the document that I did not recognize. Then about an hour later I contacted customer service stating that it was not my intention to agree to those terms of the contract and would like to withdraw my signature. I was denied even after four conversations with the Billing Department Supervisor whose is Johnny. His employee ID **. I asked his last name, but he was evasive and refused to give it. \r\n\r\n3. I asked the customer service agent wherein the Terms and Conditions the additional 60-day charge is noted, and requested that I be e-mailed a photocopy of the agreement.

I then was instructed to swap devices which I did so off to swap out my equipment at the local Xfinity location in Little Rock, AR. \r\n\r\nPrior to that I decided that maybe I will get cable so the kids could have a little more options and had set it up with sales over the phone and all was well. I get to the location immediately. I am asked for my social security which I think is pretty commonplace nowadays and so I ramble it off there. I am thinking he was verifying account info and all this to pick up equipment to set up cable on my existing account. He proceeds to say I need to provide $100.00 deposit and I was baffled being I was not told that on the phone. Either way apparently when you pick up vs. having it send via mail they run your credit and he told me after the fact.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised because there is more. Ok we establish this and then I said cancel the additional service, I asked for a new modem and wanted out. He then explained that is their policy whenever upgrading meaning adding service to existing service. I grab my new modem after the kid tries to make a sale and this is funny as farts the service upgrade would have brought my bill up to $59.99 and guess what the upgrade to my internet would have brought me up to $59.99. I had an issue with that, I said screw it and went on ahead but I was irritated and needed answers so I called sales and asked what was up with this deposit why was I not told and asked to cancel. The lady was nice and convinced to go on ahead that there was no needed deposit and I calm down and decide to keep service. \r\n\r\nI then set up the new internet and chit chat about nothing with the tech guy which he throws in the fact that some of Comcast servers were compromised. Immediately I set up the new device and added 3 devices total and my portal shares all my info and the settings default was the lowest so I set it up the way I need to and see the 3 devices yet I get on my anti virus and pop goes the weasel there an unknown device is on my private network. I called and was transferred to internet support then security and then security says it's fraud and then fraud says that it's not his department. \r\n\r\nFinally I asked for the cancellation department and I ask the young lady that even if Comcast Xfinity or Poopcast Poopfinity was the last company to provide service I would go without being connected. The constant misinformation and no one willing to really assist the miscommunication between phone sales and store front sales regarding policies is evident. \r\n\r\nCorporate America, in this case it's Comcast, thank you for the poop. The fact is all your poor agents are worried about is getting good reviews and the customer service are not trained in a way that they can think for themselves. They stick to a script making them sound robotic reading a poorly written script. The first option when a person calls should be to speak to a human. \r\n\r\nThe truth is losing my little contribution to their pockets is menial however I will never tell anyone to use their service and I know I won't be using it anymore just because of their disorganization. Even going into the store I was repeated the same line over and over like I was an imbecile because instead of expressing that yes there is a disconnect of information between the stores and sales on the phone he kept repeating himself like he memorized the poorly written script provided so that tells me that the supervisors have no flexibility either that or he did not give a rat's behind.", "I am a senior citizen who was not given a service appointment for installation until 3 weeks after I moved here. That meant no internet and no TV for an unbearable time period. When the installer came yesterday, he could not do half the work because I did not have all that was needed. I still have NO internet and only one TV WITHOUT HD service unless I pay more. To top things off, the installation cable is laying on top of my lawn until someone comes to bury it in \"maybe\" a week. I live in a 55+ community where someone could trip over cable and lawn service will be expected to work around it. This is a terrible situation which I am spending a lot of money to be in. Free enterprise or monopoly at work?!?", "I was a Comcast customer for years with no problem and returned to them December 2016 thinking service would be the same. I've had 4 bills and amount has gone up $6/mo., download speed is around 30-40, at best, not 75 \"BLAST\" they supposedly provide and I lost a channel I enjoyed, CMT, because they decided to move it to the sports package. CMT has nothing to do with sports. They want to charge additional 4.99/month for sports package so customers can have CMT channel. I entered into a two year agreement, that Comcast is not adhering to. I received credit for additional fees last month because I refused to pay. If I have to haggle with them again this month (and I will), I'm cancelling agreement, and will NOT pay early termination. Comcast is doing early termination by not honoring an agreement in good faith. I've kept my end of the bargain, they have not.", "Comcast will tell you that your bill is going to be X only to find out the following month it's double that. I have been paying the same rate for 2 years and one day my bill doubled. I called in last month, got it \"corrected\" and this next month I get a bill for $50 higher than the last one which was double what I had been paying for years!!! Comcast is the worst company on planet Earth without exception, I have never seen this level of ineptitude in business.", "I decided to get service with Comcast. I was offered basic cable with HBO and high speed internet as a package for 54.99. I also would receive a 100 gift card. Well, my first real bill was 132.64. My packaged deal more than doubled after all fees. I have called to talk to them and have been disconnected each time. To top it off I never received my gift card. The worst customer service! There should be a law about all the hidden fees. Do not get service with them! Go elsewhere.", "I started experiencing data overages on my account (more than 2 TB), I called Comcast tech support a dozen times. Days later a technician changed out my Comcast modem and my data used dropped to nearly nothing. It's been a nightmare trying to determine the problem. Of course they thought it was malware or something I was doing -- it was not. It was their equipment. I wonder how many people have had the same problem and paid the overage fees?", "Xfinity Comcast has the WORST customer service ever! Unprofessional technicians, who couldn't care less about issues needed to be corrected, pathetic customer service skills, and a wanton disregard for urgency when it comes to wanting to make right what was done wrong! I have been an XFINITY customer for years and I refuse to even pay a single cent to a company who refuses to come replace a cut cable/internet chord outside when an appointment was scheduled! This is unacceptable! I run my business from home and I cannot do that without internet service. No attempts have been made on Xfinity/Comcast's part, to repair the cut line. I have been without internet for a week now. Which means every day I go without internet, I lose money. All Xfinity customer service seems to care about is doing what is convenient for themselves and not what is right for the customers! This is incontrovertibly UNACCEPTABLE!!!", "If you move to an area that Comcast doesn't even service, they still charge you a RIDICULOUS amount of money to cancel your service. Also, every time you are forced to move you are charged a \"New Customer\" set up fee and they \"RESTART\" your contract. We were customers for over 10 YEARS and are being charged an early termination fee. We WILL NOT be back. Also, every time it storms, our service would go out for sometimes DAYS. I operate a business with this service and many days I was unable to work. Comcast only responded with \"Sorry for this inconvenience\". Over, and over, and over. Anyone who has to move regularly for work, or otherwise, should definitely use another service! I will not use them again. When we are moved the next time, Comcast will NOT get my business. Ridiculous! Over $200/month times 10 years is a LOT of money. They won't get any more.", "Be forewarned. Even though Comcast advertises $20 per month internet, you may not get it, and when you cancel, they may not cancel you. Called for better deals 4/14. Had none, so moved to WOW. Installed 4/17, and called Comcast to cancel. Returned box 4/20, got confirmation email 4/21 they had it. No problem. Got billed again 4/23. Just called to ask about the bill, and they didn't bother cancelling me on 4/17, it took them 10 days to process it, and guess what, I got to pay for all of them. Terrible service. All they want is your money. Stay away if you can.", "I was on hold for 30 minutes and was disconnected by the computer. Then I called again and tried to do a live chat. An hour later the live chat still hasn't connected. I got someone on the phone finally and when I asked to speak to a supervisor he asked me a million questions (mostly the same info over and over) and I am still on hold now, an hour and a half later. I cancelled my account but I keep getting bills saying they are overdue and a collection agency will be notified. All for a service I had for only one week. Thankfully I'm back with Verizon now. Whatever you do, don't get Comcast!!!", "We were given notice that we would start getting billed for a modem. My husband called to let them know we use our own modem and not theirs. They assured us we would not be billed but we were and we have been going around with them for the last 8 months and have spent hours on the phone, computer and even in the local office trying to get this resolved only to be told it was either taken care of or they can not help me. Even told them to cancel our bill this last time only to be told that only the billing department can do that and I was not allowed to talk to the billing department until I paid the fees they charged that I do not owe. How absurd!", "I recently decided to try Comcast Internet Service, they have a 30 day guarantee so I couldn't lose right? Within hours of installing their service I entered a wifi nightmare. I spent hours and hours on the phone with customer support, made a trip to our local store which is 30 minutes away and even when it was working it was slower than the Frontier service I had previously used. Eventually I gave up and cancelled after 27 days - 3 days within their 30 day guarantee. Now, it's 3 months later and I'm being hounded for the $90.10 they claim I owe them.\r\n\r\nI have now spoken to 4 different customer service reps who all look at my account and assure me they will take care of the problem. No one has succeeded yet and now I've received a notice from a collection agency. A COLLECTION AGENCY!!! I've filed a dispute with them, but I'm now convinced that Comcast will continue to hound me and screw up my credit as well. Worst decision I ever made was deciding to try Comcast.", "Xfinity's super safe and fast internet died in an exam on me today after 3 hours of work. Customer support was so unbelievable stupid that I had to explain to him what to do. Their guy did not understand the difference between Mac and Windows and tried to tell me that I should use the  \"other \" one whatever he meant with it. After 1 hour the internet came back up. I don't understand how a tech support be that uninformed, unintelligent in his apparently chosen field of work. Great job picking employees.", "We were 100% lied to about the abilities of the X1 box. We were told by the technician when we changed our box that you will not lose any recordings. So I called and was told my signal was weak, because when I deleted a recording I got the loading buttons. So he came and installed a boost box! Then in turn says \"call and have another boost box installed.\" So Monday another technician comes and said we could not get another boost box? He changes out a cord and takes my box out. \r\n\r\nSo I asked about my losing recordings he says no again like I have been told from the beginning and heard on the commercials!!! Lies. My box is down to 2% - uh where are all my recordings??? So of course my husband (unplugs the box because we were told to if the recordings did not come back) so he calls back and the agent proceeds to rebooting the box! She did not want to stay on the phone for whatever reason, so she claimed to put in a ticket so she or someone else would call back. Which never happened. \r\n\r\nSo I called and proceeded to tell the agent what my issue is. She begins with \"do you own a iPhone and the X1 box is similar to the cloud on the iPhone.\" WHAT? (Never ever have I heard that reference!)!! ALL MY MOVIES WHICH I SAVED are on a cloud off of an app on a computer!! We were told every last time until today ALL my recordings would come over to the next box. Why would I save them to be accessed off a computer??? \r\n\r\nWhy Comcast? It is false advertisement to pay all that money monthly for a fake box! Waited almost 3 years to get the movies that I love with the belief that I would not be in this position yet again! So Comcast as a whole totally disappointed and saddened by the LIES, LIES, LIES!! And by the way COMCAST is quick TO TURN IT OFF IF WE ARE LATE THOUGH. SO HOW CAN WE BE REIMBURSED FOR ALL THE LIES???", "Here we are again... Comcast has changed the format of their e-mail... and it does not work. I cannot conduct business. This has been acting up for the last 3 weeks. All I get is system errors on the e-mail system. Been out for over 2 hours today. We need AOL to come back. I thought AT&T was bad... This is worse. Don't sign on their dotted line for service.", "As a company owner I found out that an employee set up a new Comcast account opposed to a move/transfer account for our company. She had no authorization to sign a contract and did. When our IT company came to move our server he called and informed me I had two accounts instead of the one we have had for over two years... I spoke with customer service and she forwarded me to retention. I explained the mess up to the horrible guy on the other line and after 2 hours he told me I HAD to have two accounts? I explained it is a small company and I do not need service in both places (we only moved our office 10 feet and still have the same address).\r\n\r\nFinal result he said the only way to get away from the contract is to pay over $3,000 Dollars on the new account. I am so disgusted with such horrible customer service - the only thing they are interested in is paying the sales guy that mislead my employee to believe she needed new service. If you are a business owner stay away from Comcast. They are very sneaky. Cannot believe they will not honor my request after seeing we did not need a new account! The employee in retention was very hateful and aggressive. Horrible business practice.", "This company doesn't care about customers, their prices increase without notice, offers to get your business then they Rob you blindly. Government gives a ten dollar internet but they request you haven't been their customer for 3 month, if your job situation change how will you be 3 months without internet just because they say so? Where is the sense on that? If your community provides basic cable the company still charges you the full price as you have internet + basic cable charging twice for the service.", "Ok really don't know where to start 'cause there is so many different things happening here. Had Comcast installed a few days ago. Well ever since Friday 6/09/2017 my phone has not work... My mother has lifeline and if there is an emergency she would not dial in. The phone number is a native number but it will not allow anyone to return a call. Have spent a total of 24 hours on the phone since Friday with customer service... The overseas people don't understand how important this is and the sales girl got the wrong number to my account. I have asked to talk to the USA customer service and they refuse to get me anyone. At this point if Comcast can't fix all issues today they may get their ** back. My time is way valuable to be worried and constantly on the phone with dumb people. I need the highest person from Comcast to call me... ASAP. Comcast triple play.", "Beware! Comcast has the inability to listen to customers -- especially when the customer ask for the service to be disconnected! I asked for this mediocre Comcast cable service to be disconnected and it took them three months--count them: THREE MONTHS to do so.

I am so tired of the bi-monthly bill battle. I signed up for 19.99. Had that rate for a few months, then it went to 29.99 and then 49.99 and then 74.99. I call, I complained, I got nowhere. I filed a complaint with the FCC and finally Comcast/Xfinity moves to drop rate to 29.99. Exhausted, I agreed to the 29.99 and 5 months later I get a new bill for 49.99. \r\n\r\nI call and ask why? They say, \"your promotion ended.\" Sigh, I have to waste another hour on the phone and they run the same routine. \"No, this time you will really get the 29.99 and we will credit 20.00 and your real new annual contract starts now.\" Sigh. \"Can I pay my bill now?\" \"Please hold.\" Why do I have to fight with them every single month? And what is with their 19 day billing month? How do they get away with that? Maybe someday they will be like Sprint, begging for business, but with a market so burnt they cannot give it away. Just call and press cancel, it is the only way to get anyone to help you with their crooked billing system.", "I was repeatedly told by Comcast that I was signing up for a no contract, no early termination service. I canceled the service after nine months and was slapped with a 200 dollar early termination fee. Comcast told me there was nothing I could do and I have to pay it.

I have called 8 times total spending an hour or more on service call with no resolution and 1 in home service call where technician just stated, he \"COULDN'T FIX IT\" with no alternative action for me to follow up.

One day, without our consent they removed the offer and we were being charged without any discount, and the monthly rates shot up. This is a big scam company, making people join their internet services, but duping them with fraudulent charges without their consent. I called them to have this issue addressed. But, I was informed that the charges cannot be reverted and to have reduced monthly rates, I will have to cancel some services and internet speed will be reduced from 200 Mbps to 55 Mbps.\r\n\r\nThey make us have their services at discounted rates and all of a sudden charge you with amounts that were never revealed when signing the contract. When mentioned that I can sue the company for fraudulent charges, they said that I can do whatever I like and they don't care about this and that they are aware of this issue which has been reported by many other customers.

I've never had a problem with them and love their service. Thanks guys!!", "I have been a customer for 6-7 years. The last 2-3 years has been an uphill battle every month they bill me. The stress is truly getting to me physically. I am seriously ill when their name comes up. I put one star as I can't put a negative!! About a year ago, I suddenly received a box of equipment, which I returned to the store. I found out they were charging me for the Triple X or whatever the most expensive plan was. I called immediately of course and was told it would be fixed... A year later it's not. The equipment was returned, in the box, the same week. In the meantime, my bill has been so high that I only have internet and about 30 channels, maybe (some Spanish, which I'm not). I had to have them take my HBO, take all my other channels, and now WOW... believe it or not, after all that my bill is HIGHER!!! I have taken everything I can to get the bill lower and it is still higher.\r\n\r\nWORD TO THE WISE: When you call customer service they have what is called \"First Line\". They tell you they will help, they don't. The first line's job is not to let any calls get thru to any other affiliates of Comcast/Xfinity. They actually get fired if they pass on calls!! So first line can send you to manager, same thing... Line 1.5, if you are lucky enough to get to customer retention... Again... they will fix it, but no one ever does... LIES LIES LIES!!! I have been charged, disconnect and reconnect service when that hasn't happened. They also charge a convenience fee of just under $10. Convenience??? WTH, there is nothing convenient about them. They will probably cut my service off this month and I will probably just go to the closest internet grocery store. My roommate can't even stand to be in the room when I call. I have talked to them all... 7-9 people I get in one day... No one does **!\r\n\r\nLike I said, I have dropped so much of my service and now my bill is higher than before... This is a sham. I HATE THESE PEOPLE!!! They do nothing towards customer satisfaction and when I go to the Xfinity store they ask if I can come back another time as they are short on employees. I really wish they would put someone in charge there that has half a brain. I would be ashamed to work for them. So they say Trump is bringing jobs back to the US. Start by telling the customer service from India, Indonesia, Mexico etc... that they will be losing their jobs... If enough of us let them know, maybe we can attack them internally and put them out of business. So, if you drop services to lower your bill, be cautious, as I assure you they will find some far out charge to make up the difference. Whatever happened to FREE TV?

After several phone calls and talking to level 1, 2 and 3 technicians, I was informed that many customers had experienced this because of a Comcast website server update just prior to the day I discovered them missing. At that point the technician told me there was no way to recover them. I was devastated because there were some EXTREMELY important emails that were lost.\r\n\r\nI contacted the office of Tom ** VP of Customer Experience, and explained what happened. I was contacted by a man named Timothy **, who explained that my case had been escalated and passed to him. He stated that he was very sorry and offered me 3 months' worth of free service. I explained that some of the missing emails were evidence in an upcoming child custody case and that until the custody case was resolved I wasn't taking any \"settlement\" from them. If the loss of my emails resulted in a bad outcome their 3 months of service would not be adequate compensation. I told him I would contact him after the case was over. He said he wanted to go ahead and close the case and I could reopen it at a later date, and I said NO, leave it open. I didn't want to have to explain it all over again.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 2016, I contacted Timothy ** to tell him that the loss of emails had effected the court case negatively, and that he needed to rethink his offer to me. At that he wrote to me, \"Honestly, with the trouble you had with the case, it is really hard to place a price on this situation. I can still offer the two months of free service.\" I responded with, \"You previously offered me 3 months of service.\" He did not respond to me after that.\r\n\r\nI once again contacted Tom **'s office and this time the person who contacted me said that the case had been closed and that the notes on the case stated that I had declined any further attempts to try to recover my missing emails, and that the investigation showed that they were not at fault, my computer was. They also stated that I had declined a $300 credit. This \"so-called\" report was false. Complete lies.

The internet is extremely slow even though we pay for the highest speed option and it's only 3 people using it in my house. Then when we call customer service, they don't help at all. They either make up excuses (it's a temporary problem or just restart 20 times a day!). A complete waste of $200 a month! Stay away from Comcast if you can! I wish I could!", "I am having a such a bad experience with Comcast and it is kind of impossible to get the right info from customer service. I've been calling for one week and spoke to 5 different agent and I got 5 different answers from each individual. I was not expecting to cancel my service but I also did not expect to be misdirected.\r\nBefore I had decided to get a service from Comcast, I called the customer service to make sure that I won't be charged more than $39.99 which I used to pay before with 75 mbps and they confirmed that I will not pay more than $39.99 which is included taxes. Once I called the 3rd agent to schedule a time for installation, he told me technicians will be installing the cable and although I told him that I am not using the tv and do not want to charge for tv, I was again told it is included in the package with no charge. \r\n\r\nNow what I am seeing in my first bill is $39.99 + $10.00 (speed increase which I never asked for) + $7.00 (Broadcast tv fee) + 7.53 (tv tax). Before I chose Comcast, wasted my hours to make sure I am not going to charged more than $39.99 and now I am wasting my time to explain the situation I have to every single person over the phone. I also called on Saturday to ask for the speed increase charge and cancel the TV and the lady told me to call the cancellation department on Monday and she said they will cancel the TV. \r\n\r\nOn Monday, I called the cancellation department and I was told that they cannot cancel and he directed me to the other department. I waited 72 hours (which was the time period that they were supposed to contact with me) and called them again. This time, the other agent was telling me a different thing. I was misled from the beginning to be installed the service and wasted another 2 days to stay home.

The other one offers you billed and cartels, they told me, \"You will get 200 Mbps,\" only gets to 65 if you are lucky. The modem is very cheap and do not work properly after two weeks. They gave me a second one that was worst than the first one, also I was told that I was going to pay for my service $65.00 a month. A month later my bill raise to $70.00.

To reach support one simply has the following options: Call: spend years going through an automated system that has no concept of anything other than referring to the website. Chat: a poor person sitting on the other side trying to explain a service that acts like a yo-yo on a good day. The service is totally unreliable. The best use for its highest speed is to be able to check your emails on February 29, every 4 years.\r\n\r\nI called them and asked if I can charge them the same fee they charge me for late payment. It would be fair if they give us credit or a penalty is imposed on them for taking our money and providing no service. Given the net neutrality & its repeal, Comcast is nothing but a pure extortion syndicate where they charge whatever they want, log all your traffic, sell your information, and when they don't want to service you simply drop the connection.

When I started to disconnect from rental to new home, Comcast rep told me I would have service by end of March 2017. End of March came and went. I started calling every service that was available in this area... which was only satellite... not good. I was desperate, so I tried Hughesnet... That was a disaster. Slow even for minimal use.\r\nI called Comcast at end of March and was told 2 more weeks for service... By this time I had moved in with my parents in a city 3 hours away... to be able to work (renting office space would have been very costly).

I was assigned a corporate customer service rep... he was getting info from the useless reps that stopped answering my calls... This issue was supposedly at the \"escalation \" level... Righhht... I was then told 2 more weeks... which came and... went... then was told \"no idea when\" and was explained to me how the \"process of getting new service works and the problems with it.\" Ok. This just pissed me off more.. because... number 1... not my problem! \r\n\r\nMy husband was very proactive at this point as we were closing in on 4 months of living separate and being inconvenienced. He talked to a tech who worked for a company that comcast contracted this particular part of job too... This tech explained what Needed to be done and Why there was a hold up... Not only were we a new subdivision BUT, we were being upgraded to the newest, latest and greatest... only one other city in the state had been upgraded... AND that they had Spare parts!!! The very part that had been ordered for our area and was used for a different area... Due to them having \" more clout\" So, with that information in hand I tell my corporate rep... which he just ignored... \r\n\r\nSo I then email Ceo of comcast after filing complaint with FCC, telling him about my issue and the FCC complaint and the extra part. I received email back from executive office of national customer services... Shortly after that.... Gee... I never saw so many So determined to get the job done. 4 months after I initiated this I had service... and for my inconvenience, stress and money spent... what did comcast Do for me??? Oh... we will waive the installation fee.... Wow!!! I proceeded to tell the corporate rep that was ridiculous!! This is all my trouble was worth!!! That a company of this size couldn't do better! That had the FIRST Comcast rep or even the 2nd, 3rd rep would have Told my What was Really going on and that it would take 4 mos... all my stress and near heart attack moments from said stress Could Have been avoided.... \r\n\r\nCorporate rep says he's going to talk to his supervisor (Right... most likely just taking a drink and pretending to talk to someone) comes back to phone to say that they would waive the installation fee and first month bill. And the asks if this ok... ummm... not much choice as my stress level already through the roof from all this. Comcast says they \"Strive to Excel \" in customer service... HA!!! They Failed on all Levels!!! So if you have other choices for internet... take it!!! ALSO, BEWARE, they plan to UPGRADE every COMCAST customer... if it took 4 mos of lies for me... who knows how long it will take for you!", "I have been having multiple problems with Comcast Cable Xfinity. Every time I turn around my cable is pixelating. I call and ask for a signal as I've been told mine is weak. But recently when I called I got a crazy person who sent a signal that said it was updating my subscription, I explained this was wrong but the lady assured me it was a normal signal but afterward I lost many channels, l called the Comcast hotline number given to me by Comcast corporate for the fact I constantly have issues they were obviously tired of dealing with so they foisted me off on the hotline number to people who try really hard nicely to rectify the problems just usually aren't able.\r\n\r\nSo then they send some tech out who has no idea what's going on. They check and tell you no problem can be found. Which of course is true as the problem originated at their office not my home. So I've contacted the FTC. And the Utility Commission since Comcast can't no should I say won't rectify their issues. I get so very tired of dealing with this daily seems like they would fix it. I've told them I believe they single me out to mess up my cable. The agent assured me the company is too large to do that. Don't think so. One individual person I've gotten angry and told off could be annoying me and I truly believe it's possible. You have no idea how many employees I've dealt with, argued with and stressed my issues to.", "Last month (August), we tried to make a partial payment to Comcast. I didn't have enough money to make a full payment at the time due to having to spend all of my previous money on bills, and for paying for healthcare expenses out of pocket. The people at the Comcast center wouldn't accept our payment, even after we explained everything that went on, and we had no choice but to not pay it off and lose our internet service. (Which to be clear, the bill was $196, and we offered to pay $100 at the time. And keep in mind, we've been consistently making payments and paying them off every month as well.)\r\n\r\nFast forward to a month later, and I finally had enough money to pay them off. Only to discover that, on top of the $152.69 we paid them, we also had to pay an extra $100 in the form of a security deposit, in order to get our internet turned back on. This is a new policy they've implemented, and I was not informed of this until now. And given as I said before, we've been consistently making payments to them prior until they cut us off, it's also unfair they cut us off like that and are forcing us to pay a security deposit in order to get the internet turned back on. The truth is, Comcast doesn't really care about you. They are leeches who suck as much as they can from their customers, and will hold you upside down until they can extract every drop of blood out of you. They are terrible, and I wish we had some actual competition in this area so I wouldn't have to put up with them anymore.", "The only problem I have with \"Comcast\" is their greed. Comcast's prices are getting more and more expensive. They raise the prices at least once a year sometimes two or three times a year.", "They are very expensive. They give wonderful deals to new customers, but, when you've been their customer for over 20 years, I guess that means nothing.", "My best experience was with Comcast before the merger with XFINITY. I had lots of fun working with Comcast and how the phone service worked with the internet. I recall that the price was doable for me. Today they respond quickly when setting up or adding new service, but extremely slow in responding to problems.", "This company has the monopoly of it all, even though the prices are high and the customer service may not be that great especially when you get someone over the phone that does not understand English on what you're saying. When do we as customers get to start picking our own channels that we like and use more than the others that we do not use?", "I went into Richfield Comcast Xfinity on my mother's behalf. She needed her bill lowered. Couldn't afford $148 a month. I was well received and customer service rep I talked to was very helpful. We checked out her account and found a way to get it reduced to $113. He also handed me an upgraded box at no charge. Mom's been with them for a while. I ran back with paperwork showing her new bill, she was happy. A month goes by first bill is $160. Then $158 and $152. That's when she asked me why it's not going down. So I immediately called. I explained everything over the phone. He was saying she was under contract, which I replied \"I have paperwork showing not under contract.\" Then he replies he didn't show that she was but she verbally had confirmed it. He later said he didn't see that either. I told him to cancel her TV internet. He told me he would put it on a hold to have us see if something could be done. \r\n\r\nI ended up calling back for a disconnect, this time I was told how sorry he was and told me he would see what he could do. He pretty much said he could take the telephone off. That save some. I said, \"How much?\" She never wanted or used it anyway. Then he says it will save you 8 dollars so the bill would be $152. I said, \"Look. It suppose to be $113.\" I told him to disconnect. He too put it on a hold. Which brings me to today. I called to get it disconnected again same thing. Tell him to disconnect. He said he was sorry I didn't call him first. He knew he could give my Mother just what she was looking for. I said \"No. Disconnect.\" So I'm on hold. 5 min later he comes back. Says he took care of it but all of a sudden his computer froze. \r\n\r\nSo I would have to go through disconnections, I got this awful person on the line cold as ice. Definitely no blood in her veins. Ignored everything I had told her. No sympathy, understanding or thanks for your loyalty. She's adding a early disconnect fee of $86 dollars. I said, \"I'm taking this to court.\" I am leaving out so much. Like I tried to get a hold of the original guy I talked to. Phone rings 5 times then hangs up. Go ahead try it 800-934-6489. I wish we could a rebel against being taken advantage of. What's with all the commercials limited regular basic channels. I grew up when customers mattered and you appreciated their business. Thanks for letting me vent a little. Don't let them take advantage of your family especially if they are elderly. My Mom's in her 80's.", "I order service then I upgrade to Triple Play a week or so later. When I upgrade they tell me it's a contract and I have 30 days to cancel risk-free. My service stops working one day after the upgrade. I go a week with limited to no internet and having to reset tv everyday. I call, and advise them that based on what the tech said I need a different cable box to fix the tv, so they say they will send me \"One\". Wait a few days and get a big box with \"Three\" cable boxes, one small, one the same as I have and one that's 100 years old. I call tech when the little box they sent don't work and they tell me that box is the standard box. I need the premium one, then they tell me to install the one they sent me, to which I reply \"this is the one.\" After they finally get the situation they offer me 3 choices, wait for another order, go into a store, or a tech. I ask for a tech to which she says \"it will be 90 bucks but I can probably get customer service to refund that\". \r\n\r\nThe tech arrives a few days later, and brings the right box and ask why we have an old box and we inform Comcast sent it. He leaves and that night it messes up again. This was the last straw so checked with customer service who said I had until the 20th of June to cancel and I would be within my 30 days. I call customer service and tell them I want my service to end the 17th, enough time for me to get new service. So I get Verizon to install my service on the 16th of June and call again to confirm they cancel service to which they say \"Yes sir, please return the equipment within 10 days.\" This was Saturday so we return it Monday and get a receipt which shows 6/19/2017 one day before the 30-day agreement.\r\n\r\nA week or so later I see my online account still shows active so I check and sure enough it's still active, while I dont have any equipment or anything. I call and they tell me it's still on, no one canceled it but they would. I then get a bill for June 17 through July 17th and a $230 early cancellation fee notice. So I call again and explain the situation, and the chat person sees where the contract started for Triple play on May 20th given me 30 days to cancel. She states I have to call in to have them cancel the fee, to which I do and they tell me they can't because I canceled on the 26th, 6 days later. So all in all I will have paid over 700 for 15 days of Comcast service, wasted 7 hours on the phone, and 4 hours on the chat system. Worst company in the world.", "Comcast doesn't seem to able to provide customer service anymore. I need to reset my password and I am sent into a live chat where the agents can't seem to locate my account, I have to repeat myself over and over. I don't like to call because I go through a bunch of automated prompts and the people at the store seem like deer in the headlights when you need something. I signed up for a triple play, one box works, one doesn't. My wife called to get help with our second box and nearly ended up in tears because the person on the other side simply read a script and ignored what she said. I have no other options to get the speed Comcast provides in my area and the service has been reliable, the customer service, however, has also been really, really horrible.\r\n\r\nCOMCAST please stop trying to save a dime and hire people that can actually help. Your technology solution, while impressive for those who know, hasn't resulted in the customer relationships you may think, but how would you know that. You are two degrees removed from actually talking to your customers. Just FYI, I don't need help \"rebooting my modem\", I do that long before I call with a problem, I don't need a customer service rep to chat with to change my account password, just need to reset my password.", "I gave a prior bad review and wanted to give a follow-up. I hired a private business (five star!) to come and resolve my Xfinity problems... $400 plus for a 3.5 hour visit, but well worth it in the end. Kind of like a psychiatrist session! I'm \"connected\" in my office - and my business phone is on the desk, not by my bedroom TV which is where Xfinity's \"independent\" installer (who came in business attire - a ratty t-shirt with 5 holes and definitely no Xfinity ID) said was the only place he could put it. My main TV is connected - and it was them who had to deal with the Xfinity phone rep until it actually happened - which still took almost half an hour of \"my\" paid time but I was grateful. (Oh, helpful hint: several days after initial Xfinity service began my only TV was not connecting. I called Xfinity - one hour to no avail. I fixed it myself by connecting to the service on my iPhone which then brought my TV back.)", "About a month ago, we started to have problems with our service (intermittent drops and extremely slow speeds). Changed out an end-of-life (EOL) modem rented from Comcast and got a new gateway that replaced both the Ubee modem and our Cisco e2500 router. Had that for over a week and still had problems with drops and negligible speed. Reset the gateway countless times and the problem was never resolved. Bought a Zoom 5345 modem and installed. Called Comcast to update the root with the Mac address and they said the mac address was already existing. Got a new Zoom 5345 from the manufacturer. That one updated fine. Continued to have problems with drops and slow speeds.\r\n\r\nBought a Tenda AC1200 router and set up. The problems still persist. 2 technicians have been to the home and although we are not sure, \"software upgrades\" was a term that was used. We wonder if the software upgrades are throttling service to force upgrades in service. We have had Magic Jack (since 2008) for years without crackling with our Comcast internet service that is not as long and suddenly every device in our house is getting drops. We've actually had more devices connected to our wifi last year than we do today without any issues and today we have dual band adapters to take advantage of the 5 GHz band. Something is up with Comcast.\r\n\r\nOur third technician visit is scheduled for Monday and we are not holding our breath. Public wifi, overloaded nodes are the issue. It's infrastructure and it's not keeping up, in fact we believe that the public wifi is the major cause of the problem. Who wants to connect to a public wifi when they are at home? This is a major throttling effort. Be warned. Comcast, should be the steadiest service out there. It's worse than satellite and on par with smoke signals.", "I've only lived in my new location since April 2017. So far, Xfinity has been the biggest headache of my relocation. The service is down quite often. The company sends these $5.99 coupons to apologize or they take $1.50 off your bill each time (if you call). But, what you really want is to enjoy your home television viewing experience and be able to count on having Internet service when you turn on your computer. I often work from home and this poor unreliable service has been costly for me. Today, the service has been out all day. It's 9:30 pm now and we can only watch 1 channel. When we call the recorded message on the service line says they expect the service to be operable at 1:15 am. Another lost day! And night. This happens too often. I sometimes wish Amazon would move into the internet/cable business. It seems anything THEY do, it's with excellence including super customer service.", "I sometimes play online games. Comcast has the most unstable internet. I called them many times. Every time I call they run some stuff and the speed and connection is good, after a few hours it goes back to the same terrible internet. I canceled my subscription today. Don't ever get Xfinity for your home.", "Been using Xfinity for 9 months here in Houston, but most of the time your connection gets interrupted for almost 6 times a day. I called them saying they are too having connection issues... Then why not fix it once and for all? Like most companies, they are too fast at collecting your dues, but too slow to respond on your inquiries and complaints.", "After a year of \"area updates\" that shut down my internet, slow connections that often die, and trouble with their automatic online payment system, I decided to cut the umbilical cord. I called their agent and requested an account termination. Oh how innocent I was. I spoke to their agent, asked to terminate, paid my bill over the phone, was told that I was terminated, received an email thanking me for my payment of all outstanding dues... and now face extra months of more payment for services that I never asked. Instead of a termination, I became a \"reactivated account\" as soon as I paid my bill. They never told me that my account was reactivated. They never told me that I couldn't terminate over the phone after paying everything I owed them. They simply lied and now have $100 more of my money.\r\n\r\nI'm angry at the helplessness and uncertainty. Even now after calling a second time, I'm unsure about whether they'll find a second malignant means to leech money out of me for the worst internet experience of my life. I didn't believe in big government before this but now I'm beginning to. Regulate these shady corporations and send them away. In prison, perhaps also tack on secret charges that keep them in for far longer than the judge said.", "Comcast is the worst experience that I ever had with a company. The agents are liars and the supervisor takes up for them. I requested that my account be placed on hold for 3 weeks because I was moving to a new address. The agent didn't explain to me that the minimum time to put my account on hold was for 90 days. They changed me for the 3 weeks my account was on hold without my knowledge. They then send me a bill for $455. They didn't even transfer my account. Instead they created a new account and told me I have to Pay 1 month in advance. I asked the supervisor to play the recordings with the agents and she said that they weren't available anymore. In short Comcast is a scam. They are also thieves and liars. I don't recommend this company.", "Recently moved from Missouri. I have ordered my internet service for installation on the 8th. I wanted to have my service as soon I move in since I work in IT area and my toddler watches cartoons online. Installer did not show up that day. I had to beg for getting service - Call center located overseas. They did not help. Installer came 5 days later. I have ordered internet which cost $39.99 + Tax + Equipment rental $10.00 per month. After receiving my bill, I had to pay over $100.00 for installation charge and OTHER FEES.\r\n\r\nThey don't tell you what other FEES are! 2nd billing cycle, I have noticed they are charging me $49.99 per month. I asked WHY? They said sorry and \"adjusting the bill and we will give you a better package where you will pay $29.99\". Even cheaper! I was happy. Good customer service. Actually it was SCAM and sales technique just like WELLS FARGO did! I don't need and asked for TV service. Never asked for it. I called Xfinity/COMCAST on 07/12/2017. The guy was telling me that I have TV so they are charging now $60 plus others... I said TV streaming supposed to be free service and I never asked for additional service. There is a $7.00 charge for TV. WHY? The guy said it is for local TV provider. They charge Comcast and Comcast charge customers!! SCAM!! I don't need it, I don't watch local TV.\r\n\r\nCOMCAST forcing customer to pay for local TV but WHY? Why do I have to pay? Comcast need to fix this issue. I just need $39.99 Internet service. That's ALL. DOLLAR AMOUNT ADDS UP. Imagine they are doing this to 100s of customer!! Charging extra money and many of us don't even understand the bill.

I had the Blast internet, with download speeds of 75Mbps. I agreed to the new rate, for the SAME service. When I checked my account, I discovered that I had been downgraded to 10 Mbps. I called to have the problem fixed, however they refused to honor the rate I had agreed to. They offered me a higher rate, which I declined. I was told that they would review my previous call, and call me within 48 hours, but I did not receive a call.\r\n\r\nI called back today, and was told that promotion is no longer available and they cannot honor it. It was available when I agreed to it, and someone at their company made a mistake. I am only asking for them to honor the rate that I agreed to. I was told again today that someone will call me back within 48 hours. If they do not call me back and make this right, I will be leaving Comcast after being a customer for 10 years. How can a company stay in business while treating their loyal customers this way?", "I got Xfinity X1 4-5 months ago. Although it has some weak points vs. the old system (like the inability to expand very narrow movies), in general X1 is a HUGE improvement over the old system. BUT... it has one annoying characteristic: It slows your ability to open websites on your computer. Some attempts even result in a perpetually turning circle (my browser is Chrome)/never connects. Other times if you interrupt the turning circle by hitting the stop icon, then immediately hit the reload icon, it connects to the site immediately. Go figure. A tech rep was here yesterday to try to figure out why this was happening. He admitted that X1 involves some kind of filter that keeps the signal to the DVR from interfering with other DVRs in the area, and that filter may also sometimes mistake a request to connect to a site with an unwanted intrusion.\r\n\r\nThe filter is also apparently responsible for some strange email behavior. If I put any email address with an aol.com domain in it in the Bcc: box, it bounces: \"Permanent error\". If I put the address in the To: box, it goes out, no problem. But some days, aol.com addresses in the Bcc: box go out fine; but most days, \"Permanent error\". I thought maybe I should try using Comcast mail, but it has a list of problems that would make this review way too long.", "Don't waste your time or money. Comcast is a scam. I wouldn't wish Comcast's ** services on my worst enemy. If you do have Comcast, then I hope you don't ever plan on moving because apparently for Comcast, transferring your internet or home security to a new address is pretty much asking them to move mountains. And if you ever make an appointment with them, don't get your hopes up because it will take about 4 tries for them to do even the most simple of tasks! So get ready to reschedule your appointments at least 4 times, and when you do call to reschedule (because they sent the wrong guy, or nobody showed up) I hope you have the day off because even a simple task like rescheduling an appointment, to Comcast, is like asking to build a rocket ship. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to be put on hold on average about 4 times for as long as an hour, for them to only tell you that they can't reschedule your appointment, and to call back in 2 days! Oh, and don't expect to get whatever it is you need done to get done for at least a few weeks after you need it done. Overall Comcast is just a huge waste of time and after trying to just get one simple task done with them, I will never be the same mentally. Be smart, save yourself, don't sign up.", "I purchased a new home where Comcast Xfinity is the only provider of Internet services. I've had the service for a month and a half and of that time I've actively had internet for 7 days. Every day begins the same. No services or spotty at best. Forget calling customer service as they only want to send a signal to restart your modem. One day they actually restarted my modem 56 times. My modem and equipment is fine, it's the service that is the problem. I took my equipment to my other home where a different provider supplies services and everything worked great. Comcast sent out a technician who pulled into my driveway and pinged my modem then knocked on my door stating \"Your internet is fixed.\" He didn't check the exterior lines. He told me there was no need to as I currently was showing signal. Wouldn't you know it? The second he left my internet was again out. \r\n\r\nI call and complain daily only to be met with the same tired old story of \"Have you restarted your modem?\" Then followed up with \"Let's do that now.\" Following the script they're provided they then say \"I'll need to schedule a technician to come to your home; there will be a service fee for the call\". Those service calls are always set off at least 3-4 days because they've got so many other calls on their schedule already. I believe that Comcast makes as much money from service calls as it does providing bogus internet services. You'd be better off burning your money in a fireplace to cook with than purchasing internet services from them as both are useless.", "Paid my bill last night for $99.00. Then 9 am this morning service was turned off. For a balance of 120.00. They never said it was going to be turned right back off if I paid my late bill of 99.00. I'm a single dad of 3 teens who I homeschool. I really need the internet service. I pay my bill every month. Late yes but I struggle to pay it. I find it cold and unfair. If I had known they were going to turn my service right back off within 10 hours. I never would have paid the bill until I had the whole bill in total. I could have bought food with that money. And now my kids are out of internet and food. I don't get help from the government. I work. And to keep my kids safe I pay to homeschool them. I had to renew my car insurance this month that's why I was so late. I am one of many who work pay to pay. And struggle. Never would I recommend such a shady company to anyone. Avoid Comcast at all times. Shady company.", "The quality of the internet service is satisfactory, though the speeds they advertise are extremely misleading. My plan is advertised at 75 Mbps bandwidth, but in real world use such as downloading large files I average about 8 Mbps and have never seen it exceed 12 Mbps. Pray you never need to contact their customer service, it is the worst of any company I have ever experienced. Their customer service representatives are very slow and incompetent in nearly all aspects of their job. When you move your service to a new address, Comcast makes you a new account and closes your old one. Of course they don't tell you this.\r\n\r\nNormally this wouldn't be much of an issue except when I moved instead of creating one new account they duplicated my account, creating two new accounts. But they only sent me billing statements for one of the accounts. It wasn't until months later when I got a call from a Collections Agency for the bill of the second account they created in error, that I learned of its existence. I promptly called Comcast. The first rep, whom you could tell English was his second language, had no idea what I was talking about when I informed him about this additional Comcast account that they had created in my name when I moved.\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour he transferred me to another rep in the \"movers\" department who at first thought I was mistaken in claiming there was a billing error. After I repeatedly explained the situation to him and he finally realized that the Comcast rep who moved my service messed up and made a duplicate of my account when I moved. He assured me that I was not responsible for the bill the collections agency had called me about that and that the error was on their end. He told that I would be credited by his supervisor for the balanced on the second account and that it would be closed, further assuring me he would completely resolved the issue.\r\n\r\nWell he was wrong. About a month later I get another bill charging me for unreturned equipment on that second account they created in error in addition to a previous balance. The equipment they were charging me for was still in use on my actual account. As Comcast mistakenly duplicated my one account when I moved to a new apartment, they also duplicated the equipment on my original account. So not only were they charging me twice for the same service, they now were charging me for equipment they never gave me. Upon calling the rep and explaining the situation several times to them, they eventually understood the mistake they had made and once again assured me that it was an error on their part and that I was not responsible for any of the charges. That was yesterday, so I have yet to see if what the rep told me will hold true.\r\n\r\nComcast is lucky they are the only high speed internet provider available at my current address otherwise I would have left them for one of their competitors because of this experience. Unless they demonstrate significant improvement in their customer service I will change to one of their competitors as soon as their service is available at my location. Additionally after I moved to my new apartment I called in to have my service activated at the new address, the first rep could not figure out why they couldn't activate my service frustrated after being on the phone with them for over an hour I asked to speak their supervisor who was finally able to determine that my apartment wasn't patched into Comcast's network.\r\n\r\nOver a two week period they sent two different technicians to my apartment, neither of whom could get my internet working. So I took matters into my own hands, after talking to my apartment managers I was able to gain access to the communications closet at my apartment and patched my room into Comcast's network myself and activated my service over the internet. Accomplishing by myself in 20 minutes what hours of waiting around on two Comcast technicians couldn't. Granted I have an IT background so I was somewhat familiar with comms closets. Maybe I've just had bad luck, but all of the Comcast customer service agents and service technicians I've had contact with have demonstrated moderate to severe incompetence. And for this reason I would purchasing their service if possible.", "We have had problems with pixelation on our TV off and on for at least a year. We have had slow internet for at least 3 years now. I have had several technicians come to the house, new cable boxes and new modems. I had an appointment today set for 4 - 6. I was told they were going to put in a new cable from the post to the house and they were going to bring a new modem.\r\n\r\nThe technician came to the house 4 hours early without calling first. Good thing we were home. It started with him blocking our neighbor's driveway. We asked him to move. He said \"That's ok, I won't be here that long.\" We told him that he was early and from that point things just got worse. We told him that we were supposed to get a new cable from post to house and a new modem. NO on both. He stated that we didn't need a new cable. We needed a amp added to our cable in the house. This was going to help our TV signal. I asked him again about the cable and he said no.\r\n\r\nI called customer service. I told them what was going on and I told the tech that I was talking to customer service. He said he didn't care who I was talking to. I even put him on the phone with customer service. He finally did put a new cable from the pole to the house. He moved my furniture around on his own without asking. The worst is he moved the carpet from under a very heavy cabinet. (No cables are back there) and didn't put it back. I had to do it on my own.\r\n\r\nSo now we get to the internet. I told him that I had gone to Xfinity Speed Check, and got low numbers. He said that he never uses the Xfinity test. He uses some other app. Anyways. He powered down, reset the modem. Checked his speed check app and said it was good. While he was here I showed him how slow it was. It even logged out because it took so long to download. Didn't do anything else. As he was leaving he said \"Do you still want a new modem?\" I said \"Yes.\" He said he would have to go get one. That was 2 1/2 hours ago.\r\n\r\nI called back customer service and explained what happened. They said they couldn't do anything because the ticket was still open. They however would reboot the modem. I told them never mind. This had been done so many times. BTW. My bill is $227 a month. We pay extra for sports channel, Recording box and higher speed. Every time you call you get yessed to death but nothing changes.", "I signed up 2 years ago on 08/08/2015 and yes of course was locked into a 2 year contract. The 30 day money back guarantee is a joke, they do not stand behind the guarantee. When I signed up I was promised a price lock for the 2 years on a contract and was given a complete description of the bundle over the phone with the representative when I agreed to sign up. I was told I would receive an email confirming the agreement and contract. However the email I received was not the same information that was told to me over the phone. While on the phone with the representative I wrote down all the information that was given to me regarding the bundle I signed up for. \r\n\r\nOf course I tried to call that representative back but you never get the same person when you call back and the person who answers the phone will not try to get you over to that person, so you are stuck trying to explain everything to the new representative who promises to fix the issue. They gladly give you their name but names do not matter because no one is held accountable for the errors made or the promises to fix the errors. \r\n\r\nI signed up on 08/08/2015 and tried for several weeks to get these issues resolved but with no success. For the next couple of weeks I was unable to take care of matters because of a family member that tragically passed away and I had to travel to Idaho to take care of family matters. Upon returning I tried again to get issues resolved and finally reached an executive in the company who issued a credit to us and got the issue resolved and everything was good for about 3 months and then it all started all over again from there. Every 2 months I was receiving a bill for more and more and more. It started out that I would be paying $119.00 per month for 2 years which included a home security monitoring system for the additional per month or my package would of only been $109.00 per month. \r\n\r\nI tried to understand the first couple months of billing as they were telling me that there was a pro-ration, then they were saying that there is a separate charge for everything on top of the $119.00. Even though my package bundle stated it included HD services they were still billing me $10.00 per month for HD services. I called and called and called, they would promise to fix the bill which would last 1 to 2 months then it would start all over again. Everytime I would call it would waste over an hour of my time with promises of resolve, yet nothing would ever get fixed. \r\n\r\nMy home security system worked for about 2 months then it would stop working, techs would come out to fix it but fix would only last about a week, so those service calls ended up being a complete waste of time, they never could get it to work, but I was locked into a contract for 2 years even if it didn't work. My bill went from a promised 2 year price of $119.00 per month to $171.00 per month. They said I would pay a penalty to break my contract but they didn't have to stick to their end of the contract, they could raise their prices anytime they wanted to. \r\n\r\nWell my contract is up On August 8, 2017, I received my new bill on July 31, 2017 showing the new price would be $207.23 per month and bill was for period 08/08/2017 to 09/07/2017. I called to have my services cancelled and turned off on 08/07/2017 at midnight because I had already paid through 08/07/2017. I received a call from the home security company showing that my monitor had been disconnected, out of courtesy, I called them back to let them know I cancelled my entire Xfinity account effective midnight 08/07/2017. They informed me that there was another error. It had been scheduled for 08/12/2017. \r\n\r\nI called back Xfinity and spent over 2 hours on the phone with them to get the disconnect date corrected. I know sooner hung up with them and they disconnected me right that moment. I called them back again because I was entitled to my cable through 08/07/2017, as I had already paid through that date. They refused to turn it back on until midnight without a reconnect fee. It was their error not following my instructions for disconnect time and date, not mine. I will also be filing a complaint with Better Business Bureau as no one should ever be treated this way or companies not standing behind their prices and or contracts. This review is true and all names and dates have been documented for verification.", "I was very happy in getting our internet at first. The service was great. However, I stay up very late. However, the internet stops working after 11:00 PCT. It also doesn't start back up before 8:00 PCT. No parental controls were made. They even charged me extra for the local TV. I didn't want it. I had a NVidia Shield TV. I asked them why they charged me this extra 60 bucks. They said you need to have it in this area. It is the law. I was like WHAT? Just think. If this happened to me, then it would happen to others too. They can make thousands of dollars from scamming people. So please make sure you trust your installer or just don't use this provider. ** you Comcast.", "So I recently purchased Comcast internet (I had no choice) and I wanted to use my surfboard modem that I had used with them before and I know is working. I call customer service to activate it and the first person says I can't because it is stuck to an old account and they need to \"escalate it\" to move it. Ok not waiting 3 days. Next call I ask the same question and this lady asks how do I like my service. My response is, \"Ma'am I have no internet, how do you think it is?\" After her saying \"ummmm\" 1000 times she says I have to wait 5 days til they activate it and I should buy their 2 in one modem router combo instead. I said, \"No I have been through 3 of your modem router combos as they are poorly refurbished nightmares that overheat.\" I hang up and go to the next call.\r\n\r\nNext call is a lady who tries to activate it, she says \"I can't activate it but if you bring it to the store they can.\" And now I'm going to the store tomorrow so they can manually add the Mac address so I can use my internet. I am paying for nothing right now, I know my modem works as it did before. If you have an option to not use Comcast, take that option every time.", "If you can get customer service reps you can understand and who aren't robotically reciting protocol no matter what you're telling them each time you call, you're having better luck than most. I've been on calls and chats for hours with them THIS time around, as have been losing connection for hours at a time. Their latest scheme is to \"escalate\" your complaint after you've spent hours with their support people and have ultimately scheduled a technician to come out. At that point, someone miraculously \"solves\" the problem, connectivity comes back on, and they call you to tell you \"it's not Comcast\". It's Comcast.\r\n\r\nSo then they tell you that you don't need a tech appointment (one they plan to charge you for), but then the same issue happens in a week or two and it's the entire process all over again. Tomorrow the technician will come out and say they can find nothing wrong and it's not Comcast. Again. And I'll be here with a houseful of visitors with teenagers and have no internet service. I despise this company and wish someone with far more money than I would file a class action suit on behalf of all of us who have put massive amounts of time trying to resolve problems.", "They need to do better with the customer service team at Comcast. They want to always send a technician over to see what the problem is and charge you on top of that. I called Comcast because the internet is very slow. I'm paying money to them every month and I'm literally sitting by my modem to get connection. My kids can't even watch movie from Netflix and the modem is right next to the box. I am sorry but I had to hang up on the lady because she sound like she's going off a script. They don't have one person that can help me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had the technician come out to hook my service up and then 3 guys showed up. OKAY. They were supposed to connect the internet and TV. They came and they are looking around. One suggested the attic and the other one suggested running the cord somewhere else. I was standing outside for hours with my dogs because one of them was scared of dogs. My dogs are in the backyard. Why I had to hold them outside for a long time, don't know. But my dogs are not harmful - they were puppies. \r\n\r\nThen, they complain about spiders and lizards. Then they wanted me to get them water and how hot the attic is. I had to move my car out the garage for him to go to the attic. And in the end he didn't run the cord through the attic. Still I was outside the whole day, outside with the dogs wasting my time when I had a 9 month old baby in the house to tend to. \r\n\r\nI told these people I had Comcast before. They could see where to run the cord if they would put their thinking caps on. 3 men and no one could think running the cord around the house all that time. It should not be that hard to run 1 wire to a room. I was so uncomfortable having these people in my house. If I had the option I would do it myself. So still no one connected my internet until I brought it up. They said they have to get home because it's the end of their shift or day as they say. Like really. I would not even recommend Comcast to my worst enemy.", "******** NOTE TO APPROVER: https://comcast.pissedconsumer.com/it-s-lies-lies-it-s-all-lies-201708061084138.html ********\r\n\r\nMy complaint is on numerous types: customer service issues, contract issues, service issues, repair issues. My mother moved to ocklawaha in August 2016- was referred to Comcast/xfinity by the electric company here in zip code 32179 and so she called and had the service connected on 8-16-16 and since then has not been able to reliably use her cable or internet service. I visited her monthly from Aug - Dec. and every time I came her service was giving her issues, I told her to call, she said she had called and was resorting to restarting the router every time she had issues. I move here in Jan 2017 and just as I had expected the service was horrible I called multiple times but working an hour away and having super busy schedules it was not top priority. Mom called numerous times and they even sent her to exchange the hardware in or around March. In April (Easter weekend) my mother called and spoke to a representative for approx 2 hours and the representative said that he was going to escalate these concerns to a supervisor and that a supervisor would be contacting her - that never happened, she received a call saying a tech would be out to make repairs -4 hours after that she called the tech directly and told him the srvc was still not working properly. I then called the week of July 4th and spoke to the rep about the on going issues and was told her could see the fact that the service was continually in and out, in and out. I also asked the rep about a credit and he told me to wait until the issues were resolved and then to call back A technician was out the morning of July 3rd or 4th repaired the issue correctly. The service has. Even good since then spoke to a representative 24 hours later and they had promised a 3 month credit and now as of 8/62017 they are telling me they did not promise this to me and they will only provide 2 months and the recorded conversation that I had with said representative was conveniently cut off where the promises were made.", "Had Comcast previously, then went to Direct for several years, decided to return to Comcast and already internet failure box failure, services pay for can't get. When you call in after 15 minutes of getting through the very limited option computer answering service, finally a human to speak to, I ordered the boxes the recommended yet only receive half channel I am paying for so now they say, \"Sir you need to upgrade your box service to get those channels,\" but I already am paying 10 per box and paying for these channels. To me this whole thing is a scam, I ordered these channels and paying for them, \"But hey if you want actually watch what you pay for give us even more money,\" so will be paying a extra 50 to get service already paid for. Then I get a bill that is due 8 days after the service was installed. Very crooked company! Understand the poor ratings.", "USE ANOTHER COMPANY! COMCAST CANNOT HANDLE ITS NEW TECHNOLOGY! BILLING AND RECORDS SYSTEMS ARE AWFUL! I want the $60 service charges removed from my bills! (Received notice of credit, but was not reflected on bill balance). I want to be able to see my bills or get one mailed to the correct address! I want my billing address corrected! I want the service I ordered installed completed! I want my bill to reflect my actual disconnect and installation days! I want my bills to reflect the actual equipment at each location!\r\n\r\nSince 1992 I have had service in one my current homes provided by same company, with many different names which have morphed into the name of COMCAST. Soon it seems to become XFINITY. Through the years, one thing has been apparent, there is very little concern to provide contact with \"customer service\" that is anything remotely a pleasant experience for the \"paying customer\". Must be in quiet area or voice recognition will send you into \"NEVER, NEVER LAND\". It takes me almost three minutes to get a service person on the line, they apologize, assure me that they are different & my issues are still unresolved. When I call again, I have to start all over again because the notes from the previous call are not there or are not complete and they act as if it were my fault.\r\n\r\nI have a long list of ideas for improvement but it seems that the only thing COMCAST will eventually understand is the MASS exodus of THEIR customers which, based on ALL of my recent contacts, will happen soon. Some form of this entity has been bankrupted before and larger companies have failed! My internet service is critical. I am disabled supplementing my income with occasional jobs from home. I have been without this income for over a month! For the last two months, because of service issues CAUSED BY OTHER UTILITIES, my internet service has been basically non-existent. Over eleven (11) hours, yes hours I have spent on the phone with your \"customer service\". There are at least 3-4 more hours not listed! Many of my issues are still unresolved.\r\n\r\nI have a life and spending this much time with COMCAST is unacceptable especially since I do not see an end in sight! I have another account for my parents which was to be moved and that service is STILL incomplete! Billing information is incorrect and I was assured this was corrected! I cannot see the bill because of this issue also!!! I have requested a paper bill to no avail!", "Comcast is the worst company to deal with. Every single day I've dealt with these people and nothing gets done. I've paid well over 300 dollars in technician fees for nothing. Then one tech comes out and is here for maybe ten minutes and says my whole apartment complex needs to be rewired. He told me that Comcast would have to pay for it because they wired the building completely wrong. He tells me that there isn't much he can do to fix it that he isn't that skilled to fix such a problem. He leaves without giving me any contact info or anything on how to get this resolved. \r\n\r\nI call Comcast the next day to see when the reworking can take place. Turns out I'm expected to cover the rewiring even though I'm RENTING in an apartment! I say no way and even if I wanted to I can't afford it! This goes on for WEEKS. I finally get someone who tells me all they can do is send out ANOTHER tech to see if there is a way to \"fix\" it without rewiring. BUT WHY didn't the last tech do that then?! So of course I refuse! Now for MONTHS I've had service that is so inconsistent I would cancel if I wasn't in contract. I try to call to get money taken off my bill for not having a solid service and the lady tells me they can't give me a discount because I still have SOME wifi connection throughout the day. \r\n\r\nWHAT?! So we argue and then she transfers me to a man so now I have to tell this story all over again and this time he tells me he is a MANAGER so he can help me better! Well his solution to this long process is that I should MOVE APARTMENTS. Yes that's right, he told me that I should move so hopefully it will get better. These people are nuts and they\u2019re driving me nuts just putting up with them. I'm losing my mind with these people. DO NOT get Comcast EVER. They are liars, no one wants to deal with the problem at hand and they will do whatever they can to get more money out of you!!! To this day my internet is not fixed. The minute my contract is up I'm switching providers. Do yourself a favor and don't deal with Comcast. They are disgusting.", "I told Comcast that we could not find a cable outlet in our house and that we would need a technician to come install one or help us find one. The Comcast technician came, stood in my doorway, asked me what the problem was (should he not already know?). I told him we could not find an outlet to install our router to. He did not leave the doorway, did not offer to look, he simply spouted out something about needing a letter on letterhead for permission to install. He then said he had to look up something. He then went to his truck and drove away without saying goodbye. I WAITED TWO HOURS ON A SATURDAY FOR THIS GUY. The next guy can't come until Tuesday which I will have to come home early from work for. LIKE WHAT. NO. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I cannot wait for Google Fiber to come to my neighborhood so I can switch over as soon as possible.", "Over the last 2 years we continue to have the worst service with this company, and they are the only one that serves our area - so we are stuck. They have: 1.) Set us up with the wrong packages (took 3 times to fix). (All Spanish channels. We don't speak Spanish.) 2.) Payment issues with not processing in the early year. 3.) Upgrading service but they never show up and when you call them there is no notes regarding this & they never did it - the only way we could prove something was done was by a payment processed to my son's credit card (we had to produce the receipt too). 4.) They double processed 2 payments but then wouldn't refund 1 of them. We had to call bank to stop payment on them. Now we can't make any debit/credit card payments for 6 months. \r\n\r\n5.) Made a payment on the phone with a routing number; received an email that said it was received, 10 days later money still in bank (bank shows it was never pulled) and they cut off our service for nonpayment/bounced charge. Nobody on phone line helpful. Had to go to store. Pay with money order. We removed all credit card info and bank info at this time. \r\n\r\n6.) Last payment made on Saturday, on Monday they went ahead and took the same payment we made out of the checking account causing our account to go negative by over $100. If everything removed, how did they do this. Payment was paid, nothing due until 12/9. We are having to fix this today now. They are the worst internet/cable service I have experienced in 20 years. They are rude, half the time you don't get an English speaking person, they can never resolve an issue - they claim it is always your fault. The minute we get a new company here, we are discontinuing service.", "We're a small business - just 2 people. Back in June, we were moving to a larger warehouse. We had CenturyLink - one of THE WORST telecom companies in the country. I wanted to dump them. Overpriced, bad service, incompetent, etc. The new location was in a section of the city that had not been updated. I had assumed that I'd have a choice for service, but that wasn't the case. Turns out that I had only 2 choices: CenturyLink or Comcast. Crap and Crappier. I decided to go with Comcast since they were cheaper. \r\n\r\nGetting these clowns in to install was a disaster! They wasted time with 'inspection, to see if they can provide service' at our office. I told them the place next door to me uses them. They still wasted a week for inspections. Scheduling a time for install was equally disastrous - 2 weeks out! NOW - the install tech is here. He's telling me that all he can do is 'turn on' the internet. Since we don't have wireless computers, I'll have to hire someone to come in with about 100 ft. of co-ax cable and hook our 2 desktops up! This is ridiculous! I have to pay those idiots at Comcast for install, and *now* I have to pay someone else to finish it?! COMCAST SUCKS!", "I pay way too much a month for my internet and cable not to work all the time. I go to school online so I need to be able to access my classes. They have to send a technician out every 2 weeks to work on it. I would recommend getting another service provider.", "Don't know why Comcast is hiring representatives from India. Maybe it gonna cheap to hire Indian people. They always provide name as like alex, john, justin. I am pretty much sure they not gonna have a name like that. I tried to take a comcast service. I did contact them 4, 5 times in 3 days but didn't get the good response. 1st I got the confirmation number. After 3 days they rejected my service. I wasted my 3 days to get the service from comcast. When I call customer service I feel like they are doing exercise and talking with me, taking a long breath. Don't know and told me to call different no. Comcast service suck and hire the people for cheap and they don't know what they are doing.", "I refuse to ever get their service again. They manipulated people into getting service packs and internet is shared with others. They don't tell people at all. They upsell and lie about the speed you get mbps... internet drops out randomly from hard lined to router. Calling in is a joke! You get to talk to someone who can barely speak English. On top of that they put you on hold for more than 10 mins. Then to be told they don't know what the problem is. Very bad service and internet provider. 175 mbps is a lie when it's shared with others and they will charge you a arm and leg for their fines and fees and startup cost. When expecting to pay 100 first month I get almost 275 bill... When I got 2 weeks of service and it got dropped out for week and half just to be told that Denver server was out. And they refund credit but almost two weeks no service. \r\n\r\nThe new month rolls around. I call to complain and explain what's going on and it's not fair no one cares to listen and I'm just told \"well you need to pay your bill.\" So 275 for two weeks of service from them?? Yea right. These people get a FAT F and a 0! For everything go with CenturyLink. They don't share service. It's DSL... For your internet and the customer service is a lot better.

They need to learn and fix their whole business! And reps!!", "I have been having connectivity problems with my modem/wireless internet for over 6 months. Today, my life was made so much easier by a very knowledgeable associate at Xfinity. Timothy was patient with my complaint (remember there is 6 months of annoyance built up) and not only fixed my problem but educated me on which frequency to connect to - and why.", "My very real - and very sad - experience with Comcast. I have never felt compelled to share negative experiences I\u2019ve had with service providers publicly. I am not a complainer, I am not a radical. I am simply a guy who likes to make well informed decisions and expects to get what he paid for. Here is my Comcast horror story:\r\n\r\nJuly 24, 2017. My wife signed up for Comcast service for our new home. Go to Comcast location to pick up equipment to do self install. Bring equipment home, visit Walmart store for back to school shopping. Xfinity representatives are in Walmart offering \u201csuper deal\u201d, I say \u201cno thanks, I already signed up this morning.\u201d He offers to compare his Xfinity promotion with what I got. Amazingly his Walmart/Xfinity promotion is better by $20 per month. I think it over and saving $20/month is worth investigating so I called Comcast at 800-934-6489 to see if they would match the Walmart promotion. I was told \u201cNO\u201d they would not. I then asked if I could cancel my order for service since it has not been hooked up. She said \u201cYES\u201d, so I cancelled my Comcast service. I grabbed all the equipment to return to their location so I could start all over with Walmart and save $240 for the year.\r\n\r\nJust before returning the equipment I called Comcast at 800-934-6489 just to be absolutely certain they cancelled me from the system because I recall the Walmart deal was only for \u201cnew customers\u201d and I didn\u2019t want an issue when I got there. Prizel answered the phone. Prizel verified that the order was indeed cancelled and asked why I chose to cancel so soon. I explained the better deal and SHE OFFERED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING SHE COULD DO TO HONOR THE LOWER RATE AND KEEP ME FROM GOING THROUGH ALL THE HASSLE I WAS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH. I said \u201csure\u201d and she tried and tried and asked if she could put me on hold while she checked some things out. I agreed. The call dropped (I was experiencing horrible cell service in that location). Initial call was 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nPrizel called me back a few minutes later from phone# 800-266-2278. She was working on overriding the system to get me the better deal. This call lasted 12 minutes as she tried and tried, then the call dropped again. Prizel called back from phone# 800-266-2278 to continue assisting me. This is when Prizel said she figured out a way to get me the lower monthly rate but she had to show it as a $20 monthly special discount or override. I clarified that I would be getting the exact same deal that the Xfinity reps at Walmart were offering and she confirmed that was the case. I thanked her for the great service and going to great lengths to get me the better promotion and saving me having to go back to Walmart to sign up. I happily drove home to set up my new equipment. My conversations with Prizel totalled approximately 41 minutes.\r\n\r\nAt 8:55 pm, after setting up all the equipment and getting ready to enjoy my new internet and TV service I called the self activation service for Comcast at 866-512-2218. I have activated service with AT&T, Bright House, and others over the last few years so I know this process takes only a few minutes. WRONG!! I was assisted by a female technician with a very heavy Indian accent. It was extremely challenging to understand her, but I was patient... Very patient. This call lasted 86 MINUTES and the tech was unable to activate my service. Very frustrating. She told me that they would have to send a technician to my home to hook it up because for some reason she was unable to. That\u2019s an hour and a half!!! And no service.\r\n\r\nMy wife couldn\u2019t believe it could be that hard and tried calling back to see if she would have any better luck. She called 855-652-3446 and spent 41 MINUTES with a different technician who also experienced difficulties and COULD NOT ACTIVATE OUR SERVICE. This technician said the only way to activate us was to send a technician out to our home. The next morning the technician arrived, surveyed the situation and concluded that there was no way the tech over the phone would be able to get us activated. THEIR EQUIPMENT WAS OUTDATED AND INOPERABLE requiring him to replace it. Now this was not the equipment I received from the store. No. It was the equipment inside the service box INSIDE THE WALL - equipment I could no way affect at all.\r\n\r\nFinally our service was working. Awesome. I received my first bill and was surprised to see I was being charged the higher rate, not the rate Prizel told me she secured for me. I spent over 40 minutes on the phone with her and she told me she secured the Walmart promotion for me. Furthermore, there was a $60 activation/service call fee on my bill. THEY CHARGE ME FOR THE TECHNICIAN TO COME OUT BECAUSE THEIR IN-THE-WALL EQUIPMENT WAS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ME SERVICE!!\r\n\r\nI called Comcast thinking it was all just an oversight and would be cleared up quickly. WRONG AGAIN! I talked to the \u201ccustomer dis-service\u201d rep for quite a while explaining what I had gone through and was met with heavy skepticism at best. I was dismissed and treated like I was trying to cheat them. By the end of the call I demanded to be called by someone who could make the correction, not someone who would only quote the policy book to me.\r\n\r\nSeveral calls later I was not any closer to resolving what had become quite a big issue. That is when I lodged a complaint with the BBB as well as the FTC - something I have never done in my entire life! I also posted a negative review on several sites as well as Comcast's own FaceBook page. Well, at least that got me some attention. Still no help though. Then I received a call from TIFFANY **, EXECUTIVE CUSTOMER RELATIONS, **. We played some phone tag and I did get the opportunity to talk to some other people at Comcast with absolutely no success whatsoever. I have been treated as a liar and a thief.\r\n\r\nI even talked to Renita of Greater Chicago, apparently a customer service guru. She dismissed my account of what had happened to me and kept quoting the rate I was going to get - the higher rate. I demanded that they go back and listen to the recordings of the phone call with Prizel to hear exactly what happened. She finally agreed to do that but told me - now get this - if they found that I was correct and was guaranteed the lower rate by Prizel they would issue me a MISINFORMATION STATEMENT. Got that\u2026 A misinformation statement. In other words, they still would not honor the lower rate for me but would admit that their employee had misinformed me. Can you imagine???\r\n\r\nI demanded to talk to someone who could help me, Renita told me someone would call. A couple days later I did receive a call from a gentleman whose name I have misplaced. He told me that he went back and listened to my call with Prizel and that she did not offer me the lower price at all. He did hear that the call had dropped though. Well, he was right, Prizel did not find the solution on the first call, it was the third call (remember she called me back twice). He told me that SHE DID NOT CALL ME BACK, THAT THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF HER CALLING ME ON THAT DAY!!! So he called me a liar!!\r\n\r\nI have pulled my phone records and have a log of all the calls that were placed and received. I have the proof that Prizel indeed called me back twice that day. Finally, I received a letter that Tiffany ** sent to the BBB and the FTC saying that she explained the charges on my bill to me and that everything has been handled as far as they are concerned. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading. They dismissed me entirely, they essentially called me a liar, and all they ever did is quote me what they were going to charge me no matter what.\r\n\r\nDismayed, I called Tiffany ** to tell her how terribly unhappy I was with Comcast.

Negative energy does not serve me and I do not want to associate with a company that lacks morals and ethics from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nShe did not return my call. She had an associate call me to say if I had any further questions to call Tiffany. So I called Tiffany again, and left another message asking to disassociate myself from Comcast. I feel parting ways is the only solution acceptable to both parties. I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED A CALLBACK FROM TIFFANY **, EXECUTIVE CUSTOMER RELATIONS. So I called AT&T who happily (and without a $60 install fee) came out and set up my new service with them yesterday. I am about to return all of my equipment to the local Comcast location.\r\n\r\nI am very curious to see how Comcast handles my cancelling their service. I\u2019m sure they will want to send me to a collection agency, which I will fight. I have all the proof of the phone calls made. I have proof that their self activation technicians could not activate my service after over two hours of trying on the night of July 24th. I have proof that I called Tiffany ** twice last week and she has decided to not call me back. All I want at this point is to part ways amicably.

Thinking that it was all over and I would receive a full refund, I continued to get phone calls from agents trying to get me to upgrade my service. The final chapter was a bill stating that I would only receive $46.78 of my initial upfront deposit of $50.00.

When I went in to pay my bills, there was ALWAYS an elderly person in front of me confused about why their service had changed and they were being charged more for less of what they wanted. When we got the higher speed internet, it only ACTUALLY gave us the lower speed - and when we talked to them about it after several attempts to fix it, the lady told me they didn't actually have to deliver the promised speeds. That it could be \"up to\" the promised speeds, but they weren't going to care anymore about the issue. Automatic billing is a trap, so is renting their equipment. Because they up the charges without warning every few months, and the equipment can, apparently, be outdated for the service you are getting without two technicians coming to your house and NOTICING THAT FACT.\r\n\r\nBut now? Oh, now it's WORSE. Because I'm renting. And when we set up the internet, the problem was on their end. They admitted it on the phone and in person. But they took OVER A WEEK to show up, even though I told them that I work from home and needed the hours/paycheck. They did not refund the 180 I lost in income during that week and made it sound like a favor not charging us for the time we didn't have their service. \r\n\r\nAnd NOW I'm losing another 100 dollars because of losing the connection for about a second every minute or two. Nothing wrong in their system, they say. And if the technician comes out and sees that it's not their fault, we'll have to get charged for that too. Even though I've checked multiple computers and multiple networks, and it is very clearly an internet connection on their end. And the worst part is that the company is SO bad it's afraid of any sort of competition in the area, and has a stranglehold monopoly on my livelihood.

This is like the old Comcast that lost signals in the 90s. I guess we are back to the same scenario. Customer service is poor at best especially when you request an English speaking representative with no results and find yourself screaming which is unbecoming.

She also told us we could stream using an app on our PlayStation4, she guaranteed it... IT DOESN'T EXIST. So she changed our agreement, we agreed to pay the, what, $72, this month we were charged for some \"partial month fee\", that we were never told about. They told us that there will be NO EXTRA charges for adding the stupid streaming service that we can't even use! So anyway, we got charged $94. Let me spell it out for you, NINETY FOUR DOLLARS. So we called up, lady said, \"Oh, we'll fix it. No problem.\" It wasn't fixed. Nothing happened. \r\n\r\nSo today we called again and talked to Joe, who claimed to be a supervisor, for 40 minutes. Trying to convince us that it was right, and we were not manipulated or lied to, and everything was correct. We talked and yelled and screamed, but, in the end, we are WRONG. We insisted on talking to his manager for 40 minutes, and finally I got him to send us to Ivan, badge number **, who also said he was a supervisor. He also did nothing. Kept trying to explain this mysterious fee, that no one could explain clearly. He also said we could not get charged for adding this service, we had paid September in full, said there was a refund, (there wasn't.) Kept on insisting we look at the bill as we already had been. The bill didn't explain the partial fee, just said there was one.\r\n\r\nI asked him specifically if he was going to do anything to help me, since his employees ALL told us something different, and none of them seemed to know what was actually going on. He tried to explain it all again, and I said, \"No. it's a yes or no question. Are you going to help me, or not.\" He said, \"There is nothing to help with, since the bill is right.\" They had no one come over, nothing changed, except the stupid streaming service.\r\n\r\nYou've got to be kidding me. By this time it had been an hour, and we had to leave for work. So I got his name, Ivan, Badge number **, and his managers name, Rupen. (But who knows, they're probably lying about this too.)

Thus all causing him to be LATE FOR WORK, and losing his composure.\r\n\r\nThey also have a lock on our box, so we couldn't get a different internet service, which is why we chose Xfinity, to avoid the hassle.

All I wanted to do is have the service that I signed up for 1 year ago and use the modem I purchase from a trusted merchant with Amazon. The merchant I purchased from sent me a new modem and new serial number, to activate with Comcast. I spent more than an hour on the phone setting up a promotion and service, then I was transferred to activation's and Fabian (Customer Relations Executive) flagged the modem as damaged product and the activation's agent could not activate the modem. I then had to reach out to the merchant and let them know and I have now exhausted all options by trying to get my service back on with this modem. He sent me a return label and said he will refund once the equipment is returned. \r\n\r\nThis dispute has gone on for a month and a half. Not only is Comcast greedy, they dumb down the customer service agents and as for Fabian in customer relations does not act like a Customer Relations Specialist. He acts more of a Drill Sergeant instead of Customer Relations. He didn't connect with sincerity or understand about my situation. In fact he caused me to feel as though I am a criminal and a thief. I hope someday Fabian and others in the Comcast company realize assuming the worst of people is not the way to address a situation. Out of all the agents I spoke with at Comcast in regards to the modem I purchased and the equipment charge I received 1 year later, I expected professionalism with proper explanation. \r\n\r\nI sent Fabian the receipt, the name and phone number of the company and the fact that Amazon has provisions against fraud.

This is an example of a company that should have been prosecuted to the full extent of the law years ago. Not only was the service terrible, not only did they engage in an \"area update\" that eliminated all service on my second day, not only did they fail to provide an adequate means of online payments, but when I asked to terminate the account, their representative, a \"Virtual Agent\" named Howard who works from home presumably because of his splendid people skills, clearly lied to me and told me cancellation would be easy, and had in fact occurred when I paid my unpaid balance.\r\n\r\nI admit I fouled up. I had trouble using their online auto payment option, and perhaps a more tech savvy customer would not. But that is not my regret. My belief is that I should have cancelled on the second day when their \"area update\" took away my paid internet. That told me all I needed to know about this company. But more damningly, I should have demanded something in writing from Howard to terminate my account, and even now after getting a second agent, Ellie, to say she has terminated my account, I have my doubts.\r\n\r\nThey commit fraud. As soon as I made final payments, they secretly 'reactivated' my account because I had paid. Howard told me my account was terminated. Howard lied. Today, nearly half a month later, I received a call from customer service who wanted me to upgrade an account I had assumed was done. Comcast's \"reactivation of non paid disconnection status accounts\" is a fraudulent program made to leech money off of people who have trouble using a substandard online payments option.

Whether the issue be caused because of the wiring outside, your modem, maybe some wiring inside your building, they'll send a different kind of technician. \r\n\r\nAt least that's what I've been told by their department. But the technicians don't matter in my case. This problem is intermittent. The internet will get slow or stop working, I'll call them, they set up an appointment for another day (maybe 2-3 days later because for whatever reason they can never send one out the next day) and the issue won't happen when they come. I've had this happen maybe twice and since there's no problem when they come, they can't diagnose the issue and fix it. They tend to update outages pretty late as well so maybe there are multiple mini outages that occur and fix so the outage notification doesn't even pop up on the mobile app.\r\n\r\nI keep getting slow internet speeds intermittently and nobody knows how to fix it besides the tech support guy saying that they're sending a provisioning (?) signal to my modem. Not sure why you have to keep sending those kinds of signals in order for my internet to work properly but okay. Some of the tech support members don't know what the hell they're talking about and have no idea what the issue with the internet is. I called roughly a month ago because my internet kept dropping every 15 minutes or so and some idiot told me that the signal from Comcast to my apartment building was strong and just fine and that it must be an issue with my modem/router. They insisted that this was the issue, and since every single time I called they said that it might be my modem since there's no possible way that their end could do any wrong, I decided to take the rep's advice and call NetGear to get some help. \r\n\r\nDon't know why I listened to him when he said that NetGear helps for free because it cost me $100. But beyond that, after I agree to pay the $100 to find out what's going on, NetGear tells me that my modem/router is working just fine. Just to make sure that this information is correct, I buy another modem/router ($150) just to confirm if this is true and lo and behold my internet still wasn't working as it should've been. To top this whole ordeal off, I get a call a couple days later telling me that they fixed the internet issue and that it was their signal that was the issue, not my modem/router. So now I'm in the process of getting Comcast to reimburse me for the $100 that I paid NetGear. Obviously NetGear can't refund me because they gave me information that \"helped\" me with my issue that they can't take back.", "I recommend all should formally submit an FCC complaint. Date of letter August 28, 2017 from Comcast (aka Xfinity) stated, \"You will be charged an equipment fee of 11.00 a month\". I called 1-800-Xfinity when I received the letter on September 6th and spoke to Shane, ticket # **. I was informed Comcast sent the letter in error and to ignore and pay my 39.99 payment as usual and I will see a credit on my next statement. He also informed me he will transfer me to the IT dept. to update my modem because I purchased my equipment. He attempted to transfer me to the IT dept once we were done and my call kept coming back to Shane and when it happened the second time, I informed Shane I am waiting to update my equipment with IT as you directed me. He then changed his direction and said I don't need to speak with them and everything has been resolved.\r\n\r\nI paid my bill and 2 weeks later received another bill and it still had the equipment charge on it. So I called again on about Oct 10th and an agent transferred me to the loyalty dept. because the charge is for a promotion that ended and I was confused because this is a different issue than the equipment charge, when I signed up in Aug. 2016. I had a choice of 29.99 plan with a contract or 39.99 without and since I chose 39.99 plan I informed the agent I would like to stay on the plan. He then transferred me to Josh in the Loyalty dept. in which was not helpful and informed me of the difference between a contract and a promotion which can end in 12 mos. Josh didn't offer me anything and I thought this was unprofessional of him.\r\n\r\nI wrote to the BBB a complaint and received a VM on Oct. 13th from Fabian (Executive Customer Relations 4 West Division). I emailed him \"I will call him on my next available day off Oct 17th\" because it appears we work similar hours. I informed Fabian about the higher bill I been receiving and I was informed by Shane it was resolved. Fabian explained the difference between a promotion and a contract. Fabian failed to connect with me as a customer, there was no empathy or sympathy for the confusion and frustration as I am having to call back several times and speak with different people that have different answers. Then Fabian informed me, he researched back and found that there is equipment from Comcast. I advised I purchased the equipment when I set up service Aug. 2016 and I should not have an equipment charge since I purchased my equipment.\r\n\r\nFabian informed me that because someone didn't return the equipment and sold it online, I am obligated to pay the monthly rental and proceeded to offer me a promotion and equipment rental plan. I informed him I am not responsible for other people failing to return equipment and I purchased new at Amazon. He indicated the equipment was sold online and I made a choice to purchase it. Fabian was not listening or giving instructions how I can redeem this equipment is legitimate, he was assuming I am committing the same violations as other people that don't return their equipment and I felt very victimized by his arrogance. I informed him that I am being forced to write to the FCC and Fabian advised me it will reach him and he will tell me the same thing and he cancelled my service. So I emailed him and asked for the serial number for the stolen equipment and it matched the serial number on the equipment I have.\r\n\r\nI then reached out to the company I purchased from on Amazon called DOCSIS and the sales MGR Karen ** opened a case to reach out to their vendor with Comcast to resolve and it should take 10 or more days. I feel I should not have to be without service for this lengthy time. I do work on my computer and I am now in a hardship situation. I feel Fabian should have looked further into a resolution on the Comcast end to ensure they have the proper information and fixed it instead of cutting off my service. Fabian may deal with a lot of people that don't return Comcast equipment and I have no control over that I purchased my equipment from a trusted source and Fabian has the power and resources to confirm and fix it, instead he victimized a customer, I feel Fabian is abusing his position.\r\n\r\nThe over 1500 complaints I saw at the BBB site is appalling and should be taken seriously. If I had a choice to use another internet service provider I would but that is not possible because Comcast made sure they contracted the geographical area. The Company I purchased from is DOCSIS ID ** Arris CM820A Cable Modem and the phone number is ** Account Sales MGR Karen **.", "Forgetting about the cost of the service, when it is working, it's great. When it stops, for whatever reason, the problems often can't be overcome quickly. It takes a minimum of 30 minutes of talking with one to three techs before any issue can be resolved... Often it's more. Some folks have good expertise, others do not or are from a different culture and just don't understand requests.", "I work from home and I've had to call Xfinity/Comcast so many times until I've lost count! They've told me that there was a node destroyed by the storm and they're trying to repair it, mind you it's been over 2 mos since the storm they're referring caused the damage! They give me a $4 credit for the day but I lose ALL of my services not just the internet! You select for a text message to be sent once resolved to only learn that the service still isn't working because you try to get back to work and lose service again. They have now given me the number directly to advanced tech support but for what you can't troubleshoot an issue that's affecting an entire region. Then they tell me unfortunately we don't know when you could lose service or how long.\r\n\r\nNow if this is an actual repair why can't it be scheduled, why do they keep trying to repair when it seems like they need to just replace it because their repairs definitely aren't working. Then the first thing they say is they have their advanced skilled technicians working to resolve as quick as possible. Do you know how tired I am of hearing that. They hurriedly started my contract over because I moved after I had already completed a year of my current contract stating since I'm moving it requires a new contract BS!!!\r\n\r\nNow when I try to find another service Comcast is the only one in this area! Now why do I have to be subjected to their poor unreliable service because of where I live??? This is so UNFAIR on so many levels. All of last week I've missed work and guess what I've missed the first 2 days this week already. They've put in a new modem just last week now this week it's a known issue with my downstream and they're sending a tech out today but no one has given me a permanent resolution on when this node will be permanently fixed. It's like they're trying to do other little small stuff to distract me from the REAL issue. Even if they put in a new modem, fix the downstream none of that matters if I can still lose ALL of my services at anytime due to this supposedly node issue they have going on that can impact all of your services indefinitely!!! This service is straight GARBAGE!!!", "I had a payment arrangement set up for 10/27 and I spoke to an agent named \"Akhileshk\" to cancel it a whole day before on 10/26. The agent I spoke with told the arrangement was canceled and I would not be charged. Well what do you know, next morning I woke up and the entire money was withdrawn!!! I contacted Comcast customer service via chat and requested a refund for the full amount and next thing they tell me is \"contact your bank to cancel transaction\" as Comcast cannot refund the amount. \r\n\r\nI know how banks work and they cannot \"Cancel\" transactions that are pending. It's all up to the merchant \"Comcast\" to refund the money back to my card. It literally took a supervisor to FINALLY tell me that they CAN refund the amount but will take 5-7 business days for the money to be returned to my account. This should've never happened in the first place. Now I am the one that is having to deal with my bank to see if I can get the money temporarily put back into my account. HUGE INCONVENIENCE. Also, when I spoke to the supervisor he has told there was notes from the agent that I spoke with on 10/26. Bottom Line. Do not do business with Comcast. I have had so many issues with them in the past as well. They treat their customers very poorly.", "We've had Xfinity for about four years. I live in Tooele so our options are limited. We can't just switch. However, I work from home and my internet is how I work. At least once a month my internet will be down and I will call the line and hear that the service is down and that it will be up at such and such time. This morning it was supposed to be up at 10. But I just called because it's 10 and it's not up, and now it's not going to be up until 1:30. Because of this, I'm missing a whole day of work. I'm going to have to work either late into tonight or this weekend. If I was going to use it as day off, this is not the day that would work - halfway through the day on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, this endangers my job. This makes me look unreliable. If I'm not reliable, then my job won't keep me. They'll hire someone else. If this happened once or twice a year, you know, sometimes things are understandable. But it happens monthly and I'm getting pretty fed up. I don't have a choice. There aren't a lot of high speed internet companies who service Tooele. But if you have a choice, go with a different company. Every time they can't maintain their service properly, they cost me money. It's not just an inconvenience, it's my livelihood.", "This company could give a rats ** about its loyal customers. They are rude, especially a gentlemen named Lee in Knoxville, TN. This problem has been going on for a week, with no resolution. This company if full of crap in their advertising, by saying they care about customer service. Do not choose Xfinity - they truly suck!", "I would give 0 stars if it was possible. I had XFINITY for 3 years and have unfortunately had to move 3 times as well. The number of bad experiences I've had with them is alarming. First they don't notify you when your package expires so make sure you're paying attention or you'll be paying way more than you were used to. When you try and change packages it always ends up more expensive even when you \"downgrade\" service. Their customer service is terrible - be prepared to wait forever to talk to someone over the phone. You can use their online chat and it's sometimes faster. When you finally get someone their English won't be good, they won't understand what you're saying, and they'll have to transfer you 5 times. I signed up for a new package the last time I moved and found out after they installed it it was a completely different package that they actually set up.\r\n\r\nThe biggest lesson I learned from using them is DO NOT under any circumstances get the security system. When my last package was up I decided to move from TV + internet to TV + internet + security. However I had some reservations about the 2 year contract and cancellation fees because I move a lot. I asked the rep to give me the details of what would happen if I needed to move again. He said not to worry because it's easy to transfer the service and they wouldn't charge me the security install fee again since I already paid it. What he left out if you move to an area outside their service area your still responsible for the service fees. I tried explaining to the rep and finally to the supervisor that I would never had added on the security if they had been completely transparent with me about the fees. \r\n\r\n1 1/2 hour and >$700 in fees later I am furious. Their supervisor basically ignored everything I said and refused to look back at the conversation I had when signing up even though he admitted they have those records. I will NEVER use them again. It's a complete waste of money and your time/sanity. Even if your other options aren't as good I would still recommend not using them. Absolutely terrible company", "I had an issue with my Comcast Xfinity internet going out. I followed the Comcast Xfinity app trouble shooting steps without success. I contacted the Comcast Xfinity technical support through the app. (The app is good - that is why they get one star.) This technical support operator also conducted trouble shooting without success. He felt the problem was with my internet box. I offered to take the unit to my local Comcast/Xfinity store. He stated that it would be better if I scheduled for a technician to come out and look for the issue. I had several issues with missed Comcast Xfinity technician appointments when I set up my service in September 2015 (my service started in November 2015 - two months later because of this) so I asked again if he was sure I shouldn't just go to the local store. He confirmed no.\r\n\r\nI agreed to setting up an appointment. At the end of the call he stated that I MAY incur some charges if the technician found the lack of service was not a Comcast Xfinity issue. The technician came on time and found that the problem was with the Comcast / Xfinity signal strength. He fixed THEIR issue and left. When paying my bill - I found I was charged $60 for a service call. I called the billing line and was told that the only thing that could be done was to offer me was a $20 credit and 3 months of a movie channel. Or she could submit a ticket to a supervisor for further review to possibly get a full refund. I asked if I could speak with a supervisor instead.\r\n\r\nI was transferred to a supervisor who proceeded to tell me the following things: 1) All service technician calls are $60, even if the issue is with the service provided by Comcast / Xfinity. 2) It is company policy that Comcast Xfinity will not issue a refund regardless that their staff did not disclose this when scheduling the appointment. 3) Escalating to a supervisor only offers Comcast Xfinity a training opportunity to maybe correct false statements for future subscribers.\r\n\r\nComcast Xfinity staff (knowingly or unknowingly) are scheduling service calls under the pretense that you MAY be charged, not that you WILL be charged. I was told by the supervisor that Comcast Xfinity has set the following as corporate policies that are non-negotiable. 1) Regardless of the issue - if a service call is issued for your location - even if the service issue is that of Comcast Xfinity - the customer pays $60. In other words - you are paying for their staff (or contractor) to fix their error. 2) Even if their staff did not make you aware of the charges upfront - they will not issue you a credit. They will review the call and talk to the staff member. That means that they will be able to confirm that the staff member did not divulge the charges upfront and that they do not care enough to honor customer's rights or let alone just conduct a fair business practice. If these are set as \"Corporate Policies\" then this must be a frequent error.", "When we were getting ready to move, we called the Comcast number to get this going. The call went to a third party that gave us incorrect information. This lead to our service being cancelled and getting billed for breaking the 2-year contract early ($1200.00!). Setting up new service in our new home was a nightmare. After 12 hours on the phone it was finally straightened out but the customer service was terrible. Not that we expected a callback, but three reps said they would make it their job to fix the issues and would call back. Ha! What a joke. Old saying - if you expect nothing you will never be disappointed. Comcast claims to make moving easy - it was anything but easy; incorrect information, terrible customer service and many wasted hours on the phone with incompetent service reps. If you can get TV and DSL elsewhere, do it.", "Comcast/Xfinity give you credit for outages and other charges and then turn around and take their money back monthly afterwards by adding $3, $4, $5, or $6 here and there when they can't explain to you where those extra charges are coming from. They also overcharge you for package deals that are suppose to be cheaper and also will not allow you to get discounts that you are qualified for.", "How sad is it that a company takes advantage, lies, scams and does nothing to make their customers happy. They charge you for channels and things didn't want or know you had. They send you equipment that don't work and they send someone who doesn't know what they are doing to install it. They send someone to get the equipment if you late on a bill without and warning but they will say \"Oh we sent this\" or \"We sent that\". Lying scamming company. Shame on you!!!", "I have tried to find a different internet provider but cannot find one. At&t told me Comcast has ever line used in zip 30035.

Considered going off cable with Roku or Apple TV but did not see enough advantages even with the lower cost.", "They have been inconsistent since we moved here. We had to wait 6 months for service that is less than par for over 12 years. When the snowbirds come to town they seem unable to support the extra draw on their services.", "I've used Comcast for 7 years so I'm pretty satisfied though there are some issues. On installation at the outset, a contract installer was so bad that I asked that he be replaced by a \"real\" installer. He stood with arms over his chest and said that, \"Isn't how we do it\". He wouldn't connect more than 1 line into the house though the order was for two, and the second tv was on the back as far from the front entry from the pole as could possibly be measured. So it called for going around the sides of the house and he refused. Since then the installations have gone well except for the time the Comcast installer and the security installer had a face off. Keeping the cable from drooping from the pole to the house has been the problem most often recurring, the clean installation of new wire placements within the house has been next. The people are great, without exception from my experience.", "The reason for this is they have always been very slow, laggy service. I pay for the triple play and they promised a rate of 96.00 and now I pay 120.00 for service that half the time I'm waiting for it to work. Plus my cable is constantly on off like there were some bad storms when there's not. If you're going to advertise fast internet or good cable you should make sure it is what you're providing.", "The service was poor from the beginning. I called the original tech after he left, saying the internet wasn't working. He said he would be right back but never showed up. I finally called to complain but they told me I'd have to pay for a tech. The issue was that they cram everyone on the same internet WiFi channel. I told them that I wanted the channel changed, but they couldn't do that remotely, only a tech can, which I have to pay for. Two months and I pay for crappy service after I figure out the fix and pay for a tech. I would give zero stars if I could.", "IMO the price of this service is overpriced for the service provided, the length of the contract is too long, and the customer service is less than honorable in their 'customer support'. Apparently the lack of actual support is due to corporate policies according to the people I have spoken with at the company over the phone.", "They provide good service and support. Their techs are available 24/7 and are usually able to resolve the problem over the phone. I generally will take care of replacing equipment myself since it is easier for me rather than wait for a tech to come to the house.", "Comcast Xfinity has been prompt and professional.

The free upgrade with the cable remote is much appreciated!", "Comcast is a love-hate proposition for me and while they generally get whatever fixed, there might be a great amounts of patience involved. Have now found how to best resolve these issues and it certainly isn't over the phone. That's just one black hole after another.

I had only internet service at the previous location. They said when I move they treat me as new customer and give a promotion to try triple play and they said I can cancel after a month. But I realized from other rep that I cannot cancel 2 service and keep one to do that. Then I canceled 2 service after 1 day which I did not want, requested for refund. However they charged me $50 extra and they say they cannot give the whole refund. Just for 1 day I paid $50.

Three years ago I began staying in my family's apartment building to assist with maintenance and travel to school more easily. At the time I needed internet and unfortunately our only option was Comcast.

When she passed away, I was told, again that I would have to go across town to their store and bring a death certificate with me. I don't drive now, so the cab fare is really high. I don't see why a remote cannot be mailed out and why they can't correct their typo of my social security number over the phone. They also bundle services.

Originally I called to change our service to only phone and internet. The deal I found online said we could get both for $59, the representative told me that deal is only for new customers, it is not open to existing customers. This is frustrating considering we were paying customers who were completely satisfied with Comcast/Xfinity, but simply wanted to change our service. After wanting to make that change we continued to have problems with changing our service.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, each time I call, they tell me I am not on the account. While logged in on our Xfinity account online I am even a user on our account, yet each representative tells me I am not on the account. Despite being told I am not on the account, they only tell me I am not on the account when I want to make changes to the account that reduce the amount of money they will receive with us. When I called to add services, no one questioned me being on the account. When I called to cancel our account the representative told me I was not authorized, when I spoke with her supervisor, she stated that I was in fact on the account and she cancelled our service. I had to call back to put a hold on the cancellation until we could get AT&T to install and when I called back to continue our service, again the representative never questioned if I was on the account. \r\n\r\nA week later when I called back to cancel our service, the representative told me I was not on the account, I asked to speak with his supervisor, she stated that I was not on the account. I hung up. I called Xfinity back less than a minute later and talked with a separate representative and she stated I was on the account and then transferred me to the department I needed to speak with in order to cancel my account, and they again said I was not on the account. I told her the previous representative I had spoken to had verified that I was on the account she put me on hold, came back and said she was able to use existing notes from a previous call (one in which they verified I was on the account). \r\n\r\nOverall, it appears to me that either Xfinity is disorganized and some representatives are not able to see full account information (which I deem highly unlikely) or they have a lack of integrity in their business when they will lose money and claim I am not on the account when in fact I am. I would never recommend Comcast/Xfinity simply as a result of this lack of integrity or disorganization because I wasted too much time on the phone hearing I was not an authorized account holder when I was. Needless to say we have discontinued our service with Comcast/Xfinity because they seems like a poor way of doing business and we would rather give our money to a service that values integrity and truly helping paying customers first.

To the tune of over $700.00 dollars. My husband has extensively called and tried talking to them to no avail. The clincher is that the number is still in use so Comcast still has the business as my husband gave the partner the business number. BUT because his business partner had already signed her new contract we couldn't pass our contract (which we had never agreed upon extending) over to her. We are hard working people, we have always paid our bills. Now they have sent us to collections. The first time in 69 years of life my husband has ever had a smudge against his financial character.

I then found someone to assist with that. This month I was informed that my \"promotion\" was ending and it would cost me 89.99 for the same internet service. No one can convince me that it cost Comcast an additional 49.99 more to provide me with the same internet I am using now.

I live in an over 60 apartment complex and have heard similar stories from the residents. It needs to stop.

I let them know that I will have to cancel, if they do not value loyalty and return business, and the agent I talked to was silent. That is bad customer service on top of bad pricing for bad service.

There SHOULD be a class-action lawsuit against them. It has really gotten out of hand. We pay top-dollar for internet speed and get far from what the bottom range should be. We have requested the outdoor cable wire to be replaced with an RG 11 wire, as it is what should be installed, considering the length from the electric pole in our backyard to the juncture at our house. Instead we have this guy come and install just a regular satellite tv wire, essentially the one that was there beforehand. What was really irksome, was that he was the second person who was supposed to come out and repair it, but he didn't. He dropped the ball.\r\n\r\nHe lead me to believe he had installed the RG 11 but I found out that it was the same substandard wiring that was there beforehand. That is utterly dishonest. We have had serious internet problems for the last 7 months and have had TWENTY technicians come to my home during that period. Most of these guys are contracted out and I have been told they get paid for each thing they do. Unfortunately they do things that are unnecessary and unhelpful. We are at our wit's end. Comcast is unethical. It continues to expand beyond what its present infrastructure can support. We pay top dollar for tv packages and the highest of internet speed packages... Neither serve us well. Comcast, you are unethical and deplorable. Why has there not been a class-action suit against them? It's criminal.\r\n\r\nI am exasperated beyond words. If I did not have 4 teenagers who rely on the internet to work in order to do homework, I would have told CC adios ages ago. I don't understand how promises for service can be made when a repair person shows up for an appointment with no history documented for the call. Last person showed up and said \"I hear you are having trouble with your internet.\" He had no history, he saw that the call had requested two supervisors but couldn't tell me why it was him who was called and not the supervisors. While he was standing in my hallway I explained the situation and he shook his head with disbelief. I spoke to his dispatcher and explained the issue. I was told that there would be TWO supervisors on the job the following day. Nobody came and our internet is the same.\r\n\r\nI have made so many phone calls, have been promised a service on a certain day, apologies and promises of supervisors to come out... And nothing. I have spend thousands of dollars on computer/internet/AV guys in my home to get our wireless to work. They are frustrated because they cannot do their work because Comcast service is terrible all over Houston. ATT you will have the market with fiber optics if you do what's right and put the customer as a priority. Comcast you have failed...irrevocably in my book. The company must wreak with cynicism. Fiber optics from ATT is soon in my neighborhood. It will blow you out and away COMCAST.

It happens just often enough to be able to call the service unreliable. It also happens too frequently while watching online content on television such as Netflix. Imagine being in the final ten minutes of the last episode of a binge watch series and then losing service every minute for several minutes at a time for the rest of the episode. Of course, while there is no proration for service lost, timely payment is expected. As customers, we deserve better. We pay you, but you give us shoddy service. Also, their customer service is useless and they make it too difficult to talk to a human where service outages are concerned.

When we came back today Nov 11, 2017, internet was not working at all. So, I set up the new modem then called for activation around 6 pm. Waited for at least thirty mins while Agent 1 figures out how to fix my problem. Then finally she said she spoke to a fellow customer representative that they need to create a new account first. She then would call me But she never did. After an hour, I called back. According to agent 2, agent 1 never put the details of my concern nor my call back number as I specifically mentioned my call back number to her.\r\n\r\nAgent 2 was able to resolve my activation problem after another 1 hr. So thank you Comcast for wasting two hours of my life. Also, I tried Call back to talk to the manager regarding their poor service. Agent 3 asked why I wanted to speak with her manager so I explained what happened. She then gave me a brief hold (5secs). Agent 3 said her supervisor was busy due to the number of complaints from error emails. Is this true? Or does she not want me to talk to her boss? Btw, I was told that my internet had blast to 200 mbps. Truth is it is usually 10-30 mbps and lowest was 0.55 mbps. Called them up several times throughout the year but they told me it\u2019s not really 200 mbps but unable to explain the less than 10 mbps. I ended up not calling for my own sanity.

(Very disruptive.)\r\n\r\nComcast representatives convinced me to pay for upgraded service to improve the situation, this seemed to improve performance for a while, but soon deteriorated to very spotty inconsistent service. Every time we complained we would be told that our usage was likely excessive, or that our equipment was causing problems, they insisted that all Comcast equipment and services were performing perfectly. My most recent complaint in November 2017 resulted in a visit from a Comcast technician who was involved in a new cable being run into our neighborhood, he said that the existing circuit was totally overloaded, and had been for months. Subsequently I was billed $99.00 for a service visit. This seems wrong yet no one that I contact by phone will help remove this charge.", "Just wanted to thank you people for screwing me over. I'm not even an Xfinity customer and you screwed me. Your installer was messing around with my neighbors cable and got him all set up but due to the complete incompetence of your employee, my cable is now gone. No cable, no internet, no phone. I work from home so this will cost me a lot of money. My neighbor called your company to get the installer back out to do the job the right way which would include not taking my service down that I pay for and they basically said that as long as HE had service and the fact that MY service no longer works is MY problem and that I'd have to call MY provider (which is NOT you for reasons JUST like this). \r\n\r\nMY provider won't be able to make it until Friday. Now keep in mind. I did nothing here. I was cut off from my service by YOUR company. Now I have to cease my operations until Friday because YOU people will not come and repair what YOU ruined. I stopped using your service because the service was bad and just when I considered going back to you, this happens. I will be going out of my way to give your crap company the worst reviews I can (all truthful of course). The blatant disregard your company has shown me is inexcusable.

I asked for the 50 mbps plan while they had given me the 25 mbps instead which is much slower. I canceled my service within the 30 days and went with another provider.

The Internet is down until 1 or 2 pm. Then it will work until about 10 or 11 pm and cut out again. The problem is the internet. X1 relies on it. The cable TV signal will lock on one channel and not let you change it but it will work. Now the only common thing is that it happens at night and it is working fine when the Tech gets here.

I've had Comcast/Xfinity service since 1973. There have been issues over the years that I've called to complain about that were eventually worked out but the past few years their service has deteriorated.

The sad thing about it is I was willing to accept POOR SERVICE even though I threatened to take my business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAn issue arose last month that I had to take precious time out of my schedule to call in, wade through the prompts on the automated system, hold forever, be passed three times to another person before the issue was finally resolved. I was told they'd put notes in the system so I wouldn't have to call about it anymore. Well, the same issue came up again this month & when I called, guess what??? I had to rehash the issue again & there were NO NOTES posted from last month's call. When I asked for a supervisor my issue still wasn't resolved. I'd threatened on several occasions to take my business to AT&T where, as a 30 year retiree, I get a discount of 50%.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I never followed through because I'd have to learn something new, so I stayed with what was familiar. Well, yesterday I'd had all the expensive poor service a paying customer could take & instead of just blowing smoke, I took my business elsewhere. AT&T, unlike Comcast, doesn't bill you a month ahead. Yes, I'll have to learn their system but I'm getting a $100.00 Visa gift card as a new customer reward. My Comcast bill rose every other month but my new bill for the next 2 years will be an amount half of what I've been paying, an amount I can afford.

She can't help on that. I need to call customer support to get the other account canceled and then she will help. \r\n\r\nDid I requested any call?

The rep had trouble with the March 3 date; put it in as March 1 first, then needed to change it. I requested different service at Saint John's than I currently have at Hudson. 2/7 - called to let Comcast know that my Xfinity Stream was no longer available. Got sent to tech help. About 1-hour phone call, the tech finally got Xfinity Stream to work again. 2/9 - noticed Xfinity Stream was not working again in the AM; had to go out of town, had no time for lengthy phone calls with Comcast. 2/11 - called Comcast to notify them that once again, I no longer had Xfinity Stream. Was told I had cancelled it. Had to clarify that I am moving; never did a cancellation.\r\n\r\nGot forwarded to a tech after rehashing everything like the first time I called... Another 1-hour phone call. 2nd tech stated that he had now fixed the problem 100% for sure; since I was calling from work and not home, I could not verify, but he assured me that I would have Xfinity Stream when I got home. 2/11 - got home and did not have Xfinity Stream as I had been assured I would. Called Comcast, told agent my problem, she said I had cancelled my current service; once again; I had to explain whole thing over again, as I had never cancelled service. Bounced me to a tech, who tried to do all the same things the tech in the AM had tried, and he failed, so finally decided to \u201cescalate\u201d me even though I had already requested escalation (he would not) - so, after 40 minutes on the phone, he escalated me. The \u201cescalation tech\u201d tried for another 40 minutes to get my current Xfinity Stream service to work. \r\n\r\nShe cancelled my new order for cable/internet installation at Saint John's on March 3, thinking if the new order was cancelled, I could get my current service back. The current service was not restored after the cancellation. She transferred me to another tech who informed me that the package I had - the Xfinity Stream - was no longer available. They then transferred me to billing, since I had been paying for service I was not getting, and now it was no longer available after Comcast erroneously cancelled it, but when I told billing what was happening, they didn\u2019t want to deal with this either or perhaps deal with how to refund me for the service I was paying for and not receiving. \r\n\r\nBilling told me to call Customer Solution Dept in the morning to get help, as the guy I was talking to assured me that I COULD still get the Xfinity Stream service that I had prior to when Comcast cancelled it on me, despite what the last tech I had talked to had told me. Received text message from Comcast cancelling my set up on March 3 at Saint John's. 2/12 - called Customer Solution Dept at the special number (!) and got the recording, which took forever to get through; I did not get personal help; had to do the whole account authentication thing again with a robot. Turned out the number was for tech repair, not customer solutions. Got transferred to Customer Solutions. Got an agent who confirmed that, yes, the Stream service I previously had and that Comcast erroneously cancelled on me is now no longer available! \r\n\r\nSo, the dude last night in billing who punted me back to \u201cCustomer Solutions\u201d was wrong.

I relocated to Illinois. I called Xfinity Comcast to transfer my service to my new address. The lady on the phone was very helpful in setting everything up and everything was going good until I received a call from a collection agency saying I owed Comcast over $600!!! Apparently, they opened up an entirely new account at the new address and never closed my old account and didn't even get a hold of me about it this entire time. I found out from the collection agency! I called Comcast to find out what happened and they said the mistake happened because they spelled my name wrong on the new account (despite having the same social security number) and they would get back to me.\r\n\r\nA few weeks passed and I hadn't heard back, so I called again. Same story, it was their fault they spelled my name wrong and that's why the old account was never closed, they will resolve the issue and to only make payments on the new account like I have been. Two months later I see the collection agency is still listed on my credit score from Comcast. I called again! This time they tell me they have no record of me ever speaking with a representative from Comcast and there are no notes on my account. They also tell me there is nothing they can do because it's past 120 days of non payment even though I didn't know about it because I MOVED and when I did find out about it they kept giving me the runaround. They also have the nerve to tell me they don't transfer services between states!!! WHAT!? Well your employees never told me this when I requested a transfer of services! \r\n\r\nTHEN they have the nerve to tell me because my parents were still living there and using the services I had to pay the balance. So if it were strangers using the services in my name, I would have to pay for them as well!!? By the end of the conversation with a supervisor from Comcast named Kim, she literally told me it's somewhat their fault this happened and it's also my fault and to ask my parents (whom I don't talk to by the way) if they will pay the collection agency! This company has no ethics, they don't admit when they are in the wrong, and blame their consumer. This whole thing has been a nightmare and I will never recommend Comcast ever!

Service is slow, we live in an urban area, signal should be strong but it constantly drops. Executive offices say that we will get the blast speed (up to 300 Mbps) if we are HARDWIRED. This does not apply to wifi. Just being down the hall from the modem and getting a speed test of 140 Mbps is fine according to them. This isn't what they advertise. The visuals is of a family of 4+, all on their devices, playing, having fun, and all at super fast speeds. Such a gross misrepresentations. Our home was serviced on more than 10 occasions all for the same problem. Whatever fix was performed, was undone the following visit with comments about the previous installer's skill level. \r\n\r\nFaulty equipment was installed (or unstable equipment with well known problems was installed) and the following technician would say, 'Who did this? This is a sure-second-call unit.' When I asked what that meant, he said, \"One visit to install and a second visit to de-install.\" Executive offices tell us they know nothing about instability of equipment (and they would know) and I find out 6 hour later from another executive that there's a national ticket out on the modem. They are downright abusive in how they monkey around with people's time. I understand that utilities experience outages and repairs need to be made (but there was no outage with Comcast) and 10+ repairs to juggle not being at work, supervising technicians who are doing and undoing and redoing the same fixes over and over again is beyond the pale. \r\n\r\nThis company feels completely at ease airing their dirty laundry in my home, on my time, and at my expense. It's outrageous. I'm told that it's not something that should be going on however with the number of Comcast/Xfinity personnel engaging in blackballing behavior suggests that it's quite commonplace.

I have had it with Comcast!!!", "DO NOT GET XFINITY INTERNET OR ANY OTHER SERVICES. I paid for service and my internet never worked, not once. I had to pay for a service call and still it never worked. I had numerous technical calls and IM's and STILL IT NEVER WORKED. Therefore, I returned my modem and was told that I had to pay an early termination fee. I didn't pay it. Then they sent me a bill for $200.00 to pay for my monthly services and termination fee!!! I've spent over 30 hours and 20 calls on the phone with these people (being on hold, then being transferred and hung up on). The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Then finally, sometimes, I get to talk to someone who acts like they can help, and they tell me that they will credit my account $100 and put in a supervisor ticket for the other $100.\r\n\r\nAND THEN I GET ANOTHER BILL FOR $200. They are the worst! Run for your life. Yesterday, I just found out that they sent me to their in-house collections department and when I called XFINITY customer service, they said that they have no record of the numerous billing and technical calls!

I want to be credited for the service I never had!!!", "Having been warned that Comcast uses deceptive practices and makes a practice of regularly raising the prices of their service on existing customers, I specifically asked for a guarantee that my rate would be frozen if I signed up for a two year deal. I was assured by two different support people that it would be locked, however after just four months they raised my rate. It was only a few bucks, but I have no doubt that another increase will follow... and another. It's what they do. I contacted them to protest but they refused to honor the deal.

I enrolled in service in July of 2017 and was guaranteed a $50 gift card for enrolling. I am now writing this review in January 2018 and have never received the gift card. I have contacted Comcast via the web three times and have called twice. Every time a representative says that the situation is being handled and that, \"a gift card was sent out in September.\" \r\n\r\nThis is not about the money on the gift card, but more about the principle behind using these baiting tactics to get people to enroll. It's absolutely unacceptable that something like this could occur. Unfortunately, I am stuck with Comcast as they are the only provider in my area. We should be getting access to another provider within the next six months and I will happily switch providers when alternative service becomes available. The whole thing is shameful on their part.", "My family went over on internet usage in Christmas month December overage charges of 160.00 and they won't help us with billing.

Andrew in customer service was no help at all!", "If you can get around using Comcast/Xfinity it would definitely be in your best interest! Having used home and business services for cable and internet, my experience has been reasonably AWFUL to say the least. Scenario 1) The internet or cable goes out and you troubleshoot the symptoms as they instruct you to with no help so they say that they will assign a technician to you and there will be a phone call to set up an appointment for your service. That phone call never happens and you are left with no service, still.\r\n\r\nScenario 2) Upon setting up a new business, we sign an agreement with Comcast/Xfinity TEN MONTHS before opening and clearly illustrate all of the job that needs to be performed, only to see the job completed over THREE MONTHS past our grand opening. I have never seen a cable and internet installation take so many meetings to \"discuss the plan\" and nothing ever happen! How does it take 13 months to complete an installation?? Santa Fe, TX may be a slow moving town, but they sure let us know about it when they did not get what they expected!\r\n\r\nScenario 3) With a home account, somehow our monthly rates go up EVERY SINGLE MONTH!! We call in and complain and the representative \"puts notes into the software\" and \"guarantees that nothing like this will happen again\" only to turn around and spend another hour on the phone going through the same thing, 30 days later.

Going up at various sellers. Some wanted 200 and that didn't include first month of service. Service was great then at about the 25th day the Amazon firestick would not hold the signal. Troubleshooted nothing worked. Tried a laptop nothing worked until attaching Ethernet cord. So finally tried game console and Smart TV. Nothing would hold the WiFi signal. After 2 days of forced troubleshooting with Comcast over and over they send a tech. All he did was check to see if signal was coming to the box and said it's nothing he can do. (Side note I never have more than 2 devices feeding off the signal at the same time.)\r\n\r\nI call Comcast again. They want to keep troubleshooting anything to keep from replacing the equipment. I ask for a supervisor. He tells me to contact ALL of the manufacturers and ask to reset the IP addresses...

On hold for 30 minutes. Rep comes back saying that they're so backed up they can't set an appointment but someone will call back to confirm. That was Thursday evening around 750 pm. Today is Saturday 216 am. A total time of 5 hours plus waiting for the pointless tech Thursday for 2 hours. This equipment must be a hand me down. I'm going to attempt to call again tomorrow morning.

Decided to go with just internet and was told 29.00 a month. Returned the boxes and price changed to over 100.00.

Xfinity wants you to get a bigger package, faster speed and you will not get THAT speed neither. It will be a little faster but not what you are paying for. I worked with Xfinity over the phone for 1.5 hours (OMG), and after working on it and the tec. could get it to the 50MB. It stayed around 23, 26. I lowered the 100 MB package I had before to the 50MB because all I was getting is 45ish. So why not save money. I was told we will have a tec. come to the house and never heard from one.

They sent out a technician 3 days after the service stopped working which I fully understand. However, once the tech arrived he checked everything inside and out and came to the conclusion that the Modem was the problem! He then went on to tell me that they (Xfinity) uses poor quality/defected modems for their customers! He suggested that I purchase my own modem and router, if I ever wanted my internet to work flawlessly. I couldn't believe it! I knew my service was slow but I didn't think it was being done on purpose!\r\n\r\nI call Xfinity prepaid back and was told that they would mail out another modem and that it should arrive in 3-5 business days, then after three days of waiting I called back and was told that it could take as long as 5-7 business days! By this time I was fed up and so I went shopping for my own modem. I shopped around and then after identifying two possible brands I asked my son (he's a techie) which he thought was better. He gave me his opinion and asked me to call them again and make sure it was ok to purchase my own modem with prepaid. I called back and was told that I could purchase my own modem and that the one which they shipped out could be given to a friend or whatever, I didn't need to return it. \r\n\r\nI called my son and told him what they said and to go ahead and make the purchase (~$200). Once he came back to the house to set it up for me (we were all so excited) and all the cords were connected and ready to go, I called Xfinity prepaid back and the agent said I couldn't use my own modem with Xfinity prepaid!!! I was so upset, I asked for a manager... the agent hung up on me!!! I called back and another agent said the same thing and I asked for a manager/supervisor or someone to explain to me why I was told to make the purchase and then told it's not \"recommended\". \r\n\r\nWe went back and forth with them for days... until another refurbished modem arrived in the mail. Then when we plugged that one in, they didn't want to give me back the credits they promised for my troubles!!! I had to wait on hold today for about a total of 2 hours to get them to activate my service and give me the credits promised! We'll see if they come up with some more BS before the credits expire.", "I called to Comcast to add my husband's name on account. It was okay, took representative about couple of seconds to do it, and then he was very pushy with all product and all services. I believe every time on his offer I was explaining nicely why I don't need it, and he keep pushing it. After finally I got off the phone. In a little while I got lost internet connection, I believe he did something because I have had great connection for more than one year, so I needed to call them again. They fixed it but I didn't even need to restart my modem, after that I have great internet again, but I'm very dissatisfied with the experience.", "The CEO of Comcast made 40 million with stock options. I signed a 2 year contract and it went up after a year anyway. They really don't care if you call to complain or not. Did no good. Seems they have you trapped.

What a rip!!!", "Lied about Fees & Horrible Customer Service - I signed up for their internet service on the 14th of December with the advertisement that offered FREE installation; I even read the small print. The day before the install guy came they sent me a bill for $60 and took $50 out of my account to \"hold on to\". I ended talking to some Indian guy, that could barely speak English, and argued over the install fees. I am not wasting my time justifying myself for an hour with customer service. Anyway, I ended up canceling and had to call multiple times, each time given a longer time period, to get my $50 back.

Customer service can confirm that it should have been sent, but every call eventually leads to being transferred to a mysterious Gift Card Redemption line that has had a 10 minute hold time for months and prompts you to hold (nicely) before hanging up on you. The whole process is a mess and it's astonishing that these things aren't monitored.

I work from home, so when I moved my internet was very important for that specific reason, prior to moving I called Xfinity to let them know and I was told by an agent that all I needed to do was plug in my router and I should be good to go and they would transfer my services when I was actively in the home. When I moved I called Xfinity and let them know, they transferred my services but my internet still wasn't online. I called back and got another agent that stated that my modem wasn't online, she then asked did I have a coax cord plugged into my router. I then explained to the women that the last agent I spoke with didn't tell me I needed one and I asked her multiple times did I need to bring the coax cord from my home and was it needed. \r\n\r\nAfter I got past that, I learned that I needed an adapter plate for the coax cord to go into but my apartment didn't supply one, a technical support agent had me on the phone for about 45 minutes trying to send signals to a router that wasn't even online, she then told me she would send an electrician but after 40 minutes of being on the phone and her procrastinating about getting me a signal or a technician if the signal didn't go through the phone hung up. I then called back got another agent he stated, \"Hey, you don't need a wall plate to plug the adapter in, all you have to do is get the coax cord from our service center, plug one end into the router and the other end into a television with a splitter\", I went out purchased a splitter and a television because I didn't have one yet, tried hooking it up but I didn't understand. \r\n\r\nI then called back and got another agent who stated, \"Okay you cannot do that without having the coax cord from the lines outside and without you receiving a cable connection\", at this point I was frustrated because I've been getting the runaround, no one offered a technician just terrible advice. After I got frustrated, I asked for a supervisor. I explained to the supervisor that I needed a technician because different agents are telling me different things and it's pissing me off, I explained that I didn't have an adapter plate for the coax cord, it's impossible for me to locate it outside and because the last agent told me she will get me a technician and hung up which was 5 days ago they needed to get one out soon to me because one was never sent as possible, they tried to give me far dates so the supervisor stated that he would get me over to a tech agent because they would be able to get one sooner. \r\n\r\nI spoke with the tech agent who then stated that he will get me an installer out on a Thursday between 8-9 am in March 8th 2018, on the day the technician was promised, one never showed up. I called and the agent stated that they did not show any appointments for me, I asked for a supervisor but then the agent started to investigate, she apologized and had me on hold, the agent then came back and stated that she could get me a technician out that same day between 1 and 3 pm. Around 1-3pm I called because no technician came and I've been watching out my window for a Comcast truck all day, I also called my job and let them know that I would be working that day because the technician as promised by Xfinity will be out there, I just let them know I would be late, at this point my job had to use my vacation time because I kept missing out! \r\n\r\nI also gained points because I could not work and at some point there was a storm so I had no other options! The technician stated that he's been calling and he marked my case as not home, long story short I never got a technician, Xfinity gave me the runaround. I spoke with multiple supervisors who cut me off was very rude and careless, I lost pay from work, got points added and Comcast did not care, they made up lies, blames me for everything that happened, never once sent a technician until I had to explode then when I said they would credit me for the time missed and gave me a $3 Credit! Xfinity is the worse! Their customer service from the agents to the supervisors! I will be emailing the CEO.", "I spent at least 2 hrs on the phone with various people, but found out that you cannot downgrade your service with Comcast. If you want to get rid of services that you do not use, you must cancel all services for 90 days... then you can initiate new services at lower level. How crazy is this??? Unfortunately, many have few internet choices, and with Comcast, we are required to bundle them with other products (+taxes, fees, etc) to get reasonable internet deals. Right now, I am paying $223/mo for internet/tv/phone bundle. I rarely use the TV... never use the phone, but pay lots of fees/taxes based on this. There is an option for internet, plus 10 basic channels for $54.99... but I cannot choose this, because I have been a loyal Comcast customer for many years. You are not allowed to downgrade your services. Seriously??? We seriously need more players in this market. It is a scam.", "So I had just bought Comcast 2 days ago. And not even 1 day in and they had started to throttle my internet meaning I do not get the amount of upload and download speeds that I pay for. They do this at certain times of the day. Plus they had told us that the most we should be getting is 50 down and 10 up. We barely get 5 up and 25 down. All I'm saying is anyone looking for a good, trustworthy internet provider then Comcast is not for you. They are deceiving and they are also a bunch of rip-offs. Please second guess when you think about Comcast as your provider.", "I have had cable service for more than 25 years. I had DSL for my internet, until Comcast brought out cable internet in our area. It worked fine for several years, then, they introduced the X1 TV system, once that was installed, my internet went to hell. I have replaced modems and cable boxes, had techs to the house, all of which stay for about 1/2 an hour, see everything is working and hit the road. Then within 12 hours, the same problems start. I love how they have YOU LOCK INTO a contract, but where the hell is their end of the bargain! Told them tonight I am done. I am not paying another red cent! Tired of being put in the back burner, maybe when they do not get payment, they will pay attention!", "I received my internet modem, and had no problem connecting all the cables. After 20 minutes, and no online light, I went outside the house and discovered that the cable wasn\u2019t even connected to the box on the telephone pole. I called for a technician to come out, and they scheduled me for a 7:30 am appointment on a Saturday, which was 4 days out (seems a bit early in the morning but I digress). Saturday arrived and so did the technician. He was driving a small Ford Panel van with a little 15 foot ladder strapped to the top. He got out, took a look at the telephone pole, then told me he couldn\u2019t do it because he would need a bucket truck and none of them were available.\r\n\r\nAfter he left I called customer support again and they sent out a supervisor. When he arrived he told me their bucket truck operator was on vacation and would be until Thursday. He told me he\u2019d go back to the shop and see if they could possibly come out Sunday instead if they could get the keys to the truck. He promised to call me within 30 minutes and left. He never called.\r\n\r\nSunday rolled around and I contacted customer support again, and they booked me an appointment for Monday. I specifically told them to bring a bucket truck and screenshotted the conversation (this was done via their IM service, not a phone call). It\u2019s now Sunday afternoon and I\u2019m crossing my fingers that they actually get it connected tomorrow. PS After the first technician left on Saturday, Comcast credited $20 to my account for the inconvenience.", "This outfit just sucks! Over the course of three months they raised my basic internet charge from $30.00 per month to $59.99 per month. They told me I could no longer have internet without a basic package including TV channels. I don't want TV channels and I don't want to have to pay for TV channels. I went in and canceled my account and went to AT&T. Shove it where the sun doesn't shine Comcast/Infinity.", "Their tech came to fix a reception problem. I owned my modem, but he thought it was the problem and switched his in. It wasn't the problem, but he took my modem and told me I wouldn't be charged for the modem. Now they are charging me and refuse to fix the problem or bring my modem back.", "After I canceled my internet service Comcast did not stop my service for 2 more months before I realized it was still on. Comcast kept billing me at a increased rate plus fees. After I paid the bogus bills after lengthy arguments they... Did a hard credit check on my social security for the second time in a year and did not ask my permission. Tried to sign me up without telling me they were doing a credit check PLUS nailing me in a 24 month contract. Maximum throttling down of internet speeds.\r\n\r\nI turned on my service for 2 months (no contract) at the starter rate before we moved. They canceled my service prior to the end of my billing period (today) and AGAIN tried to nail me in a 12 month contract in order to turn it on for the last 2 weeks of my billing period. I said no, I couldn't believe it. I talked to customer service immediately. They promised me my refund will be on next invoice.\r\n\r\nMy nightmare experience with Comcast is extensive. Customer service is a joke. Online support is farmed to India and some have English language skills. Does anyone feel that $79.95 per month (or $100 a month if your off auto pay and auto billing) or almost $1,000 a year seem fair for just internet access? The starter package for $34.95 is a joke (no contract) but they nail you for on fees and speeds are worse than Afghanistan's (guess). Comcast charges you if you don't sign up for paperless billing and auto pay (they want your juicy credit card or bank account numbers - they will charge you extra no matter what guaranteed) and penalizes you for not giving permission to 12 or 24 month contacts. It's ridiculous.\r\n\r\nComcast has no competition in Fort Myers, Florida nor in any other major markets. Comcast tries to bundle in media content (TV) with internet. Comcast penalizes internet only customers. It's a national joke. Cord cutters like me and millions of other users know that the days of traditional media is over. For example, if you do say... watch NBC and watch it on Comcast service it's broadcast at 480p or lower (unless you upgrade their service) while all you have to do is use rabbit ears and get it for free at 1080p on your antenna.\r\n\r\nMy advice to anyone needing internet service is to avoid Comcast altogether. If you simply need to check emails and do a little web surfing, please use mobile services like T-Mobile or MINT/SIM and use your cell phone as a hotspot. If you must use Comcast do NOT give them your social security number nor your driver's license number. They will use it to their advantage and try and nail you the first chance they get.\r\n\r\nComcast is widely regarded as the most hated company in America. Just Google it. People would rather deal with the Federal Government than Comcast. As for me I would rather get shot out of a cannon into a volcano before I use decrepit draconian Comcast I mean Spamcast I mean Brokecast. I have transcripts of all my communiques with Comcast, bills, online support, refunds and emails to support all of my information. I hope this review helps anyone in the same boat as I was or is doing their own research into this joke of a company. The negative reports about Comcast and multiple lawsuits is so widespread I am dismayed they are allowed to operate. Only cure for this company is a massive increase in competition.", "When trying to verify why I had an extra $10 charge on my account, I get through to 2 different representatives that tell me I have to take the modem I OWN down to their office to verify that it is my personal modem and not renting from Comcast. I have owned my own modem for over 3 years, ever since I started with this horrible (but only option in town) cable service. Now after 3 year, they decide to charge me for my own modem and instead of verifying the device remotely (Yes, they can do that) they want me to take time off work to come down their office to prove them wrong. I of course refuse and have them take the charges off once I speak to a tech who can verify my modem type and verify that Comcast doesn't own that type of modem.\r\n\r\nThe worst part is that I ask for a simple written verification that the charges will be removed. Comcast representatives say they can't send an email to confirm the changes have been made. The largest internet company on the west coast can't send an email. Unbelievable. They can verify my account remotely, they can send me a bill by email, but they can't send a verification that the changes will be made to my account by email. Months go by and, of course, the charges remain and I have to call back. I get a reference #, but they can't send even this number by email. I am on the third attempt to get verification that the charges have been removed to no avail.", "Waiting nine days to have a service person come out. I am bundled so no tv, internet or landline. Guy came yesterday and said he didn\u2019t have the right cable and it would be fixed today. Came home from work, still not fixed. I called and they told me 72 hours for a service call. I am cancelling tomorrow. Unacceptable on so many levels.", "Since a year we pay for extra speed 200mbps, because at 100 Mbps we only got 50 Mbps. Only for two months out of one whole year we got 200 Mbps, and that after I became really serious with Comcast Xfinity. Now we are down to 60-70 Mbps again, and the same thing all over. They try everything to blame me as a customer. I bought the latest and best modem especially fitted for Comcast. The best router. Unplugged and rebooted at their request over and over. It's time for a serious lawsuit against Comcast. We pay for something we don't get!", "I recently moved and was forced to get rid of Verizon since Comcast has monopolized many parts of the Philadelphia area. I have to get off the WiFi (100 mbs) to send picture or video messages because 99% of he time I get to send an 8 second video, I get a \u201cmessage failed\u201d error 13 minutes later. It takes 6 minutes to send a picture message, and once off of the WiFi, using my Verizon cell phone data, it takes 6 seconds. This is absolutely unacceptable! You force me to have to this ** service and cannot deliver 100% satisfaction. I don\u2019t even have multiple devices connected to the WiFi. I might as well be paying for the lowest speed internet since my sends seem to fail anyway. Look at my screenshot. Trying to send a 12 second video since 9:08 pm. I get off the WiFi after getting the message failed to send error, and it finally sends at 9:34.", "Moving into a new place and wanting to get internet service, I searched the area and noted Comcast was the most prevalent in my area. So I contacted them and was told by a representative named Steve about a deal for $59.99 that included TV with HBO and Blast Internet Service with free installation. Excited about the deal, I agreed. However, the email sent to me stated $64.99. Steve reassured me that I would be getting the $59.99 deal and that my account would be adjusted accordingly. So the installation technician comes out and, as he's performing the installation, I ask him about the deal and he confirms the information he has is for the $59.99 deal. However, when I get my first bill, it is for $64.99 and I was charged an installation fee of $59.99.\r\n\r\nFirst, I contact Comcast via Online Chat. The rep states that there is no deal for $59.99 and he has no documentation of my conversations with Steve, the original rep. Nonetheless, he said he will resolve the situation. Shortly after, I get an email stating I'll receive a credit on my account for the installation fee, but no word on fixing my bundle price. So I contact Comcast again. The rep tells me a supervisor said the deal I was referring to had expired. I exclaim that this was the deal I was offered and that I accepted. After being placed on hold she then says she did find the information regarding my deal and confirms not only that I'd be receiving the credit for the installation charge, but that $5 would also be correct for being provided the incorrect bundle.\r\n\r\nHowever, upon receiving my bill, I was being charged the same price of $64.99 and there was no deduction for the $5 difference in bundle price. They did credit me for the installation charge. So I call again, but am told the deal I am referring to had expired. I again explain my situation. Nothing gets resolved. I call again and speak to a rep named Dave. While he was very sympathetic and understanding, he exclaims I had agreed via email to the $64.99 deal. I acknowledge this but exclaim I was told by the rep I would be getting the $59.99 deal and that he would have it adjusted. \r\n\r\nHe then says, after lengthy conversation stating his understanding of how I feel I was misled by Comcast, he is going to elevate the issue two supervisory levels (that is to his supervisor and his supervisor's boss), and he confirmed a date and time when I would be contacted regarding possible resolution, AND went over word-for-word the email he was going to send. Also note that he found NO evidence of my initial conversations with Steve, the original rep who offered me the deal although he knew who he was and which office he worked out of, nor any evidence in my conversation with the second rep who confirmed the information and said I would also get the $5 deduction. However, when that time came and passed with no call, I immediately called Comcast again. \r\n\r\nWhen I exclaimed to the rep I was supposed to be contacted by Comcast, he was bewildered and said Comcast does not set appointments to contact customers, and he said there was no evidence or record of Dave, the last rep stating he would elevate the matter two levels and have Comcast get back to me on a resolution. At this point I myself am bewildered not to mention livid. The rep then exclaims that I agreed via email to the $64.99 deal and that the $59.99 deal never existed. After going back and forth, I ask if he could have it elevated to see if they could even just pay me $60 ($5 x 12 months) so I at least get one year's compensation. He said Comcast does not do that especially given I agreed via email to the $64.99 contract. He said I could apply for a different deal and a different price. After I told him I don't even watch TV and would prefer internet only, he still tried to offer me deals with elevated TV service at a higher price.\r\n\r\nWhile our overall discussion was good and civil, I told him that because Comcast would not be able to resolve the situation, I would have to consider canceling my service. I have to say I don't think I have ever come across a company with such piss-poor documentation on call correspondence. What I am also upset about is all the time I spent trying to resolve the situation. While I acknowledge that, in hindsight, I should never have agreed to the other deal via email, I was under the impression from the original rep that he would make the adjustment as he promised (plus I was anxious to get internet service and wanted to push the process along) and I trusted his word as well as Comcast as a company to make right. Finally, while I realize it's $5 a month I was fighting over, this still adds up over time and, I joined because of the $59.99 deal and that is the deal I expected to receive.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Comcast is one of very few TV and internet providers in my area. Nonetheless, my experience, has encouraged me to shop around and perhaps even consider Verizon DSL because, at the end of the day, I do not want to give my business to a company that misleads me, that doesn't have an effective documentation process, and that is unwilling to right a wrong and accommodate a dissatisfied customer.", "On December 14, 2017, I called Comcast to ask them to disconnect service starting from December 19th at my address in Indiana as I was moving to California for professional reasons. I paid off the account and asked the customer representative to close it, which he told me will be done on December 19th. He took my new address with a new order for it. When I came to Monterey, California, they gave me a new package, which I have been using and paying for. Three months later, I realized they did not close my former account and kept charging me for a non existing service. I called them as soon as I realized and the 3rd rude unprofessional customer representative I talked to said he fixed this.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the amount they are charging more than doubled instead of going zero. And the worst of it is that they just sent me an email which claimed a completely different and higher amount than what they are claiming on their website, and merged the fictitious service at the address I moved from with the current one. The more frustrating side of the issue is that they kill my time over the phone (It is sooo hard to finally get a human being to talk to. They have those stupid time wasting machines that fool you around) and they end up never solving the problem. Please avoid Comcast as much as you can. I really hate to be treated like this as a responsible customer.", "Comcast agreed to install cable at my place, having records that it had been installed there before. The first tech couldn't find the wire so sent out another tech *two weeks later* to install one. The second tech looked for the existing wire for *three hours* before saying he couldn't install a new one without permission from the HOA (why couldn't they have said that in the first place?). The HOA refused an admission letter without a letter from Comcast saying they'd provide a discreet install. I spent another *two weeks* on the phone back and forth with Comcast about providing details of the install before they finally refused to install there at all because they don't like HOAs. Note to everyone with an HOA: COMCAST told me THEY WILL NOT INSTALL AT RESIDENCES WITH HOAs ANYMORE because THEY DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM! So everyone with an HOA will now have to pay 3X as much for slower AT&T internet or elsewhere.", "I have scheduled 3 times for Xfinity to come, waited all day and they call me saying they can't come and make another appointment. It has been miserable. I have had no TV for 2 weeks. It has been really frustrated to deal with them. They are keep telling me they are coming but never show. If you are moving or just moved be prepared with Xfinity. They are horrible company. Not reliable at all.", "10 months ago, I agreed to a 24 month commitment with Comcast with a guarantee that my costs would not increase during the 24 month commitment. In less than 2 months, my charges increased by $2+/month. 2 months later, another $3+/month. Now, 10 months later Comcast has increased my charges to an additional $9 per month. Comcast response... \"nothing we can do about it\". Loathe this company.", "Made a mistake to purchase a plan from a visiting rep in a store. All looked good on paper (on his pad), until it was installed. Internet is coming at 1/3 of the promised speed. When I called the customer service they said they did not have a plan/promotion that the rep gave me. Cancelled right away. Stay away from the company, they will lie in your face.", "FYI - Comcast has ZERO commitment to customer service. Here is a letter I sent to their entire C Suite, and not a single response. \u201cI need to inform you of the worst customer service I have EVER received. Your company\u2019s reputation for poor service is well deserved, and it is actually worse than your reputation. I have been \u201cfighting\u201d with your company for over a year because of poor Internet service and it all came to a head after Hurricane Irma came through. Each time I would call to complain about the service, your company would insist on sending another \u201crent-a-stooge\u201d technician to my house. They would say, \u201cNothing is wrong, but let me rewire your house just in case\u201d \u2013 FYI, this happened FIVE times. Every time I would call, I would tell your agent this, and I would get, \u201csorry it is protocol to send a technician to your home first.\u201d Sounds like your company does not trust any technician who has come to my house. \r\n\r\n\"As mentioned, the tech would conclude the problem was not in the house but somewhere in the lines and would always say something like: \u201cI will inform the company to work on your line.\u201d A week or two would go by, nothing done, and I would call in again; REPEATING the process all over again. Still of course nothing being fixed. I can show you email after email to your office of Tom K. complaining about this (I will discuss how awful they are later in this letter). Finally, after the hurricane, I reached Lori in Tom K.\u2019s office and actually spoke with her on the phone. She assured me (a lie as it turns out) that she would follow-up on the issue and assured me that I would be able to deal with a senior manager in Florida because no one below that level ever helps. Once again, I can show email after email substantiating this. \r\n\r\n\u201cLori did (after a week) have Raymond ** (Manager, Executive Customer Care Florida Region) contact me. (FYI \u2013 after reaching out to Lori numerous times after this, NEVER A SINGLE RESPONSE). During the call with Raymond, I emphasized how many techs have been to my house, and he once again (not being able to think on his own) said it was protocol and nothing would be done to help me if I did not let a technician into my house (AGAIN!!!!). Of course, he sent a rent-a-stooge contractor that actually connected his phone to my WiFi tower and declared everything was good because he was able to connect \u2013 forgetting the fact that his WiFi icon on his phone was showing he had no access to the Internet. When I pointed this out to him, he was stumped, he started wandering around on the street outside and called his supervisor. They concluded the house needed a new drop line (although a new one had been installed less than a week prior). \r\n\r\n\"I immediately called Raymond about this, left him the first of TEN voicemails that went unreturned. This was 9/28/17. The following day, a supervisor named Garry ** reached out to me and came to my home on 9/30/17 and changed out the booster. Once again, problem NOT solved. Garry at least continued to respond to me when I reached out to him since he was kind enough to give me his cell phone. I continued to document (via picture) every time my Internet went down. I then got a telephone call from a Sean (another supervisor) wanting to follow protocol and come to the house. I flat out said \u201cNO.\u201d I told him Garry had been here and he should speak with Garry. He said he would call Garry and get back to me. The next thing I know I finally hear from Raymond (via a letter) telling me they are closing my complaint because I denied Sean the right to come into my house. \r\n\r\n\"Sean never got back to me after speaking with Garry. Raymond NEVER bothered to pick up the phone and talk to me about it, he simply sent me a letter. I immediately called Raymond and you guessed it, he never returned my call. Sean ultimately came into the house and concluded the same thing every other tech had concluded; the problem was NOT in my house. I guess your company needs to fire a great number of technicians because you obviously do not trust their work, or you would not require EVERY complaint to start in the customer\u2019s home when a technician has already said the problem is not there. I finally started communicating with Richard **, a technician manager. \r\n\r\n\"He also gave me his cell phone and continued to inform me that yes there was a problem in the system and that they were working on it. This still took days to repair. Finally, on 10/28/2017 (a full month after my one conversation with Raymond), the techs repaired the system at some remote location. It has taken over a year for my service to be anything close to reliable. Richard and to a lesser degree Garry were the ONLY employees of your organization that showed any concern for the customer. Raymond is absolutely worthless, when he did bother to call, he left me a voicemail telling me basically to stop calling him and to communicate with Richard.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow to the office of Tom K. Numerous times I reached out to that office and complained about the service I was getting from the local office here in Florida, the only response I continued to get was \u201cit is protocol that your complaint has to be handled by that office.\u201d In other words, the office of Tom K. is useless, all they do is gather complaints and farm them out, they do not handle them. I literally used the analogy of them sending the abused spouse back to the abuser, and they did not care. \r\n\r\nYou have an executive office of customer care that cannot think past the most basic protocol of \u201cforward the complaint\u201d and then wash your hands off the customer. I actually sent an email to your Investor Relations site including a copy/paste of the way I was treated by Hector within Tom K.\u2019s office, within a matter of an hour or so, I got an email from Hector. My email complaint was forwarded to him (once again back to the abuser I went). Here is the reply I got, once again he has basically said he has washed his hands off the issue and it is not his problem that no one in South Florida contacts me: \r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for your continued contact with the Office of Tom Karinshak. I value the time you spent to contact us back today. I have once again have reached out to the Regional Executive team. I did explain that you have not been contacted. Please wait for their response since they are now your point of contact. Thank you for contacting XFINITY in regards to not being contacted. I want to assure you that we are committed to providing you with superior customer experience. As part of our XFINITY Customer Commitment, we are available to answer your questions at your convenience by phone online and through our mobile applications 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We value your business and thank you for being a loyal XFINITY customer.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs mentioned to you earlier, I reached out to Lori numerous times and of course no response. Gilbert is another perons in Tom K.\u2019s office that completely took a hands-off (not my responsibility) approach. I truly felt as if I had absolutely no options, and I mean none. Your company has a monopoly in this area on Internet service faster than 1.5 Mbps and you act like it. The only recourse I do have, I am planning to take. I am filing a complaint with my city, my state and the FCC to have your right to distribute Internet revoked in this area. My second recourse, which I am also happy to take is that I teach customer service for TWO very highly regarded training organizations, and I am going to be happy to use your company\u2019s name an example as how NOT to treat a customer. \r\n\r\nI am in front of over 1000 people a month, and I am looking forward to letting them know how you treat customers. Do not worry, I do not plan to say anything I cannot prove, I have emails and records for everything. I even have a screenshot of my phone documenting all the telephone calls I made to Raymond. If you would like to discuss this situation, I am more than happy to speak with you. I am also more than happy to send you all my emails and documentation that shows how your company abuses your customers.", "These people are ripoff artists with no integrity whatsoever. Been having problems with the internet since day one. It cuts out constantly. First time I called to try and fix it, the guy rebooted the connection and told me it could be the modem. So I changed my modem and bought a different brand. That didn't work. Then a tech came out and told me it was the cable. He put a new one but we are still having problems. Now I am stuck in a contract with this horrible company. They throttle speeds. What do I pay money for every month. I really loath Xfinity and will be searching for a new, high quality provider as soon as possible. Someone should take them to court and brutally sue them. They shouldn't be in business.", "Ok, I thought I would give this a try. I haven't been paying any attention about mega this or giga that up till I hit a terabyte. WOW, the rabbit hole is very deep and I jumped in with both feet. A TB = 1,048,576 mb and that averages 34 gb per day. On an average hd movie cost 2.5gb maybe 3 roughly per hour. I don't game, I don't binge movies and I dont have kids. 3 tvs, only one or two in use. 2 old tablets, 3 Rokus and one unplugged till we need it. And we chewed thru 1 tb in a month. I did my homework and then called Comcast and gosh oh golly have I ever seen so many knowledge people come up with nothing answers. They sent out a tech and he change a cable from my router to the wall, then went online and checked a few things and nothing. I'm serious, Nothing! No hackers, no piggyback neighbors.\r\n\r\nComcast has been great dealing with me and has returned calls and everything but I still don't get any serious answers. # 1 why doesn't Comcast have a meter report on each bill showing data usage each month, like the gas or electric companies and as for data usage this has been in the works for years and it's not like this started last week. I have a Nighthawk that shows me my data usage but there is no device on the average market that reads every device in your house separately. Comcast rep told me that only 1% of Comcast customers use 1 TB of data. I seriously challenge that. TVs in the house, gaming online, leaving your TV on all night long.\r\n\r\nI have my belief as to whats going on, but wait till 4K tvs really hit the market and EVERYONE owns one. You can kiss your Comcast bill goodbye for being reasonable. Next you'll be seeing petabytes before long and like everything else with no middle class because no one can afford paying $500 a month for BASIC cable. I dont smile, smirk and or make jest, I'm very serious. Comcast wants to make money, cool, but do you have to be so greedy. I know, stupid statement!", "I got a call from them offering me Internet Plus and HBO channels, and offered it to me for about $39, I said, \"Ok cool. I will try it\" and trusted them, so they mailed me the tv box and tried to install it and it didn\u2019t work. I called them twice and they didn\u2019t fix it. Third time they said they are going to send someone with a new tv box to see if the box I had was bad. The technician came out and fixed my tv and said the box they mail me wasn\u2019t working and changed with the one he brought with him and apologized. He offered me to fix the wires without mention anything about any fees or charges. I appreciated his help and gave him $20 tips. He apologized about the inconvenience and said he is going to take the defective box and make a note to Comcast not to charge me anything since it\u2019s their mistake. The technician asked me to use my bathroom which was a little awkward and left.\r\n\r\nSo the problem started when I got the first bill which was $131 and not $39 as I was promised. I called them and they said my package is $53 and not $39, and I was charged for the technician not like what he told me there is no charge, and they said the first box I had it missing and they are going to charge me monthly as long as I don\u2019t bring it back, but as I said the technician took the box with him. I keep calling them every time they tell me different story and they don\u2019t wanna fix the problem, and some of the agent were very rude and very unprofessional, so I told them to go check my recorded call who sold me this terrible package that he said I have a month money back guaranteed if I don\u2019t like the service. \r\n\r\nSo I said to the agent, \"Cancel everything. I don\u2019t anything anymore. My experience with you was awful and unpleasant and apply that term one month money back and take me back to my original package that was $19.99/month.\" They didn\u2019t honor their first promise and end up charging me $42.63. To sum up Comcast is a very misleading company, you can see lack of communication within their departments, they're not on same page and they don\u2019t keep their promises when they call first to make you sign for any deal. I was cheated and deceived, and they wasted too much of my time. If I could I will rate them a big 0.", "What a terrible company. Originally I was with CenturyLink for just internet for 12 Mbps for $31 a month. Then Xfinity/Comcast offered me the great deal of 60 Mbps for internet and 100+ channels for TV for a grand total (including taxes) $77. I agreed to the deal and signed up with them and canceled CenturyLink. Then the next day on my account I noticed I was only getting 30+ channels. I literally had to talk with 7 other agents all to find out they couldn't offer me the original deal because it wasn't a package. So not only did they not offer me anything for my troubles they also did not honor the deal that I was given. I don't think I've been more frustrated and upset at a company in my entire life. Will be canceling.", "My service is always going out. They do not follow through with appointments. They ran my credit without permission. They do not care for customers at all, worse customer service. Don't get Comcast internet.", "I've dealt with this company for 5+ years. For these years I've dealt with the worst internet I probably could ever experience. For about 3 months, I've had an ongoing issue where the internet's ping would spike up to over 300. I've called constantly, over and over and over again, about over 10 times if I could count, and they finally did something, not knowing what they did, to fix the issue. Then comes a day where Comcast calls us, claiming our router is damaged or broken, and they've shipped a new router to our house. The last router was working perfectly fine, and haven't experienced issues in 2 months. \r\n\r\nNow, this new router is even WORSE than the last router. For no reason at all, the internet connection drops for about 5 seconds every two minutes. I record gameplay for a YouTube channel, and it is almost impossible to get good gameplay for my audience without having Connection Timeouts. It happens three times every single day, and I have to restart my router every single time, for me to enjoy 4 to 5 hours of OK internet, then deal with this situation once again. I'm forced to use Comcast because they're the only internet provider nearby, which is the most unfortunate thing to ever happen. I pray to God another internet provider will build a place nearby, so I can switch to them instead of this horrid excuse for \"Fast, reliable internet\". I recommend you never try out Comcast.", "I had scheduled installation of their service for between 8 am and 10 am, the tech? (by the way these so called techs are not Comcast employees and they take no responsibility for there actions. So if they steal from you Comcast will do nothing). Anyway the work order was wrong, so the tech got in his truck and left. I called Customer service and was promised 3 times that there would be someone there by 10 am. At 10:30 am I called customer service again, was on hold for 12.5 minutes, this liar named Milik pick up the line and informed me he was in charge of all installation. \r\n\r\nHe also refused to take responsibility for the tech he was in charge of. I was told no one would be coming and he had rescheduled my installation for the following Thursday. Of course I ask him if he thought this was a satisfactory response. What I got was sidestepping and no direct response to my question. I ask to speak to his supervisor and was informed that were not in and he would make sure they called me that day. This is why I refer to him as a liar. They never called. Big surprise. Please do not believe anything these people tell you.", "Comcast is the worst company to ever exist. Customer service doesn't exist and they avoid you at all cost. Disconnecting your account on your own they still charge you continuously. If you didn't sign up for contract they bill you for early termination. Please ignore all complaints or concerns all emails and even use your own account. They purposely disconnect services and then later say that they're going to disconnected for non-payment.", "Comcast sucks eggs on Easter. We signed up for the 150Mbps service and it's great, when it works. Our service is normal for a couple of hours a day, then it drops down to 8-15Mbps. So slow that almost everything times out. I called many times, and it seems that whatever switching they do at their end sometimes works. For a short while. Eventually they recommend I replace my modem, so I did. No difference. Constant bouncing from 8Mbps to 150. So when I called again on Friday, they said that a technician would come to my house to check everything on Easter Sunday 5-7 PM. I hated to cancel our plans, but we needed to get our service back ASAP, as my wife and I both need it for work. I got about a dozen phone calls and text messages for 2 days reminding me of the appointment. Then on Sunday, they called me at 6:30 to tell me the technician might be a little late. OK, better late than never. \r\n\r\nThen they called again at 7, to let me know he will be here around 8. OK, I already wasted the day, but really need it fixed since it still at 8Mbps all day. At 8:30 PM, I called in to Comcast and they said the tech was still working his previous appointment and could we reschedule since he is already over his 12 hours for the day. We were very upset by that statement. How many days do we have to waste because Comcast cannot properly schedule their techs? And the kicker was an offer of $20 for the tech being late. $20 for waiting three and a half hours on Easter for nothing. We asked for a supervisor, and he stated we don't have to pay for service we don't get. Great! How about refunding the money I paid for the last 2 months. \"No,\" he said, \"We only have a record of you calling in once last month and once more 3 months ago.\"\r\n\r\nMy phone shows multiple calls last month, and the month before. He is adamant that any call I made in would be in their records. In essence, he is calling me and my phone liars. He will not refund any money, because they have no record of all the calls I made. So we will have to waste another day and hope a tech shows up. And hope he fixes the problem. And hope that Comcast will somehow record the calls I make to complain. In the meantime, I'll be using my phone as a hotspot. At least the cell service is reliable!", "Once again today, Comcast email is down. Second time in a week. Always having problems with their email service. Over the weekend, a phone tech tried to communicate with my modem and wiped it out completely. So bad, a technician had to come to the house to fix. Yet, they won't issue refunds. Their product is defective, but they take no accountability and just don't care. They supplement their lousy product with even worse customer service.", "I signed up for the internet essentials program with Xfinity which offered internet for low-income houses with school-age children for the cost of $9.95 per month.

I was never told of any new changes in there billing policy and never given the option to opt-out of and extra usage as when I signed up I was told my bill would be $9.95 flat. I called customer service on four separate occasions trying to talk with a manager and after many long waits on hold was told (each time) that a manager would have to call me back and it would take 48 hrs. It has been two weeks since the first call and I have still yet to receive a callback. Xfinity is dishonest and taking advantage of poor people overcharging for internet that is suppose to be $9.95.", "Words cannot express how horrible the company and their support are. It took me talking to 4 people to finally get someone who could actually help me. I work from home and rely on internet for my job, and the first person literally spend the whole time trying to upsell me services rather than trying to help me fix my internet which wasn't working, and then when I didn't accept his offers HE LITERALLY LEFT THE CHAT. By the time I got to the third person they were convinced it wasn't their fault and it was my modem\u2019s fault, and said that was the end of the story. Well, $100 and a new awesome modem later, it turns out it wasn't the problem after all. \r\n\r\nThe fourth person I contacted after all of this somehow was able to pinpoint the problem within a minute. How did it take going through 4 people, one of which forced me to spend money on a new modem, to get to the real issue? I then provided feedback about the experience through their website and the response I got didn't even acknowledge that they had done anything wrong, was basically just \"I see you're upset with the situation, that\u2019s not how we want Comcast to be perceived.\" LOL this company is an absolute joke, and I can't wait to have a different option for internet besides them. I don't care if it costs 10x as much, I'll make it rain on the new company and throw a party to celebrate.", "Usually, I don't write reviews, but this case crossed all boundaries. In a nutshell, it's hard to believe that a huge company like Xfinity could act this way. I used Xfinity internet services and paid $80/month at the same time when a friend of mine living in the same building using the same services with the same speed paid $60. The service I am talking about is the Internet package to 200/mbps with BlastPro package and no annual contract. But the story not about this. Once I checked my bank account and saw that Xfinity charged me $104 per month. I contacted support, and they said, \u201cOh you know, you use our services more than 12 months, and the offer was active for 12 months that's why we charge you more now.\u201d Without any notice, without my permission!\r\n\r\nI said, \"If the offer expired, disconnect me from the service, but who gave you the right to charge me more without my permission.\" I asked for the reimburse of the overpaid amount. After, the operator said, \u201cDon't worry. I have an excellent offer for you, the same service with the same conditions but for $40/month.\u201d I clarified several times about the speed and contract length and other terms, etc., because the offer was suspiciously good. They sent me a contract with the price $40, I signed. After a month I paid $40 for the service, but on the second month, I saw a bill almost $80/month. I contacted support again, and they said I am a liar, and they couldn't offer me the terms I described. I asked, \"Why I had a bill $40 for the first month?\" \"That's because we gave you credit for $20!!!\" That's it. This is how Xfinity ** me for the 1st time, but we agreed on the price $60/month.\r\n\r\nAfter a month, when I made regular monthly payment, the next day they disconnected me from the internet. I contacted them, they said, \u201cSorry, something went wrong, don't worry I will restart the service for you.\u201d The internet was restarted, and after several days I receive an email, \"Please sign an agreement,\" and the agreement with entirely different terms I had before they disconnected me. The internet speed changed from 200 to 60mbps and with minimum 12 months contract. And this is how Xfinity is trying to ** me for the second time. Now I am chatting again with their support, spending my time and now I save copies of all the conversations, I have with them and recommend you to do the same if you deal with Xfinity. Good luck you Xfinity if this is a way you do your business.", "I have spent the last 12 hours trying to get a block taken off an IP address that leads to four of the eight domains/websites that I own. These are innocuous websites, nothing remotely questionable, some of them haven't even been used yet, but for some reason Comcast put a block on them so that I can't access them BUT EVERYONE ELSE CAN! I can see on my web-stats program that people are visiting the sites. But I can't get to them. One rep at Comcast said this was a \"known issue\" that was under investigation but still no remedy.

I have Frontier Internet scheduled next week to install as I don't know what else to do except ditch Comcast.", "I had Xfinity Comcast service in Michigan. I relocated to Illinois. I called Xfinity Comcast to transfer my service to my new address. The lady on the phone was very helpful in setting everything up and everything was going good until I received a call from a collection agency saying I owed Comcast over $600!!! Apparently, they opened up an entirely new account at the new address and never closed my old account and didn't even get a hold of me about it this entire time. I found out from the collection agency! \r\n\r\nI called Comcast to find out what happened and they said the mistake happened because they spelled my name wrong on the new account (despite having the same social security number) and they would get back to me. A few weeks passed and I hadn't heard back, so I called again. Same story, it was their fault. They spelled my name wrong and that's why the old account was never closed, they will resolve the issue and to only make payments on the new account like I have been. \r\n\r\nTwo months later I see the collection agency is still listed on my credit score from Comcast. I called again! This time they tell me they have no record of me ever speaking with a representative from Comcast and there are no notes on my account. They also tell me there is nothing they can do because it's past 120 days of non payment even though I didn't know about it because I MOVED and when I did find out about it they kept giving me the runaround. They also have the nerve to tell me they don't transfer services between states!!! WHAT? \r\n\r\nWell your employees never told me this when I requested a transfer of services! THEN they have the nerve to tell me because my parents were still living there and using the services I had to pay the balance. SO IF IT WERE STRANGERS USING THE SERVICES IN MY NAME, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM AS WELL??? By the end of the conversation with a supervisor from Comcast named Kim, she literally told me it's somewhat their fault this happened and it's also my fault and to ask my parents (whom I don't talk to by the way) if they will pay the collection agency! \r\n\r\nThis company has no ethics, they don't admit when they are in the wrong, and blame their consumer. This whole thing has been a nightmare and I will never recommend Comcast ever! At least when I had Charter Spectrum they were honest when I canceled service when I moved. DO NOT GO THROUGH COMCAST XFINITY IF YOU CAN HELP IT!!! I'VE WARNED YOU!", "Modem burned out. MICHAEL that works in the business Comcast department help us out. He understood that we are a business and needed to have someone out to us fast and he got someone out to us same day! 1-2 hours! GREAT SERVICE!", "Comcast is the most frustrating, dysfunctional, and dishonest company I have ever encountered. Let me give you a quick rundown of my experience: YEAR 1: I sign up for 12-month internet-only plan at $44.99/month (You ACTUALLY pay about $55/month.) (There's also a $5/month discount if you do autopay and paperless billing, which I do from the start, but never receive the discount.). Around month 9 out of 12, Comcast raises our rate to $74.99/month with absolutely no explanation. I ALSO realize I have never received the promised $5/month discount. I call Comcast to fix the obvious billing mistake (FIVE TIMES, because they either accidentally hang up, or they don't fix the issue and I have to call back.). They eventually chalk the price increase up to a \"system error,\" and credit me what they overcharged. They tell me they'll enact the $5/month discount for the rest of the year (they never do). \r\n\r\nYEAR 2: - I sign up for another 12-month agreement at $44.99/month ($55/month) because Comcast was still the only option. Around month 9 out of 12, Comcast raises our rate to $100/month, but I don't realize it until near the end of the contract. ALSO, we have STILL never received the $5/month discount. I call multiple times, trying to solve the issue. Again, Comcast chalks the mistake up to a \"system error,\" and promises to refund what they overcharged. The following month's bill is for $100, and there's no refund. \r\n\r\nPlanning to not-renew Comcast services, I schedule an install with AT&T, who has JUST moved to our area. I call Comcast to cancel the service at the end of the agreement (You have 30 days to cancel a new contract without any fees.). They blame the billing mistake on me and claim that I owe them money. I explain the situation, they investigate further, realize it was THEIR mistake, apologize, and say the refund is coming, and I need to return the equipment within 10 days. \r\n\r\nA week later, I still have not received the promised refund. I return Comcast's equipment in-person within 10 days and speak with a representative about my refund. This representative is extremely rude and yet again blames the billing mistake on me. The rep looks at the system (after complaining about having to actually do her job) and realizes that it was in fact COMCAST'S FAULT. \r\n\r\nApparently, when they fixed the billing mistake in the first year, they \"accidentally\" backdated the 12-month agreement, so their time frame was actually off for both contracts.). She says they'll (FINALLY) process the refund and we will be all good. 1 week later, I get a bill for $291 for \"unreturned digital equipment\" and a \"previous unpaid balance.\" (First of all, I returned ALL equipment in-person. Second, not only have I always had AUTO-PAY, but THEY OWE ME MONEY, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND). I just got this bill today, so we'll see what happens. All I know is you're better off bashing your head against a brick wall than you are signing up for any Comcast services.", "I am having the XFinity Triple Play: Internet 5, basic cable and voice. I have selected a basic cable plan in order to lower the monthly subscription. Even then the monthly bill comes out to be quite high, around $110. I tried online to change the plan but I was not allowed to do so. The Comcast online website only allows to upgrade the services. \r\n\r\nWhile calling the Comcast customer service to help me lower my monthly bill, I have asked them to get me the Internet only plan and to remove the existing Voice and basic cable services. First of all, the customer service was not helpful at all and told me that even with the Internet only plan, my monthly bill would be the same. When I asked them about the Internet only plan advertised online, their response was that it's for a new customer only. Second of all, the advertised plans are not giving the actual figures, the total bill is inflated by about 40% or more, shown as hidden figures under the titles: Broadcast TV fee, Reg. Sport Fee, Univ, Connect fee, equip rental, blast, etc... Finally, I have found the Comcast customer service not at all helpful when you ask for lowering the bill and just confuses you further by repeating the same thing again and again and going in circle!", "Comcast is over priced. I can't just get internet. I have to get a packets that has the high speed. DVR sucks. It skips and freezes plus it loses the sound. Just hate Comcast.", "If I had any other choice within my budget, I would choose any other provider. Comcast raise rates with no notice, it takes days to weeks for them to straighten out billing issues, and their phone customer service wait times surpass ridiculous.", "Comcast, over the years has developed a monopoly on the service, generally the service is reliable, with the exception of periods of strong storms. The viewing options on Comcast have unacceptable high prices and if you require in home service they charge $25.00 an hour to fix their equipment. I eliminated the television viewing of Comcast, because I no longer wanted a bill for $200 or more to watch TV. I now have the internet only with the highest speed for purposes of streaming programs, reducing my bill to about $70.00 a month.", "Comcast has consistently overcharged me each month for my internet service. Comcast also slows down my internet service, while I'm paying for Blast Speed Internet. Comcast has charged me for technicians to come to my home when they clearly stated they would not charge me, because the error was on their end. Comcast customer service reps are not helpful and can never explain why my bill is consistently inching higher each month. Speaking to someone in Corporate is IMPOSSIBLE! COMCAST Scams its customers with billing them for two months of service. The bill is set up to keep you guessing about your bill. I have paid my bill down to a ZERO BALANCE with Comcast and the next bill is ALWAYS OVER 100.00 DOLLARS! COMCAST NEED TO BE STOPPED WITH THESE UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES! It's horrible that, they are getting away with the things they are doing to the consumers!", "I tried to get Comcast service and was denied, because my EX-HUSBAND owes them money!!! They said that because we have the same last name, I am denied service. What a joke. Good thing I am already a FiOS customer.", "Here is the short version. If you get a call from Comcast and you currently only have Internet and don't want another convoluted bill, then just say no. And if you do decide to go with the pure internet Xfinity plan, the Xfinity stream app does NOT work on any other device other than Roku. The one box we did not have. I also clarified I wanted to use it on our Apple TV which I was told we could. So after ordering that, we still did not get the one channel I was making sure we had. Bravo. And today another fun bill just like I used to get with the boxes in the house. A bunch of nonsense and convoluted overages. Also they added extra billing options I did not order. That's it...more wasted time to a company that has continued that trend since the day I started with them.", "Had cable and internet less than 24 hours and experienced internet issues. Called the automated system to resolve but did not fix the issue. Called customer service/tech support. It was resolved by creating a new internet name. When I asked what the issue was, the representative would not provide the information, only that it was fixed. He was very rude, he told me I was causing issues. I responded, I was a paying customer and had a right to know what the issue was and if it was going to continue. I asked for his name and to speak to his supervisor, he gave me a fake name and hung up on me.", "We've had Comcast for many years, primarily because they are the only remotely decent service in our area. And we live in a city, not a remote location. However, through countless modem and cable box updates and revisions, signal checks on the line, technician visits, etc. I have NEVER gotten a speed test from any website, router, or even from Comcast itself that showed me that I was getting anywhere near the speed I was paying for. When I paid for 50 Mb, I was getting 10. When I paid for 100, I was getting 20 or 30. Now, my plan supposedly gives me 150. And I've never seen anything higher than 30.\r\n\r\nPart II of the problem is that every time I speak with someone on the phone or in person at the store, I have to start over. They insist on running through a lengthy checklist of laborious and time-consuming diagnostics each and every time, all of which show nothing useful. So, the problem is never resolved. I complain again. I write letters. I escalate to managers who make promises. Periodically they refund some or all of a month's service. In fact, they offer up the refund sooo quickly... Well, it feels like they do it a lot, and obviously make so much money that it doesn't bother them to do it multiple times rather than address the problem.\r\n\r\nPart III of the problem is that their customer service people on the phone or in person are NOT technical people. They easily trip over their own bad diagnostic logic and waste hours of my time. And if you express any level of dissatisfaction about the process, their first response is to threaten a hang up. (Just my opinion, but it seems like the first response to an angry customer should be to call in a manager.) I'm willing to accept the possibility that I got a bad egg. But that's not fixing anything. A few years ago I discussed switching to another area provider, only to get an ear-full from friends, family and co-workers that pretty much everyone does the same thing. They all wanted to switch also, but didn't feel like any options were an improvement. I suspect that if Comcast answered the phone with humans instead of robots that verify you for 10 minutes, the cost of those wages would motivate them to resolve issue more quickly.\r\n\r\nAs it is, I haven't met anyone who doesn't just assume Comcast cheats everyone uniformly as a matter of internal policy. They jack up your bill if you let the contract lapse. They throttle your download speed. And don't even get me started on the cable TV. What I'm describing here is the perception of this service provider, and it doesn't bother them. Complaints are rampant, but they are not held accountable by anyone. They ignore the complaints. My measly little $2400 a year I give to them means nothing to them and they treat me like that. What happened to courtesy? Pride in your work? The customer is king? We're addicts. I get it. And Comcast isn't a waiter in a nice restaurant. They're a drug dealer in a back alley. And they want you to believe you're in no position to make demands.\r\n\r\nConsider this: If you BUNDLE everything together... cable, Internet, phone, security... you're trapped. Or, you will believe you are. Here's a suggestion for how to wean yourself off of that. You assembled it in pieces... take it apart in pieces. Cancel and replace one service at a time. There ARE other providers, that aren't as good. But if you're going to get crud service, you might as well pay less for it. If you're thinking about getting Comcast for anything, think about writing your representatives instead. Ask for regulation, consumer protections, oversight. Maybe nothing will happen, but it doesn't hurt to ask.", "In Baytown TX, I pay $50.00 for 3MBPS, Comcast cable modem is a shared system the more users the slower the internet. New customers can order up to 150 MBPS for $55.00 a month. This is an unfair monopoly that gouges their existing customers. Cell phone providers are telecommunications providers, why can they have more than one can operates in a city.", "I work from home. I have had countless experiences where my internet went out for a day, but never three days straight. On March 30 at 7:45am when I tried to work, I couldn't access the internet. Called Comcast, they sent a signal and tried saying I needed a new modem and should sign up for their service protection plan in case I incur charges due to it being a problem on my end should they have to come out. I assured them that nothing had happened on my end as I lock up my office every day after I am done and that up until their \"outage\" my modem router worked fine. I called again after talking my job's IT department who insisted the problem was due to my internet service provider. Finally, a rep told me that they had an outage and it should be resolved within a couple of hours and offered to text me when it was restored. \r\n\r\nHours later, I received a text. I tried logging on, no access still. I called back and the rep said that the outage was still going on and that it was impacting over 300,000 in our area due to something going on in Troutdale. Then he assured me that it would be addressed by 6pm. 6pm came and went, with no internet service. I thought perhaps it was due to needing my modem router being outdated or affected by the outage. \r\n\r\nNext day, I called again, as I was trying to make up my missed hours for work. Still, no internet service and told that there was still an outage going on but that it would be addressed later that afternoon and that they could call me when it was fixed. I received the automated call and when I returned home, I still couldn't access the internet... I called Comcast yet again and I explained that I worked from home, didn't have time to play around and asked if they could schedule an appointment since I was still having issues after the outage was restored. \r\n\r\nSo we set up an appointment for Easter, 04/01/18 for 2 to 4pm despite it being a holiday because after all, I must work. I left my family to meet Comcast at my house from 2 to 4 and despite the notification that we had an appointment scheduled, no one from Comcast ever showed up. I called yet again and the lady told me that I never had an appointment. I said, \"Gee, that's funny. How did I get this confirmation of my scheduled appointment?\" Then she changed her story. \"Oh, we cancelled it because there was still an outage so there was no point in coming with an outage.\" I said, \"Well, you didn't cancel it with me. Is that how Comcast does business?\" She apologized and said \"I understand your frustration.\" I said, \"I don't believe you do. \r\n\r\nI work from home. This is impacting my ability to work and earn a living. And then on top of that, you accuse me basically of lying about an appointment, then you say it was cancelled, and then I waste time on Easter to make sure I am home for this appointment and no one ever calls to cancel it with me and no one bothers to show.\" Then she schedules another appointment, with the next appointment available on April 5th from 10 to 12pm. Oh how great. Now I can go almost a whole week with no way to work. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, when I call to ask for a letter from them to provide to my employer, they flat out refused. And again, try to sell me on a Comcast Business Account. No thanks!!! If my green money isn't valuable to Comcast as a Comcast Residential Account, why would I want to pay more money to Comcast? I wouldn't recommend anyone use Comcast for their needs. The only thing worth noting is that they paid $20 for the no-call no show, only after I told them that they would reimburse me for my wasted time. Sorry to see that they don't offer this to all of their customers, after reading the previous review from another Comcast customer. I guess they pick and choose who they will show decent human respect to and it's obviously not the residential accounts.", "If you need customer service it's better to go into store and meet with them directly. They are great. If you call whomever you get is usually rude and doesn't know what they are doing. Reliability is good. Only a few issues due to storm but took the boxes back to store and they replaced them in a matter of minutes.", "Several times during the week I don't receive a signal especially in the morning. I contact Comcast and follow their prompts to restore the signal and most times it doesn't work. When I turn it on in the afternoon or evening it is fine. I was told by Comcast that the cable box is defective and to return it to one of their stores and they will replace it or I could pay $15 for them to mail it to me. Since this box is defective they should send a technician out to replace the box instead of inconveniencing the customer to replace their defective product.", "Customer service is awful, rates are ridiculously high; service constantly boots; the same programs/movies are constantly ran. Customers should not have to pay a month in advance for services they haven't yet received. Bills have constantly been questioned.", "The speed that I am paying for is not delivered, and when you call to find out about why this is happening they completely ignored your question and tell you that what you have as a big favor is a \"promotional deal\". In the past when I switched to DirecTV from Comcast TV service, they sent a tech to cut off all my connections of every room in my house which I already have paid $385.00 to have it done. They did not have any right to do that! They did it out of despite for me switching to another provider due to the poor service provided by Comcast!", "Disappointed with the internet speed at 100mbps. I still get buffering even if I'm in the same room as the modem! Too many issues with program access and \"temporary\" problems. Service should be more reliable than that. They have no issue setting up payments though and taking your money asap. I'd like to have more choices in providers. Otherwise no one will upgrade their service.", "I've stuck with this company over 20 years, I have discontinued cable since I believe that their prices are outrageous, but expensive though it may be, their internet can't be topped. In this case, you get what you pay for. But with the installation, they left cables running across my yard and driveway more than two years, no one ever came back and buried them, and calling them to get anything done is a lesson in futility. When I was charged for both unlimited data, and for surpassing a data cap I paid not to have, it took 45 minutes, and supplying my personal data multiple times to multiple people, for them to tell me that they couldn't get approval to fix my bill for at least three days. Still, in my experience, the speed of the internet, and the stability of the connection, make all the customer service hassles bearable.", "I don't think any internet service is faster than the next. Comcast did not do installation. We did it. Equipment was shipped to us. There was problem with reception they sent guy out, ran new cable to box and cable is on the ground.", "Comcast is ok but I am sure that other providers are better. Our service is a package that includes tv, phone service and the internet. Comcast is very hard to actually talk to a service person when we are having problems.", "Overall no complaints about the service or the company; the internet plans are pricey for the offered speeds as compared to other internet providers like Verizon.", "I like Comcast/Xfinity service. Their customer service is great; their speed however, NOT SO Great! AND installation was done primarily by us. I feel there is room for improvement on installation; everything they personally install, they charge WAY TOO much; trying to force people to self install no doubt.", "Service and installation personnel competent and helpful but continual rate increases, opaque billings, difficulty getting phone help and phone help often unintelligible.", "Comcast/Xfinity offers many apps, excellent customer service and when there is an occasional outage it is quickly resolved. My only issue is the rates, if not bundled with other service internet rate seems a little high.", "Comcast is great but when you call for certain service you end up getting someone who barely speaks English; therefore, making the customer service horrible. I wish company would stop outsourcing their customer service.", "Customer service sucks. They don\u2019t know what they are doing. I got a 50 dollar package and it has like 7 Channels. That\u2019s not what the stupid advertisement said. The quality of the t.v. is awful. I\u2019ve never in all my years Seen a t.v. Look so bad. It\u2019s a fairly new t.v. Oh and don\u2019t get me started on the Internet service, it\u2019s worst ever! Right before they were suppose to come and install the cable I had seen another package, so I asked if I could upgrade and no one knew how to do that. Worst experience ever!", "Price is obscene - many times what Europeans pay for same type of service - greedy company.", "The customer service is terrible and when you go to visit the store it's the same. They all this new technology and do not know anything about it. It just don't work. We have problems all the time.", "For years, they were our only choice. They were horrible! Prism came in and changed everything, love Prism, hated Comcast. Comcast had horrible outages almost daily, reception was bad, said I was too far away from the station, everything about them bad.", "I have been a Comcast/Xfinity customer for 30+ years. The service is always good. They offer everything comparable to other companies. Pricing is high; however, all other companies are comparable in price for the same options you request. No company beats out the other company.", "Comcast/Xfinity recently upgraded my speed at no extra cost. We are pleased with the service and the consistency of my internet connections. We have had this service for about a year and never had a problem.", "Comcast is a little high. We have to keep them because we can't get any station unless we have some kind of connection service. I pay over a hundred dollars and still can't get the station I want.", "I was unimpressed. Had an internet-only Blast! package at a slightly discounted price for one year. Cancelled today as I am moving. The router hardware that I \"leased\" from them was subpar. Not only did we not get the download speeds we were promised, but service would cut in and out at random times, and we were promised WiFi support for 8-10 devices but our devices would be getting kicked off with only one person connected. While their app offers interesting capabilities and data, it is rather clumsy and slow, as is their website. \r\n\r\nWhen I tried to cancel it took me an inordinately long time to even find out how to cancel; it's like they thought that if I couldn't find a cancellation option then I wouldn't cancel. That was irritating and unhelpful. The customer service agent I chatted with either had poor typing skills or a poor grasp of English, and I ended up with a surprise bill at the end. All-in-all this service will do the basic job, but don't expect more than that.", "Worst cable co. in the whole country. Customer service is of no help, they are rude and condescending, talk down to you. The updates that they say need to be done EVERYDAY, are worthless, one of the reasons we got rid of AOL, update interruption while you're in the middle of a movie. Setting the time is stupid, I'm up at different times. Thank God we are leaving PA soon and won't have to deal with Comcast much longer. Got to stop the cable monopoly Comcast holds on the state.", "Speed is our issue, but with upgrades it is getting better. Customer service is very supportive and very helpful. They seem to answer the phone in a speedy manner.", "I actually feel Comcast has been very good in sending out workers if there is a problem. But most problems can be handled by phone. We have had no interruption issues.", "Installer was very amateurish. He draped cables all over the place inside and out. I had to reroute wires outside of rain gutters and roof corners. Bundling helps in the short term, but rates continue to rise. About ready to ditch service.", "Have never had a problem with the internet that couldn't be fixed almost immediately and problems are few and far between. Neighbors have tried other companies with terrible results and very slow speeds.", "Comcast Internet customer service is something to be desired. But the actual service is good. I don't think the service I am getting is as fast as they say. It seems that compared to other services, we don't lose service as much.", "I recently moved to a new area and had to switch providers. I had a couple of choices and was, at first, a little leery of Comcast due to so many comments, etc. But I am very pleased with their service. The install went smooth, the service has been solid and they recently raised my speed for no extra charge. I'm a very happy customer.", "How does a person know what speed their service is really? Net neutrality has opened the door for deregulation and higher cost at will, I'm experiencing already.", "Services generally good, the usual short blackouts on tv, and slow uploading at times.

It's a service I would never use again or recommend to anyone.", "Charge too much money for too little service. Billing keeps going up every month and service never gets any better. Phone service stinks, whenever you call you can never get anyone from the US unless you ask and then they tell you that they have to contact them and that someone will call you back.", "Customer service transfers calls to another department when they want to give you the runaround.

The shows seen on Comcast are so old like Coming to America. They still showing. They get you with the package deal thing because if you upgrade to a Disney Channel you being charged for a different package where you force into a new two year contract. Which is another robbery. Then there the incentive 200.00 if you sign on to triple play deal. But what they don't tell you till it's time to get it you can't get it until after 6 months of payments. It's not a free gift card because after 6 months you paid for it.", "They schedule appointments and do not show.

I think they need more competition and an overhaul in leadership.", "I've used other internet services, including AT&T, but the Comcast/Xfinity has been my internet provider now for several years, including at my new home.

They repeat the same thing over and over, it takes days for them to fix the issue, you have to hold hours to get the right department.

I called to have unlimited data added to my package and was told absolutely nothing would change and that it would be an additional $25 a month to what I was currently paying. After receiving the text message to confirm that my unlimited data was being added I asked the representative please send me something so I would know that my package would not be changing and would remain the same amount. I was told \u201ceverything is staying the same including the monthly amount and that the only thing adding to my plan was unlimited data which would be an additional $25 a month.\u201c\r\n\r\nI believed what the Comcast representative told me therefore I signed off on it. The following morning I received an email with the information on voice calling. Considering I had not signed up for any changes to my current plan which did not include voice calling I immediately called a Comcast representative. After being on hold for quite some time the representative finally explained to me that I had signed off on it and that it did not matter what the representative told me I was locked into a concrete new contract for 24 months with the price increase per month.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining on hold for an hour and a half while they did some investigation I finally requested that a manager return my call. Needless to say her name was Stephanie and she was very rude very loud filled with sarcasm and did not listen to anything I had to say but rather talk over me. I still was unable to get verification of what was on my account now other than the fact that there was a price increase and that I was locked into it for 24 months. One more reason why Comcast should not be in business and should not be allowed to get away with these fraud tactics.", "Xfinity used to be Comcast. They might as well have been called con cast. They used to lie a lot. Then they got better. I've had their service for 5 years now, and it's only been extremely bad since I reduced my services with them since I had more important things come up that cost money. When I had the inside line maintenance plan, which I paid for, they never sent anyone out for the problems I was having. All the problems were outside ones. Once I changed my service plan, the maintenance plan was removed and I wasn't told about it until 2 months later. I started having more and more issues. Internet service-mail servers down constantly making it hard for me to check my mail. Slow internet when told they were speeding it up. Unknown devices logging in to my account. Someone trying to hack my account. All this, as every month my bill gets higher and higher. I still pay the way I used to, and they never charged me a late fee. \r\n\r\nSince I reduced my services, they've charged me for 2 tech visits and I will not let them send anyone else out. The first tech visit was to work on the new modem I was told by phone tech support to order because my modem, from Comcast, was a glitchy model. So I get the new one and it's the same issue. Freezing screen, getting kicked offline, email servers at Comcast down... Tech comes out and puts a new line in, then says my DVR is going to be the next to go, and as he said that, he conveniently dropped his meter onto the drop of my DVR. So, the DVR dies and also my tv goes off. He had to work on the DVR a bit to get it to work again. My tv was fine after awhile. I got charged 60 for this visit. I called and complained about it. They said they'd do me a favor and credit me for the visit. In other words, even though they charged me, they said they'd remove the charge. \r\n\r\nSo, a couple weeks later, I start having trouble with the DVR. I call in and they send a tech out with a new DVR. I get billed 60 for that too. I told them I needed a new DVR because of the damage the previous tech did. I didn't think I'd be billed for something that had been caused by one of their employees, but I was billed. I've spoken with them repeatedly and complained to them repeatedly. I'm getting nowhere with them. When I was paying a lot of money, they were more than willing to give me credits toward my bill. And they were actually able to help. Now... I keep getting told there's nothing they can do to help me. I've had disappearing emails and was connected to their security people that help with that specifically, and still got told, nothing we can do to help. Customer service lies through their teeth left and right. \r\n\r\nOnce again, it's one thing from one of them, and the opposite from another one. They keep saying they'll have a supervisor call me and they never do. The only people that truly seem to want to help, are the ones in other countries. They offer a credit here and there, but the reps here don't even acknowledge it. Maybe, just maybe, there is no interoffice communication between the foreign country call centers and the US based ones. I'm not sure. What I am sure of though, is not too long ago, people were complaining about Comcast and I told them they were better than they used to be. I should've never said anything nice about them. Because it wasn't long after that, that they did a total shift in the way they treated me. Not to mention all the problems I started having. In fact, during all this mess, I started having virus and malware issues that I've never had. Never had viruses or malware. \r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, I start getting things that were problems for people back in 2012-2014. I call Norton and they tell me that there is nothing they can do about the problems because it's part of Microsoft's system. Norton connects me to Microsoft and it just goes south from there. I will never call Norton again. And I definitely will never ever do a live chat with Microsoft. I'M starting to think that it's all a setup. Comcast lines us up and Norton or Microsoft knocks us down. With Comcast, you get Norton for free. Maybe that's the problem. If ya don't pay Comcast enough money, you're going to get really bad service. From them and everyone else their company uses. I told them I was going to do this and also file a complaint with the BBB. I've absolutely had it with this company. If I could use a different one, I would in a heartbeat. \r\n\r\nThe building I live in has a contract with them unfortunately. Comcast does not deserve to have a contract with an entire building of over 200 residents. We don't deserve to be stuck with their horrible service and all of their lying, overcharging, rigging and not repairing... Not to mention, the techs give you their names and numbers and when you call them, you find out they've given you false information! I'd rather be homeless and living on the streets than have to pay for Comcast's service. At least then, I could afford a cell phone. And I will never get one through Comcast. They will get no extra money from me. In fact, it's just a matter of time before one, or both of us, cut my service off.", "Rep Rudy in Jacksonville, FL was rude and was horrible.

Once I sign the contract Comcast refuse to recognize this contract, instead they try to sell me a different contract with more than doubled the money. I refuse to accept this deal so I cancel the contract within the first month so there will be no liabilities on my part.

Was paying $110.71 per month for 100 mbps internet, never got even 50 mbps, but most of the time I didn't have it at all. Didn't have even one month that I didn't have to call them and argue. Comcast representatives promised me reimbursements for bad service and absence of the internet for extensive period of time and weeks later denied it without any notification, saying that they had changed their minds. Company charges ridiculous amount of money for their services and keeps customers from leaving by giving false promises. Spent hours on the phone with them. Then I got tired and I switched to Fios.

Out of all of the companies we have had to deal with Comcast has been the worse. We sent ADT home security a copy of my husband's driver's license and they had no issues with it. We sent Comcast the exact same copy and they continue to tell us that they cannot read it. We filled out their entire fraud package, had it notarized, had it witnessed, sent them everything they initially requested in the fraud package and they still want more. Again, worst company to deal with and we are not even their customers. We are victims of fraud. I can't imagine how they actually treat their own customers.

The only way to get a decent deal is to tell them you want to cancel. I was having problems with the connection going out. They sent a service tech, he was Russian and rushing and didn't speak enough English where we could understand each other. They would not rewire my home. they would only wire up to my modem, so now I can't use the modem in the other 2 rooms that were previously rewired because the tech said it was the splitter.\r\n\r\nThen one day we had an outage. I saw it on my app. But my internet never came on and they could not find my modem from online. They said they would send someone but if it's my equipment I would have to pay. I had no choice. The guy said the line from the pole was bad. He was able to replace it, this guy spoke English and he did a great job and my service is good now, but the previous tech should have seen this because he touched the line to the box and said it was \"crunchy\". It was old and dried out and part of the reason I had the first problem.\r\n\r\nThey also don't tell you when your renewal is up and then raised your rates really high and then if you get new plan they tell you they already billed for the higher rate which you prepay so you haven't even used and tell you to ** basically.

They slow down internet speeds as soon as the payment is late. 2. TV reception is hindered. 3. The sneakiest one of all. They block access to on demand rentals, but don't say the reason. Instead (did someone say \"sneaky\"?) they use an error message which says \"a subscription is required to view\". Why don't they just say because you haven't paid your bill?

I asked to speak to her boss and he was nice but could not do anything but schedule to get somebody out tomorrow. \r\n\r\nI asked to be sent to retention so I could at least get my Showtime and HBO back which they cut off last night being that we have no internet. Bottom line sorry, no documentation of anything yet I can give them names of who said what. They do not stand behind what their employees offer and have no answers. The retention department said they would have a manager call me and I have yet to hear from him. First thing in the morning we will be calling ATT and DirecTV. I have wasted hours upon hours with these people and I for one am done. I don't have many choices and ATT here is terrible but at least it is steady.", "6 years of dealing with the world\u2019s worst company who would rather Ignoring their terrible pricing structure designed to make you pay AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Their customer support doesn\u2019t care, will lie to you and is just plain useless most of the time.

Yes the same modem they\u2019re charging me to \u201crent\u201d. Which they also JUST had me upgrade it the year before. Comcast. If it were possible to give 0 stars like you deserve I would. Also, let\u2019s not forget these stupid data caps you\u2019ve shoved down our throats. 99% of people don\u2019t use 1TB is absolute crap. Even if that were true why doesn't paying for a faster speed increase your cap? One word. Greedy.\r\n\r\nAs an IT professional I\u2019m aware that networking is expensive, but most of these systems you have are in place and data \u201cusage\u201d should have little to no effect especially considering how you throttle each customer in a given area during high load times (or your aging equipment simply can\u2019t handle it). Either improve your infrastructure or pocket the money. I don\u2019t have to tell you which Comcast is doing. In short: Thanks for 6 years of terrible service. Cannot wait for the opportunity to drop you. The moment something comparable/better comes along, I\u2019d gladly pay double simply to be rid of you. Consider that Comcast executive. We are NOT happy. Very few business survive when customers are not happy and YOU have just been lucky, forceful, manipulative and the only one around. We\u2019ll break up soon.

Wow, what a rip-off Comcast Xfinity is by comparison! Upload speeds from Comcast are ridiculously slow. They never achieve top speeds for my product (s/b 150 mbs down, but 135 mbs is average). Compared to Cox, I paid less and achieved up and download speeds much higher than the guaranteed minimum for my package; sometimes 3 times faster than what I was paying for. Cox customer service is excellent. Comcast people are unreliable - I always call twice to see if I got the correct info. Cox: two or three outages in ten years. Comcast: two outages in last 4 months. I believe Comcast is blocking higher speeds. Could be my location (more rural now than suburban) but still this is CA - freaking technology here should be the best in the world.", "I have been stuck with Comcast for 3 and half years because they had my account info messed up. My internet run at 300kbps when I pay for the highest speed internet (blast tier). Never did get above kbps because for years they wouldn't send a tech out to my home because the customer service overseas lies and tells me to call my ** computer manufacturer to fix my internet speed for the 3 laptop and 2 desktop I own which is just flat out **. I have a Bachelors in IT. I know how the ** internet works.", "If it can get worse it will. From price, to speed and reliability it is just disgusting. This is why we need net neutrality people. Comcast improves nothing but it's bottom line at the customer's expense with little choice. Run and run fast if you can!", "Xfinity has gotten a lot better, but there still room to improve. Just about daily I have to reset my Internet. Not sure of the cause and customer service is clueless. I hate when I have to call customer service and most times I cannot understand a customer service agent and they don't seem to understand me based on their responses to my questions. Also, the speed varies depending on the time of day. Like everyone else when you most need the speed it's considerably slower.", "I have had only good results from Xfinity. Good internet speed. Good service. Very happy with their program. It works for me. I have had repair out only 1 time in 6 years and no waiting or late appointment. Great job.", "Overall I am pleased with Comcast. I have not had any issues that have not been resolved in a timely and satisfying manner.", "I canceled my internet service and then my alarm, but instead they took it upon themselves to restart a contract for my alarm service. I have called over 15 times to resolve this and was told by several agents that this would be taken care of and it WAS NOT. I called for the 16th time and spoke with Sasha ** and she was rude, disrespectful and in need of customer service training. I ask Sasha to transfer me to a supervisor and she puts me on hold and comes back and says this is a early termination fee, I asked for a supervisor again and just sits on the phone for a minute (I could hear her background) then placed me on hold and comes back and says every supervisor and manager are in a meeting.\r\n\r\nI questioned her, she offered a callback and I asked for a number I can call the supervisor with or a name. She said she can't give a name they have several, THEN SHE HUNG up on me. I should not have had to call so many times about the exact same issue, I was told it was taken care of and it was not.

We just have his name as the primary for the stupid 1 year promotional deal since our original bill doubled after the year was over. I've paid for Comcast since the creation of this account. My roommate has since moved out of state while I stayed and continued to pay. I've since moved out and so they refunded me the additional amount they took out due to auto pay. They've mailed me a check to his name. I've called to fix this issue and they said they couldn't do anything about it; not even recredit the credit card it came from (which was mine). \r\n\r\nThe agent I talked to said if he authorizes me as an account user, they can fix it. I called back with him on the line to another agent for him to add me as an authorized user but this person said that didn't change anything. Refund can only be sent to someone other than the primary account user only if they are deceased or no longer using the service (WHICH HE IS NOT) yet they still said there's nothing they can do. Basically, they had no problem taking my money for a year yet they refused to refund it to me after I canceled the service. Unreal. This is by far the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of working with. Service is spotty, their call center are always seemingly helpless, and their technicians are rude slackers that chill out in their van in front of your house until they decide to report that they're done with the job.

I am still being charged for equipment.", "My latest experience with Xfinity started off really bad. The sales rep who signed me at the PGH Home Show was pathetic in doing his job to my satisfaction. His failure to follow up and see to it that I retained my home phone number caused me a lot of time, frustration, and money. I spent countless hours on the phone with customer support from my former ISP and Xfinity to finally get the problem resolved. But a very nice lady at Xfinity customer service went above and beyond to make everything right. Since then all is well. Let's hope it continues. I was just about to cut the cord and not look back. Cable TV/Internet access and landline phone service prices are getting out of hand and it won't take much to cut that cord if push come to shove.", "Unfortunately, the internet speeds seems to fluctuate.

If you are Smart, Stay AWAY!!!", "I have no other choice than to use Comcast at this time as far as I know for internet service. They are a generally good company but don't like being pushed to purchase more and more complex technology which has happened. I have neither the money nor the desire nor the expertise or interest to install or even use anything to the future. Customer service is overall good when there is a problem with the service, but I did have a couple of times repeat problems with phone, TV and internet that took over a month to fully resolve assuming they are fully resolved. Not a 5 star company but certainly a 4 star one.", "Great company with great service. Very good price for service offered. Good internet connection & speed... Love!", "The service is overpriced.

Not inexpensive, but competitive at least when I really have no other option.

Sometimes having to wait to speak to a rep. can be annoying. I would recommend to others.", "The Comcast Internet Service treats new customers better than established customers. Their equipment is not good (modems). They misrepresent agreements verbally, they make it very, very difficult to actually see a copy in writing. Then you find out that parts of the 24 month agreement are only for 12 months so the bill will go up in 12 months, not 24. Very shady practices and if they didn't have special arrangements with Seattle City Council we'd actually have a choice of other provider.", "Price seems high, and service isn't 100% reliable.

I get Comcast through Spectrum and I can't feel more RIPPED OFF!!!", "Satisfied except for the price.", "Love Xfinity! Can shut it down when up north. Keep equipment and activate online!

Each time before I could talk to a rep I was instructed to disconnect and reconnect my modem. When that didn't work the automated system \"sent me a signal\" and I had to wait 1/2 hour and then call back. Even then, to talk to a rep was a 2 hour wait. Then they sent \"repair\" signals and other stuff I don't understand. \r\n\r\nFinally one rep told me she thought my modem was bad so she suggested I go to the local store and exchange it.

I called 5 months in a row to get unlimited data. Each month they kept charging me for going over data limit. I canceled my service after a couple of months later when AT&T came in. Two months later they finally sent a tech to pick up the equipment. I get a final bill of $500 through a collection agency, now offering me a \"deal\" of only $350.

I call back to COMCAST. I get Spanish speaker this time. I finally get a supervisor, and he tells me there is nothing he can do. I then tell him I want reimbursed for the 5 months they overcharged me for not getting my unlimited data. He says no.

So, in all, I waited 4.5 hours for a tech to tell me he was not going to do anything. Called the 800#. Got the run-around from their service department (reading prepared scripts), in the Philippines. Promised me a supervisor would call the next morning at 8am my time. Never called. These guys should be banned by local municipalities, or at least fined for being so incompetent.

They should be embarrassed, but can't hear you because the cash register is making too much noise.", "They promise one thing and deliver another. They treat customers well only until you have started using their services. I had very bad experience with the billing where $50 which was taken as a service startup deposit and was promised to be adjusted in first month bill was not removed. I was asked to pay $75 (for $25 plan) only after I had called them 3-4 times. Worst... Will never use Comcast... They bluntly asked me cancel the service after apologizing that their promises were false...", "Too expensive and too unreliable/unpredictable.

I called customer services again explaining why I shouldn't be charged with this much money and the employee on the phone basically told me that any kind of technician hired will always cost $40.

The service can at times be brilliant and incredibly fast, so fast, it's like being at my work where we have entire room dedicated to maintaining the speed and security of all our computers, like a lot of businesses. Those times are not the norm though, more like maybe 10% of the time I am on the computer using it. The other 90% it's spotty at best. We even got a booster/router, whatever it's called, to try to improve the signal from the main input to the rest of the house, which is under 1300 square feet. It's ridiculous, when the heater turns on, that even interferes with the signal because it's not strong enough. It is not reliable and can go off at any time for seemingly no reason too.\r\n\r\nThe customer service by phone and on website is rude and useless in that order. In person, if service is sent out and you get someone knowledgeable, which is 90% of the time, fortunately. You guaranteed good service though when you have a house call and that is what you usually get and they will fix what is fixable. But they charge you a fortune.", "Overall above average, except for pricing. Looking for alternative. Don't trust these guys now that net neutrality got repealed.

They have overcharged all customers for all these years and now everyone is cutting the cord and now they are trying to force everyone into paying for crap that was never agreed to in the 1st place. They also know they are the only internet provider in Las Cruces, NM so they think they can bully their customers around. \r\n\r\nShame on Comcast for ripping off their customers. My internet is costing $148.00 a month and not fiber optics. They are telling us we can pay an additional $50.00 a month for unlimited. This is a complete abuse of power on their part. I hope they lose all customers for forcing them into abusive overcharges. There needs to be competition in this town for Comcast.

They represent the very worst of the typical American corporation. Their Internet service is fairly good and dependable, but that is the ONLY thing they have going for them. I pay nearly $100 per month just for Internet service and they have the nerve to force a 1TB data cap on me!!! I've done the math. One 2-hour HD movie alone can take up to up 3GB alone, and I've been fanatically watching the World Cup this month, so we've reached our 1TB cap.

On the website? \"Device found! You can now activate...\" Except when I activate, I get \"issues\" and \"errors\" messages, two on one page in some instance. And that's what Xfinity has become.

When turning in equipment, although told the contract was now cancelled - the only thing they cancelled was the autopay. Now the last real bill to be paid, which looks like it has been paid, has not. (Be sure to look at the small print on the bill as to the exact dates that have been paid - the billing cycle is 3 weeks late and arrives at the same time as the last payment!) So now there is a late fee to pay in addition to a breakage fee, and a long wait online to correct the end of service which was never recorded. \r\n\r\nJust for all the aggravation, they should waive the breakage fee, but honestly, if they are not providing the service at the new address, they should waive this punishment. (See the original contract details - they are desperate for every dime and make their employees toe the line to get it.) This unrelenting stance with clients who have been with them for years and paid faithfully will come back to bite them.

I am a small business totally dependent on phone and internet to conduct our business and COMCAST has cost us the loss of many $$$. Your service representative and anything but friendly, they are disrespectful and insulting. My disgust is so great that I have decided to completely remove COMCAST as my service provider in both my locations. \r\n\r\nAlthough I clearly understand that I am small account and meaningless to COMCAST I will make every attempt to discredit your company and the services you provide. You have no business in providing businesses with phone or internet service. You have no idea how to handle that market. Your business is television programming and dealing with the residential customers that will tolerate your lack of consideration and appreciation. You are overpriced and poor provider of service. I have filed reports with the FCC and FTC about your improper billing practices and services, I can continue for hours on this matter but it would be to no avail for the past six months I have HAD OVER 60 CR TICKETS ON MY ACCOUNT.

Every time we contacted customer service they would say something different about the cancellation. They also do not have an option of just home Wi-Fi, they force you to get tv plans with them, we did not even watch tv. Overall we are not satisfied because of the several issues.

I've been with Comcast for over 10 years and have never shopped around behind their backs nor have I ever paid a bill late. Yet they repay my loyalty by moving beyond their typical nickel and dime tactics to screwing me out of every penny possible. Unlike cable, having access to the internet is a necessity and with little, to no competition, Comcast knows you'll have to pay the overages and like it. I don't torrent and I do my best to block the data before my family hits the cap, I've tried adding my number for an alert but I have yet to receive one nor have I ever been the lucky recipient of the notice that is sent to the current data user, whichever of my kids notices it just ignores it and keeps on streaming. \r\n\r\nI canceled the streaming services that Comcast is using the data caps and overage charges to stifle the competition of but somehow I still ended up with overages and charges. I've already been hit with at least a couple hundred dollars in overages since the caps were implemented a couple years back. My only option with Comcast is to continue stressing about the overages or I can ante up an additional $50 per month for the exact service I had prior to the cap. Fortunately, I have a choice and recently switched to CenturyLink, the performance is comparable but I no longer have the worry of getting hit with Comcast's greedy cash grab.", "I was a Comcast customer for over 14 years. The customer service has always been an issue, but due to my home location Comcast was my preferred option as the competing company also had a ton complaints. Prior to moving I added Comcast home security. At the time of service I informed the rep I was moving within the year and inquired about cancellation fees if Comcast was not a service provider in the new area. (I was building at that time and there were a lot of questions regarding service providers in the area). I was informed I would not be responsible for cancellation fees if Comcast did not service the area. Six months later I sold my home and moved into an apartment which had a contract with AT&T. During that time I also learned Comcast would not be allowed to service the new development.\r\n\r\nWhen I called Comcast I was initially given a lot of inaccurate information and finally informed it was at Comcast's discretion and I would have to pay $660 for cancelling the home security (not including any equipment) and 350 for the internet (which I've had for years). I've been going back and forth with Comcast for a year now and finally caved in to prevent it from hitting my credit report. I've requested documentation and/or recording supporting the internet contractual agreement and was denied.\r\n\r\nI do NOT recommend this company for phone, internet, cable, or home security. During the sale of the home the alarm was triggered by maintenance and the police never showed. During the time I was in the apartment I used AT&T, was informed if I moved I would not be responsible for cancellation. This time I requested it in writing prior to signing and when I moved into my home all I had to do was make a phone call. I could not believe how easy and stress free it was to cancel.", "I am a current Comcast cable customer. I recently applied for an affordable internet service for my family through Internet Essentials by Comcast for $9.95/mo. I was approved for the service and waiting for my equipment for nearly 2 weeks. I decided to call internet essentials to obtain the status on my internet equipment. They advised me that I would have to upgrade my cable package with Comcast since my Comcast cable package didn't allow me to get internet service through Internet Essentials. I contacted Comcast cable and they advised me I would have to upgrade to a more expensive cable package, get internet directly through Comcast with a bundle deal, or downgrade my cable service to basic cable with less channels to get affordable internet through Internet Essentials. \r\n\r\nI never signed any contract that would prevent me from getting internet service through Internet Essentials. I do not understand how Comcast is preventing me from getting an affordable internet service for my family. I should be able to get Internet service from any company any time I want and should not be forced to pay extra.

I called him on the lie and he ended up hanging up on me! My advice to anyone shopping around: The $5/month you may save on your bill is not worth the headache dealing with Comcast Customer Service! This is not the first time we have had terrible experiences with Comcast.", "I very rarely leave reviews on any product (especially if my feelings are negative), but I've decided to make an exception in this case because of the underhanded and execrable experience I've had over the last two years. I make my living online and therefore obviously require internet in order to do my job. Unfortunately, the area in which I live is only served by Comcast so I was forced to go with them as my ISP. I was pleased during my first year of service, and I didn't really have any issues with consistent speeds, rates, etc. However, during the second year of service, I've had numerous issues such as 1) increased rates without warning, 2) speed caps where my internet speed slows from 150 mbps to 30mbps-50mbps, and 3) disrespectful service agents via chat. \r\n\r\nI was able to solve the rate issue after some frustrated phone conversations, but the speed issue is really what made me angry. I kept noticing how slow things were running, ran a speed test and sure enough, speeds were running at FAR less than what I was paying for. Usually these types of issues are related to the amount of users that an ISP has in a certain area and not being able to service everyone at max speed during high traffic times. I get that, but as soon as I called and COMPLAINED, they said they would \"restart my modem\" and WOW my speeds were MAGICALLY back up to what they were supposed to be. \r\n\r\nNote that I had already restarted my modem numerous times before that but whatever. Maybe it was an issue that happened on their end. In any case, when that issue happened numerous times with the same result, needless to say I was extremely frustrated and it became obvious what they are doing. Anyway, I will say that their support chat has gotten quite a bit better, but if you have any choice of ISP, I would recommend going with someone else.

I called Comcast and asked them for service and I made it clear that I was living at a temporary address and that I plan on keeping Comcast service as long as it's available. I told them that my home search area included areas where Comcast did not have coverage but the rep told me, \"Don't worry, if you buy a home in an area not serviced by Comcast you can leave a contract early without an early termination penalty.\" Made sense to me.\r\n\r\nNow fast forward 6 months later and Comcast has sent my case to collections for a $186 early termination fee even though they can't provide service to my house. I say this as a warning, buyer beware... record every conversation (legally) you have with them when establishing service because their reps say things that are not true and unless recorded they deny it ever was said.

The first Comcast customer service rep was in Honduras, and had us go through a bunch of instructions while on the phone which totally messed up our TV to the point of one channel only and no sound, no guide, etc. Everything was out on it.

After which, I noticed the speed seemed to really start slowing down, so I contacted Comcast, and their customer service recommended their next Plan: Blast for really fast internet speed (@ only $74.95 a month). The internet price increases started after initially paying $54.95 a month and kept getting higher. The Plan: BLAST has currently increased to $92.95 monthly. In my family's home, we have been using the same exact devices as discussed with Comcast when we initially began using their services (which we are allowed up to 4-5 devices). We use a 1 desktop, 1 laptop, 1 t.v., and a cell phone (occasionally).\r\n\r\nTODAY, at $92.95 a month the internet service is even worse.

Also, the representative said there was nothing more that they could do to help.\r\n\r\nWe are still stuck at only a speed of 14.5 mbps. We're getting bad service!

I check my connections because clearly something is wrong here. I call (automated system). I have a balance but my bill isn\u2019t due until 10/27/18? Like how is that even possible? I don\u2019t know of any reputable company that allows their employees to maliciously handle customer accounts. Isn\u2019t there some type of security mechanism that prevents employees from accessing accounts unless the account holder provides a passcode or something? If not, there should be. I\u2019m patiently waiting for 7a. to see what excuse they give me this time. I mean... it\u2019s not like they have the best or even average customer service. Bad enough I\u2019m unconvinced by the disruption of service and to have to deal with a rude rep. C\u2019mon Xfinity. At least try to be great on some level with your customer service please and thank you.", "Comcast is the absolute worst. I call because my internet went out, by no fault of my own or the weather, and ask for a tech to come out and they tell me they can get a tech to my house in a WEEK!? Then, I figure out the issue myself after about an hour of trying. They are no help on the phone, every person I have ever talked to was incredibly rude and inconsiderate. Then, about a month later I move to another address and ask for them to move my service, so they move it, BUT in my original contract with them I had internet and Comcast Streaming... when I get to my new address I try to login to my streaming account and it says that I have to sign up for this service that I do not have it with my package. \r\n\r\nI call Comcast and they tell me that when I moved that my service got changed by the person who did the move and that the service that I had was no longer offered to new customers but that they could give me movie channels, I don't want movie channels. I want what I originally signed up for. THEY MESSED UP MY SERVICE, and couldn't give it back because it wasn't offered to new customers even though I had it and was using it the previous day??!! So because one of their \"customer service agents\" didn't know what they were doing I got screwed out of my original plan and now still have to pay the same -higher- amount for just internet and like 3 movie channels that I don't even use... AVOID COMCAST AT ANY COST. NOT WORTH IT.", "I\u2019m not sure where to start. Please choose another company if you have a choice. This company has cost me over 10000 in the last five years. Internet down all day and I\u2019m losing $150/hr and they offer me $2.32 for compensation. I\u2019m still in shock... Internet goes out all the time. Night and day. Someone please create a real company that will treat their clients with respect and deliver a real product for a reasonable price. I\u2019ll be waiting.", "Ok I have always had problems with Comcast from bad service to extremely bad customer service. I recently had to turn in Comcast the FCC for charging me an 11.00 monthly fee for my own modem stating to me that it was malfunctioning because I wasn't paying a fee. Comcast was the only company in my area so I had no other options. Finally when I moved to another area, there were other companies and I thought I would never have to deal with them again. I had given them my forwarding address so I could get the final bill. \r\n\r\nWhen I got it, it said it was late now and had to be paid. They had just sent me the bill. I called to pay it and the automation wouldn't recognize my number because I canceled my account. I called Comcast. They insisted I didn't owe them anything. Knowing them as I do I asked for a supervisor who said, \"Just pay the bill and we will send you a refund check if you don't owe it.\" He then proceeded to tell me there was going to be a 5.00 charge for not using the automation. What? This company is run by a bunch of inept pirates. Never deal with them. Worst company on the planet.", "They sent me an extra modem and billed me double once they realized their mistake. My only options were to drive 45 minutes to return it or pay $70 for someone to come pick it up. Also, internet is slow and when initializing service the salesmen are incredibly pushy and dishonest about simple plans. I live alone and have a laptop and a cell phone, and had to ask for another rep because the first one refused to tell me about any package other than one that supports 10-15 devices. Find someone else.", "Comcast will promise you anything but all you can do is just watch your bill increase every month. They will tell you lies that they will return to correct price but never do. Don't be fooled by their promotions as they will not honor them. I was warned by previous customers and now I wish I had heeded the warnings. As soon as my contract is up I am so done with Comcast.", "I contacted Comcast to see if I would be better off using an Internet and TV package from them instead of DISH. Comcast (Xfinity) customer service told me their lowest TV programming alone started at $79.95 and if I wanted to \"record\" or have \"high definition\", well, there would be a charge for each, and then a charge for an \"extra television\", you know, the old DISH TV charges that they want you to fall for as \"extras\". Customer service woman told me I would be better off with DISH. This is why I dislike Comcast so much. They are so big and they don't care about their customers.\r\n\r\nOf course, they are offering a streaming option now, that is most the same as DISH, a low charge, and a ripoff, they tell you what you will get but they don't tell you what you don't get. It is a stupid option. Like, you can stream and but you have no local channels. They tell you have 50 channels, and that is all, I tell you, they take away what you had with the bottom package, or second from the bottom package, that you had with them, no \"normal\" TV watching. The chat person will order the streaming channel for you, but they won't talk to you about it, they won't tell you what the streaming channel really is, they will just send it to you via your email or text, so they don't have to explain it. Comcast and DISH have not much to offer in the way of customer service for TV viewing unless you pay thru the nose.", "On Sept 3 I ordered internet service. Tech showed up the next day and said the only Sage installation would be underground. I received notice on Sept 5 of the pending install. Service was to be activated in approximately 4 weeks. I called on Oct 12 and was told my order was canceled and that I would have to speak with a specific manager. Numerous calls were not returned. I called customer service again and was told I was canceled because I did not register my modem in time. I escalated again and was told the manager would review my case and get back to me. I got a follow up call saying they were working on it, and heard nothing more.\r\n\r\nMore than a week later on Nov 2 I called again and was told the same thing. They escalated and got PERMISSION to reissue the order, but was told the $24.99 promo pricing was no longer available - it would be $34.99. This is the worst customer experience I have had in many years. Avoid dealing with this company! This should be 0 stars - a complete waste of time.", "Horrible service. Technical support reps are DISRESPECTFUL so is the supervisor, Ronald was his name (at least what he told me) badge ID ** (don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even legit).

Then finally got transferred to the supervisor, I told him about the situation. He offered no help and said, \"A technician can only show up at a certain time. If you are not available you\u2019ll have to make someone else available\" (thanks for making it so convenient not like I pay anything) after I told him 10 times no one is available at the time he\u2019s purposing.

It get to the point that my phone's internet is faster and less faulty than my home wifi.", "Comcast customer service is getting worst, I had internet issue which they could not fixed even coming to my house and still got charges, I explicitly told them to make sure I do not get charges if they going to come out. The technician came out, could not fix the issue and told me I would not get charge and now they are refused to remove the charges.

They abuse their monopoly.", "We have been out of Internet service for 5 weeks. During the past 5 weeks, Comcast had sent 3 technicians and still hasn\u2019t fixed the problem. When we called again tonight to ask for status, the person who answered the call was not able to view our service records, nor was his immediate supervisor. Not sure how Comcast can operate a company this way, and no wonder after 3 technicians came the problem is still not fixed. We have requested for refund and will change the Internet service to another company. NEVER CONSIDER COMCAST!!! It\u2019s the WORST internet/cable company I have ever known.", "So I finally got my own apartment and needed to set up internet service. Initially, I was going to just get internet but the Comcast rep told me it would be a better deal to do a bundle for TV and internet. I said that's great as long as I would get 2 specific channels, to which he said they were included. Great, I got the package. However it was a lie and I never got those channels, was tricked into a 3-year contract and now have to pay to get out. When I contacted Comcast about it they said they had no notes about it, even though I had multiple techs come out for the channels. Meanwhile, they also said I would have to pay the same $90 for 250 MBPS while competition charges that much for 1GBPS when asked if they would match the competition's price they said no. I will be going to AT&T and avoid Comcast at all costs.", "They put a sign on my door to call when the construction already damaged the property and destroyed the landscaping. I tried to call, but you can't get through, that machine keep saying, \"I NEED YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER.\" I don't have an account number, I DON'T HAVE CABLE AND I DON'T WANT CABLE. They sound like the Mafia, I take it as a threat, when they say they will destroy landscaping and might damage the property. Who gives them the right to do so, who will pay for the damage??? They need to do construction in the properties where they have and want cable, not in mine.", "When I moved to Elizabethtown KY I had a choice of 3 cable providers. One was a local company with narrow broadband services, another was a satellite company which had poor service and Comcast so I elected to get Comcast Xfinity. That was a major mistake. I had to agree to a 2 year service agreement which was no real problem. Unfortunately, Comcast isn't required to agree to provide quality service. In the 14 months I have been with Comcast I have had consistent terrible service every week related to internet connection and cable services which also include the landline phone which is basically provided free which seems to be the only service that is worth the price they charge (which has gone up twice since I began service). \r\n\r\nAfter having several service calls to my residence related to connectivity problems I had a service rep advise me that the area I live in has been having problems with their service due to a bad node on the tower that provides service. Comcast/Xfinity never informed any of its customers and since that visit approximately 30 days ago, service has continued to get worse. My service as well as all customers in the area I live in have lost all services for 10-12 hours in a single day on at least 3 separate occasions and the last outage went from 10:30 a.m on 9/19/18 thru late evening 9/24/18 with services being down from 1-3 hours to 10+ hours every day over that period. I contacted Xfinity several times during this last outage and was told that a supervisor would call me back but never did and when I asked for an adjustment to my bill I was told that the supervisor would discuss that when my call was returned.\r\n\r\nComcast has known about the problem with the node for several months and hasn't notified any of the affected customers nor have they offered to adjust the bills and have also failed to properly repair or replace the bad node. This is absolutely the leader in POOR/SHABBY service and I would NOT recommend their services to anyone. In addition to the poor services provided the customers' service telephone system is set up to make it very difficult to even speak with a live person. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I am looking for another provider and will cancel all services with this company whether my contract is up or not and will gladly go to court if they try to collect any fees for early termination. All I can say about Comcast/Xfinity is they should be the poster child for pitiful service and a company that puts profit ahead of providing quality service to its customers. Last words on Comcast \"DO NOT USE COMCAST\". You might as well throw your money into the street and at least someone will benefit from it.", "I HAVE NEVER had Comcast but this was the WORST experience I have ever had with customer service. Krystal ext. ** put a BLOCK on my rental property because someone else called in with my same address who had a previous problem with Comcast.

I think the fact that internet stopped will suddenly increase after calling them to complain is the proof in the pudding. They also keep trying to put the blame on my modem.

My first time calling yesterday, I was stuck talking to a recording for ~30 minutes only to be told to unplug and replug my router, which I had already done on my own. I thought maybe it would fix itself and left it alone for the day. Now today my internet still no longer works for longer than 10 minutes, and every time it goes down requires that I go and reset the router again. I call again and was stuck talking to a automated voice message for a frustrating amount of time. \r\n\r\nThe lady who helped me was useless, and basically the only thing she could do for me was explain to how to unplug and plug in my router... I explained that I had done this exact same thing multiple times and requested that she do something else, but she insisted on doing it this way. My internet began to work after I reset it as it had been, which I explained to her and asked for a number I could call to directly speak to a live representative in case the problem continued. The number she gave me when I called, was not a valid number. TERRIBLE customer service!!! WHAT'S UP COMCAST???", "Let me start with an opinion and then I'll go into factual details. Comcast customer service is absolutely the worst. The only company I have dealt with that was worse was a company that told me they couldn't help me figure out why their device was working and suggested I try Googling the issue. I suppose Comcast product is OK, it is their billing and customer service that is absolutely horrible. My first big problem with them is when they talked me into trying their gigabit internet service. While they immediately billed me for the premium service I only received the premium service for about a day, the day they signed me up. \r\n\r\nAfter a long drawn out fight with them I got them to switch me back the plan I was on before and give me credit for overbilling. Initially they were going to charge me early cancellation fee to move my billing to match the product they were delivering. My current fight with them is they keep claiming I'm exceeding the 1TB data cap on the plan I'm on. They claim this is third month this has happened and now they are going to charge me overages. The problem is they refuse to support their claim.", "In July I moved from one location to another within the same city and had to make no fewer than 30 phone calls to get my new service established and learned today that they have been billing BOTH locations on my credit card since July and are refusing to refund the duplicate billing. Comcast is truly a horribly managed company and treats their customers like dirt.", "We signed up for service over a month ago. Still no service. Two service appointments, the first was a no show by Xfinity on 12/3, after driving an hour and waiting for 4 hours for the tech to show up. Our next appointment, (and the earliest they could schedule), was scheduled for tomorrow 12/9, between 5 and 7 pm. They called tonight (12/8) to inform us the tech rescheduled for 1-3, a time we could not accommodate. I was informed by the rep, rudely, \"She did not have to apologize to me\". Thinking of heading to small claims court for the waste of my time. Horrible, horrible experience and extreme waste of time. Oh! And she (the latest of many inept reps) informed me if I didn't want to continue service, I had to personally return the equipment or be charge 60 dollars for them to pick it up. Again, horrible experience.", "Lots of outages that affect all of our services. They cut through a main sprinkler line which has caused high water bills, dead plants and costly sprinkler repair. I have called 7 times in two months without a return call. The manager that I finally spoke to was arrogant and could not give a darn if we kept their services or not.", "Comcast has already been fined $2.3 million dollars for billing fraud and is still at it with their 1TB data caps. I have a secure internet connection where all traffic is monitored on my end. In 10 days Comcast claims I have used 366GB while my own meter shows 131GB. They use an outside company called Netforce to monitor the data usage and claim it is 94% accurate. I have had to call 3 times now on this issue and have been told that it was escalated to Netforce and if they don't find any wrongdoing then I'm responsible for their claimed data usage. The 1TB cap is pointless, it does not cost them any extra money to continue providing you internet and you're charged a premium for every 10GB of data used over that 1TB. It's amazing that gas and electricity utilities can accurately measure usage and Comcast can't but still expects to be able to bill you based on it.", "Been all over the 5 continents and seriously this is the worse of all. Third world countries have better internet services. We lose internet several times during the month and it takes us several hours each time to get hold of incompetent agents who can't figure the issue then we have to wait for several days to schedule a tech to come check the problem... We have decided now to cancel this extremely d\u00e9class\u00e9 substandard service. Advice to users to ever never get this poor service... I still can't believe it how they can get away with this and that they are still in business.", "I've had to deal with Comcast since 2008 when Verizon bills got higher so I thought I'd give Comcast a chance. I believe Comcast has better TV so I got the internet service with Comcast believing all internet technology by then was the same. I have had problems from day 1 and it is always something else or my fault. I have finally realized they are full of it. How do they get away with this? I just got Gig speed thinking it would help and Guess what? Speed got slower! They are sending a tech but I expect the same old BS! STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST!"]
